    "text": "The following description of the business should be read in conjunction with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. This description contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements due to the factors set forth in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. provides cutting-edge trading and investment solutions to investors around the world. The Company is committed to defining markets through product innovation, leading edge technology, and seamless trading solutions.\nCboe offers trading across a diverse range of products in multiple asset classes and geographies, including options, futures, U.S., Canadian and European equities, exchange-traded products (“ETPs”), global foreign exchange (“FX”) and volatility products based on the VIX Index, recognized as the world’s premier gauge of U.S. equity market volatility.\nCboe’s subsidiaries include the largest options exchange and the third largest stock exchange operator in the U.S. In addition, the Company operates one of the largest stock exchanges by value traded in Europe, and owns EuroCCP, a leading pan-European equities clearinghouse, BIDS Trading, a leading block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S., and MATCHNow, a leading equities ATS in Canada. Cboe also is a leading market globally for ETP listings and trading.\nThe graphic below provides a brief overview of Cboe’s history:\n​\n7\nOur Business\nCboe Global Markets reports on the following five business segments:\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 17 (“Segment Reporting”) in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of revenues, and operating income (or loss) by business segment. Certain activities within our segments operate globally. For information regarding risks related to our international operations see “Risk Factors.”\n​\n8\nThe following chart lists average daily transaction volume in number of shares/contracts, notional value transacted or trades cleared for Options (Cboe Options, C2 Options, BZX Options, and EDGX Options); Futures (CFE); U.S. Equities (BZX Equities, BYX Equities, EDGA Equities, and EDGX Equities); Canadian Equities (MATCHNow); European Equities (Cboe Europe Equities); European Clearing (EuroCCP); and Global FX (Cboe FX and Cboe SEF) for the periods indicated:\n​\n​\nADV= average daily volume\nADNV= average daily notional value\nCompetitive Strengths\nAt Cboe, we are defining markets to benefit participants and drive the global marketplace forward through product innovation, leading edge technology and seamless trading solutions.\nOur legacy of innovation not only includes products, but also the creation or acquisition of entirely new markets or market models, including the first listed-options marketplace, the first alternative venue to traditional equity markets, the first pan-European MTF and the first electronic communication network (“ECN”) for the institutional FX market. These markets have grown to become some of the largest, most relied upon in the world.\n9\nValue Proposition\nWe also believe that we provide stakeholders with a strong value proposition due to the following key drivers:\nKey Growth Strategy Initiatives\nWe expect to further grow our business and increase our revenues and profitability by pursuing the following growth strategies:\n10\nProprietary Products\nIn addition to our exchanges providing a marketplace and listing venue for the trading of securities and derivatives we also calculate proprietary indices that are used as the basis for proprietary products, such as our SPX options and VIX options and futures, or licensed for use by third parties. These include:\nOur most frequently traded proprietary products are SPX options and VIX options and futures. In addition to any transaction fee revenue generated on products created based on these indices, we have granted licenses for third parties to use and sublicense some of these proprietary indices to create third-party indices and products. Accordingly, we generate revenue from proprietary indices by distributing them for reference purposes, using them as the basis for proprietary products and licensing them for use for third-party indices and products.\nThese proprietary indices and products are built both through our in-house research and development staff and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers. The following is a discussion of our strategic relationships and additional detail on our most frequently traded products, including SPX options and VIX options and futures.\nStrategic Relationships\nThe Company has long-term business relationships with several providers of market indices. We license their indices, including on an exclusive basis, as the foundation for indices, index options and other products. The Company also acquires interests in and agrees to work jointly with key providers to develop new products and services that are expected to capitalize on our core competencies and diversify our sources of revenue. Of particular note are the following:\n11\nSPX Options\nThe S&P 500 Index is an index comprised of 500 large-cap U.S. listed companies. It is one of the most commonly followed indices and is considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy. The SPX options we offer on the S&P 500 Index are exclusive to Cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fees. Because of the S&P 500 Index’s status as a bellwether, SPX options are used in many different trading strategies by customers with different goals, including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options, asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using risk-managed strategies to capture so-called “risk premia” embedded in option prices. We also offer SPX Weeklys options, which have settlements on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and on the last trading day of each month. We believe these additional expirations provide customers with more precision when hedging overall portfolio risk.\nVolatility Trading\nCboe pioneered the trading of exchange-traded volatility products with its introduction of VIX futures in 2004 and VIX options in 2006. The VIX Index, although not directly tradable, is based on the mid-point of real-time quotes of SPX options and is designed to reflect investors’ consensus view of future 30-day expected stock market volatility. The VIX methodology provides the basis for the creation of VIX options and futures. The final settlement value of VIX derivatives is determined on their expiration date through a Special Opening Quotation (“SOQ”) of the VIX Index. The SOQ calculation uses opening trade prices of selected options; unless there is no opening price, in which case the opening price used in the SOQ calculation is the midpoint of the highest bid and lowest offer at the time of the opening. Since we started offering these products, we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies, including hedging extreme stock market declines, also known as “tail risk” hedging, and risk-managed strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future. We also offer VIX Weeklys options and futures to provide investors with opportunities and tools to trade volatility over a shorter term.\nListing\nCboe serves as a listing destination for ETPs in the U.S. and Europe, and its markets are structured and designed for ETP issuers and their investors. In 2020, Cboe added 114 ETP listings in the U.S. and won 36 percent of all new U.S. ETP listings. There are now 511 ETPs globally listed on Cboe from 63 different issuers. We offer fully-\nautomated opening, closing and halt reopening auctions for our listed securities, which are designed to maximize the efficiency of the price discovery process.\nCboe also offers issuers the choice of an innovative market maker program referred to as the Cboe Lead Market Maker (“LMM”) incentive program on Cboe BZX and the Cboe Europe Equities Liquidity Provider Program (“LPP”) on Cboe Europe Equities. Under the LMM program, an LMM has certain quoting obligations and for meeting those enhanced obligations, Cboe pays the LMM a daily stipend that varies depending on the average aggregate daily auction volume in the ETPs assigned to such LMM. Also, LMMs transact for free in the closing auction in their assigned ETPs. Under the LPP, Cboe Europe Equities offers three programs designed for participants that wish to provide liquidity by posting and maintaining executable quotes within certain set parameters with the result of providing liquidity on a regular and ongoing basis. Cboe BZX also offers the Cboe Liquidity Management Provider (“LMP”) Program (“LMP Program”). The LMP Program is a rewards-based program that incentivizes liquidity providers to make a better market in ETPs. Incentives are based on an LMP’s quote quality in the Cboe LMP Program securities, which include all Cboe-listed ETPs and certain non-Cboe-listed ETPs.\nMarket Data and Information Solutions\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from market data fees from U.S. tape plans, including Unlisted Trading Privileges (“UTPs”), the Consolidated Tape Association (“CTA”) and OPRA. Fees, net of plan costs, from UTP, CTA, and OPRA are allocated and distributed to plan participants like us according to their share of tape fees based on a formula, required by Regulation NMS, which may take into account both trading and quoting activity.\n12\nWe also provide a robust offering of market data and information solutions products across multiple asset classes and geographic regions that are designed to suit our customers’ diverse needs. Products include real-time depth of book quotation information, auction and complex option information, top of book quotes and trades, last sale information, consolidated equity feeds, real-time index values, and trade reporting facility information. With our recent information solutions acquisitions, we have expanded our services to include analytics services, theoretical values, alpha generating tools, probability data, and historical information for our markets through multiple data services, which include Silexx, LiveVol, Hanweck, FT Options, and Trade Alert.\nOur Models\nOur markets use a combination of pricing and market models to differentiate them from each other and from our competitors. For our options markets, Cboe Options is a hybrid market combining open outcry floor trading with electronic trading. For multi-listed products, we utilize public customer priority, market turner in certain products, participation rights and pro-rata allocation market models, combined with the “classic” pricing model. Under the classic pricing model, professional participants pay transaction fees, public customers generally do not pay transaction fees and market makers compensate brokers for sending order flow to the exchange (known as payment for order flow). For proprietary products, we use price-time or pro-rata allocation, sometimes with public customer priority, and market turner market models, combined with a pricing model where all market participants generally pay fees. Our other three options markets are fully electronic. BZX options utilizes a price-time market model, combined with a “maker-taker” pricing model. Under the maker-taker pricing model, market participants who make the market (a “maker”) generally receive a rebate, while market participants who trade against those markets (a “taker”) pay a transaction fee. EDGX options utilizes customer priority, participation rights and pro-rata allocation market models, combined with the classic pricing model. C2 options utilizes a pro-rata allocation market model, combined with the maker-taker pricing model.\nFor our U.S. equities exchanges, which are fully electronic, BZX equities utilizes a price-time market model, combined with the maker-taker pricing model. EDGX equities utilizes a price-time with retail priority market model, combined with the maker-taker pricing model. BYX equities utilizes a price-time with price improvement for retail customers market model, combined with the “taker-maker” pricing model. Under the taker-maker pricing model, market participants who make the market pay a transaction fee, while market participants who trade against those markets receive a rebate. EDGA equities utilizes a price-time market model, combined with a taker-maker pricing model. In addition to these market models, each of the U.S. equity exchanges provide numerous specific order types that are designed to enhance their respective market models.\nFor our Canadian equities ATS, which is fully electronic, MATCHNow utilizes a model that combines frequent call matches and continuous execution opportunities in a confidential trading book. The system uses real-time quotes for protected transparent Canadian markets. Orders matched within MATCHNow are executed at three levels of price improvement: (1) the mid-point between the Canadian best bid and offer (the “CBBO”); (2) one price increment better than the CBBO or; (3) at the bid or offer for orders that meet a specified large threshold. Trading fees are typically calculated as a function of trade volume and share price.\nFor our U.S. equities ATS market, which is fully electronic, BIDS Trading utilizes a sponsored access model to provide anonymous executions in NMS stocks. BIDS Trading provides numerous order types, including both firm and conditional orders. All orders matched within BIDS Trading are executed at or better than the NBBO. BIDS Trading charges fees based on disclosed, objective criteria: (i) means of access; (ii) the type of order; and (iii) the total volume of executions during the calendar month.\nFor our futures market, which is fully electronic, CFE utilizes a price-time market model, combined with a pricing model where all market participants generally pay fees, subject to specified exceptions.\nOur Cboe FX platform utilizes a price-firmness-time priority market model, combined with a pricing model where users are charged either a flat or tiered commission rate based upon the notional amount traded on the platform. Our Cboe SEF platform charges a flat commission based upon the notional amount traded on the platform and the capacity in which a participant is trading.\nIn Europe, following the implementation of the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (Directive 2014/65/EU) (“MiFID II”), rebates are generally available if they are tied to a market making scheme or specific service.\n13\nOur exchanges also charge fees for the opportunity to trade or access our exchanges, including fees for trading-related functionality. To facilitate trading, we also charge fees for certain technology services, terminal and other equipment rights, maintenance services, trading floor space and telecommunications services.\nClearing\nOn July 1, 2020, we completed our acquisition of EuroCCP, a European central counterparty (“CCP”), that provides post-trade services, including clearing, to stock exchanges, multilateral trading facilities and for over-the-counter equities trades. EuroCCP acts as a central counterparty that, for its clearing participants, becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. As a result, it guarantees the timely performance of the obligations of buyers and sellers and takes on the risk of the performance of the transactions that it clears. Additionally, as a critical Financial Market Infrastructure, EuroCCP is subject to strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight. In 2020, EuroCCP provided CCP protection for an average of\n€\n41 billion of cleared value on a daily basis. Through the process of netting, in 2020, EuroCCP eliminated 80% or\n€\n30 billion of the average daily cleared value, leaving an average daily settlement value of\n€\n11 billion.\nCustomers\nOur customers generally include financial institutions, trading platforms, institutional and individual investors and professional traders. Our equities and options customers in the United States include trading permit holders and members of Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, which are SEC-registered broker-dealers, and the customers of those broker-dealers. Our Canadian equities customers include participants of MATCHNow, which are Canadian registered investment dealers, and certain clients of those dealers. Our ATS equities participants in the United States include users of BIDS Trading, which are SEC-registered broker-dealers and certain customers of those broker-dealers. Our futures customers include banks, futures commission merchants and their customers, hedge funds, asset managers, proprietary trading firms and Commodity Trading Advisors. Similarly, our equities’ customers in Europe are European Union (“EU”) regulated brokerage and proprietary trading firms, as well as sponsored access clients of these brokerage firms, and certain non-EU. regulated and unregulated direct access participants. EuroCCP clears equities from 18 European markets and from the United States, as well as Depositary Receipts, ETFs, and exchange traded currencies (“ETCs”). Our institutional global FX customers include banks, broker-dealers, hedge funds, asset managers, proprietary trading firms, Commodity Trading Advisors and corporates. Access to our markets, trading rights and privileges depend upon the nature of the customer, such as whether the individual is a trading permit holder, trading privilege holder, member or participant of one of our markets.\nCompetition\nThe industry in which we operate is intensely competitive. We believe we face competition on a number of factors, including:\nWe believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors through a variety of methods, including:\n14\nIn our proprietary products, we compete against other futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products, as well as against financial market participants that offer similar over-the-counter derivatives. We also compete against certain multi-listed options products, such as options on SPY, which may offer similar market exposure of our proprietary products such as SPX options.\nThe multi-listed options industry is extremely competitive. We expect this trend to continue. As of December 31, 2020, we compete with 12 U.S. options exchanges, in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology. Most of the equity and ETP options listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on the other exchanges. In addition, the options exchanges that we compete with set fees and rebates to attract multi-listed options business to their exchanges, which has historically reduced the net revenue per contract that we generate from multi-listed options, and the options exchanges that we compete with structure their options businesses in partnership with established market participants, such as consolidators, and other order flow providers, to increase their volume traded.\nOur U.S. listed equity securities and listing services and the BIDS Trading ATS compete against 12 other exchanges as of December 31, 2020, and several other ATSs and single dealer platforms. Market participants have multiple venues for the execution of orders, including national securities exchanges and numerous off-exchange venues, including other ATSs and broker-dealers who internalize orders off-exchange. Additionally, issuers have multiple venues for the listing of their products. In Canada, our equities ATS, MATCHNow, competes with several Canadian exchanges and other ATSs.\nThe market for execution and clearing services in Europe became more competitive following the introduction of MiFID II and the Regulation on Markets in Financial Instruments (Regulation (EU) No 600/2014) (“MiFIR”). Furthermore, MiFID II and MiFIR placed more onerous conditions on trading venues and investment firms and restricted certain types of trading activity. Our major competitors in Europe include national stock exchanges, other pan-European MTFs, European clearinghouses, dark pools, and systematic internalizers.\nThe global FX market remains severely fragmented, with transparent automated marketplaces such as Cboe FX challenging a small number of similarly situated competitors. While the global FX market has experienced a shift from competing interbank platforms to ECNs, the electronification of the spot and NDF FX market may encounter resistance from customers that still prefer to utilize the phone, instant chats, terminals and key banking relationships for price discovery and trading. Furthermore, electronification of the FX market appears to be experiencing more resistance outside the United States. The electronic spot FX market is also intensely competitive, with over 10 other venues competing for market share as of December 31, 2020. Cboe measures and reports on market share against a narrower set of competitors, included in those venues.\nIn addition, demand for our market data faces competition from other securities exchanges, technology companies, third-party market data providers and information and software vendors, who have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchanges or trading venues. The sale of our proprietary data products is also under competitive threat from ATSs and trading venues that offer similar products. Distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products.\nTechnology\nCboe Trading Technology\nThe trading platform for our equities, options and futures markets is developed, owned and operated in-house and is designed to optimize reliability, speed, scalability and versatility. Each of our exchanges provide different market models, appealing to different user bases and the trading technologies support all of them. Further, the technologies are designed to support many specialized features for each of the markets, such as: dark pools, trade reporting facility, systematic internalizer, Large-in-Scale, smart order routing, FLEX options, 24x5 trading and hybrid trading (combining electronic and open outcry). In addition, Cboe operates separate trading and clearing platforms, as applicable, for BIDS Trading, MATCHNow, EuroCCP, and Global FX.\nOur trading platforms have experienced very low operational downtime and low latency. The trading platforms use readily available hardware, thereby minimizing capital outlays required for each new market entry. Also, in order to continue to implement new enhancements to our trading platforms, new releases of software are generally deployed routinely in all of the applicable markets.\n15\nDisaster Recovery\nWe operate and maintain geographically diverse disaster recovery facilities for all of our markets. We expect that the disaster recovery facilities can be up and running in a short period of time and work with our market participants to ensure that the marketplace can be quickly reopened. We regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests using our back-up data centers, as well as an annual test with our U.S. trading participants. In Canada, as required by local regulations, MATCHNow conducts internal testing of its disaster recovery data processing capabilities at least annually, and it participates in the bi-annual testing coordinated by the IIROC. In Europe, we also regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests which use our back-up data center, as well as an annual test with our European trading participants. We continue to work to improve both the availability of our technology and our disaster recovery facilities.\nRouting and Clearing\nOCC is the sole provider of clearing on all of our options and futures exchanges. National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”), a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTC”), is the sole provider of clearing on our U.S. listed equity exchanges. The Canadian Depository for Securities (“CDS”) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on MATCHNow. BofA Securities, Inc. (“BOA”) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on BIDS Trading. Cboe Europe Equities relies on LCH Limited and LCH SA (“LCH”), EuroCCP, which is described above, and SIX x-clear Ltd (“SIX x-clear”) to clear trades in European listed equity securities as part of an interoperable clearing model.\nCboe Trading is a routing broker-dealer used by our four U.S. equities exchanges and our four U.S. options exchanges, including the electronic platform portion of Cboe Options. Cboe Trading’s clearings firms are Wedbush Securities, Inc. (“Wedbush”) and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”)\n.\nRegulatory Environment and Compliance\nVarious aspects of our business are subject to regulation by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, IIROC, the Ontario Securities Commission (the “OSC”), ESMA, FCA, the Central Bank of the Netherlands (“DNB”), and the AFM and market participants may be subject to regulation by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, National Futures Association (“NFA”), FCA, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, U.S. Department of the Treasury and/or foreign regulators. The following is a discussion of the more significant areas of regulation of us by the SEC, the CFTC, and certain European regulators.\nRecent Developments\nLaws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed to address perceived problems, new products, competition or at the request of market participants. The following is a summary of the general regulatory structure and brief discussion of recent regulatory developments that may significantly impact our business.\nUnited States\nTransaction Fee Pilot\nIn December 2018, the SEC approved a transaction fee pilot in national market system (“NMS”) stocks (the “transaction fee pilot”). The pilot will subject stock exchange transaction fee pricing, including maker-taker fee-and-rebate pricing models, to new temporary pricing restrictions across two test groups, and will require the exchanges to prepare data to be submitted to the SEC. The transaction fee pilot includes a test group that will prohibit rebates and linked pricing, as well as a test group that will impose a cap of $0.0010 for removing or providing displayed liquidity. Once commenced, the transaction fee pilot will last for up to two years with an automatic sunset at one year unless extended by the SEC. On June 16, 2020, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the transaction fee pilot and remanded it back to the SEC for reconsideration.\nThe transaction fee pilot, or a successor pilot, if any, may cause Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or continue to challenge the transaction fee pilot or a successor pilot and it may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, order flow shifts away from exchanges were to occur.\n16\n​\nConsolidated Data Plan Order\nOn May 6, 2020, the SEC issued a final order (the “Consolidated Data Plan Order”) that would require U.S. equities exchanges and FINRA to develop and file a new consolidated data plan (the “Plan”) that would replace the three current U.S. equities tape data plans and require certain governance provisions, such as changes to the voting structure. Pursuant to the Consolidated Data Plan Order, we and the other U.S. equities exchanges and FINRA were required to file the proposed Plan for public comment before the SEC takes any definitive action on such new plan. The proposed Plan was filed on August 11, 2020. Until and if the SEC approves a new plan, the current data plans will continue to govern. The Consolidated Data Plan Order may cause our equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or challenge the Consolidated Data Plan Order and it may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, there is a negative impact on the market data fees our equities exchanges are able to charge. See “Risk Factors” and “Legal Proceedings” for more information.\nFinancial Transaction Taxes\nA number of federal, state and local jurisdictions in the U.S. and EU Member States have considered a financial transaction tax, but many details remain to be discussed and agreed, including how to assess the tax. Implementation of a financial transaction tax could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity, which would have a negative impact on our operations. See “Risk Factors” for more information\n.\nMarket Data Infrastructure Rule\nOn December 9, 2020, the SEC issued a Market Data Infrastructure Final Rule, which makes significant additions to the content available on the Securities Information Processors (“SIPs”) and replaces the exclusive processors with a competing consolidator model. The implementation of the new rules could cause Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or to challenge the new rules and they may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, there are lower SIP plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data. See “Risk Factors” and “Legal Proceedings” for more information.\nEurope\nBrexit\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “UK”) voted to leave the EU in a referendum (the “Brexit Vote”). On January 31, 2020, the UK exited from the EU (“Brexit”) and began a transition period (the “Transition Period”) lasting until December 31, 2020. On December 31, 2020, the Transition Period ended. The EU and UK agreed to a trade deal but it did not cover the entire financial sector. New restrictions on share trading came into force when trading began on January 4, 2021, preventing EU firms from accessing UK venues in European Economic Area (“EEA”)-listed securities. However, this restriction was not imposed in the other direction. As a result, UK firms are permitted to trade EEA listed securities on EU venues. While the EU and UK have committed to agreeing to a framework for co-operation on financial service regulation, there is no assurance that this will lead to improved access to UK venues by EU firms. There is likely to be ongoing uncertainty about the capital markets regulation that will apply to Cboe Europe Equities and its customers for the foreseeable future. For information regarding risks related to Brexit, see “Risk Factors.”\nWithdrawal of Swiss Equivalence and Swiss Counter Measure\nAs a result of an ongoing disagreement between the EU and Switzerland, the European Commission allowed its MiFID equivalence decision for Switzerland to expire at the end of June 2019. As a result, Switzerland made it illegal for venues in the EU, including Cboe Europe, to trade Swiss equities. Consequently, Cboe Europe had to remove these instruments from trading and suffered a loss of trading revenues. However, following Brexit and the end of the Transition Period, UK and Swiss governments were able to reach an agreement to allow the trading of Swiss equities on UK trading venues, including Cboe Europe’s UK exchange. Cboe Europe resumed trading in Swiss equities on February 4, 2021.\n17\nCapital Markets Union\nThe European Council (“E.C.”) has highlighted one of its top priorities as being the establishment of a fully functioning, well-regulated Capital Markets Union (“CMU”). An Action Plan of concrete steps was set out in September 2015, and an update of the list of initiatives was published in September 2016. More recently, the E.C. has set up a High Level Forum on CMU, with the E.C. and European Parliament also seeking to reboot this project. This therefore remains an ongoing project for the E.C., which may result in additional regulation or legislation.\nOTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories\nRegulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (the “European Market Infrastructure Regulation\n” or “\nEMIR”) sets out rules relating to over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets, central counterparties and trade repositories. The rules introduce a reporting obligation for OTC derivatives markets, a clearing obligation for eligible OTC derivatives markets, measures to reduce counterparty credit and operational risk for bilateral OTC derivatives markets, CCPs, and trade repositories, and rules on the establishment of interoperability between CCPs. EMIR was enhanced and amended in June 2019. In addition, regulation governing the authorization and supervision of Central Securities Depositories (“CSDR”) was approved in September 2014, with the publication of most “Level\n2” Regulatory Technical Standards in March 2017, with implementation in March 2019. CSDR may result in the introduction of mandatory buy-ins for OTC business in 2021. In June 2020, European authorities reached a political agreement on a proposed Central Counterparty Recovery and Resolution Regulation (“R&R Regulation”), which may, among other things, increase the amount of prefunded capital EuroCCP is required to maintain. This additional prefunded capital may be required to be drawn before any resolution measures can be taken by the CCP. The final text of the R&R Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on January 22, 2021. As European authorities finalize and potentially adopt level 2 guidance, the final R&R Regulation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nCompliance\nU.S. Securities Industry\nFederal securities laws have established a two-tiered system for the regulation of securities exchanges and market participants. The first tier consists of the SEC, which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws. The second tier consists of self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), which are non-governmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the SEC. The Exchanges are SROs, each registered under Section 6 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) as a “national securities exchange,” and are subject to oversight by the SEC.\nSROs are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors. To be registered as a national securities exchange, an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the SEC prior to beginning operations. Among other things, the SEC must determine that the SRO has the ability to comply with the Exchange Act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange.\nIn general, an exchange SRO is responsible for operating its trading platforms consistent with its rules, and regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members. The rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and, among other things, provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer. Additionally, the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.\nAs registered national securities exchanges, virtually all facets of our Exchange operations are subject to the SEC’s oversight, as prescribed by the Exchange Act. The Exchange Act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities, including record keeping and the day-to-day responsibilities for market operations and broker-dealer oversight. Furthermore, as SROs, the Exchanges are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the SEC or other interested parties. The SEC also has broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses, suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations. For example, in 2013, Cboe Options and C2 and, in 2015, EDGX and EDGA, entered into consent orders with the SEC, under which they\n18\nwere censured, ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the Exchange Act, paid fines and agreed to complete certain undertakings. We have certified to the completion of these undertakings and are no longer required to certify.\nAs part of its regulatory oversight, the SEC conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges, and the Exchanges have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections. To the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes, we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business, which may adversely affect our business. We collect certain fees to cover Section 31 fees charged to the Exchanges by the SEC and certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings. The Exchanges are responsible for the ultimate payment of Section 31 fess to the SEC. Additionally, under the rules of each of our exchanges, as required by the SEC, any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for non-regulatory purposes.\nSection\n19 of the Exchange Act also provides that we must submit to the SEC proposed changes to any of the Exchanges’ rules, including revisions of their certificates of incorporation, bylaws, or other governing documents of the SROs or their parent companies. The SEC will typically publish the proposal for public comment, following which the SEC may approve or disapprove the proposal, as it deems appropriate. Certain categories of rule changes, like fee changes, can be effective on filing, but the SEC retains the ability to suspend or reject such filings within a prescribed period of time.\nCanadian Securities Industry\nMATCHNow is subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by the IIROC, and its primary provincial securities regulatory authority, the OSC. The regulations applicable to MATCHNow cover a wide array of areas, including, but not limited to, marketplace operations (which include corporate governance, fair access, systems compliance and integrity, and conflict management requirements), trading rules, electronic trading risk management, and financial viability.\nFutures and Swaps Industry-CFE and Cboe SEF\nThe operations of each of CFE and Cboe SEF are subject to regulation by the CFTC under the Commodity Exchange Act. The Commodity Exchange Act generally requires that futures trading in the United States be conducted on a designated contract market and, in some cases, requires swaps trading to be conducted on swap execution facility (“SEF”) or designated contract market (“DCM”). The Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded, and for a trading platform to be designated as a swap execution facility on which certain swaps may be traded. Designation as a contract market or swap execution facility for the trading of specified futures or swaps contracts is non-exclusive. This means that the CFTC may permit additional exchanges or trading platforms to be contract markets or swap execution facilities for trading the same or similar contracts.\nCFE is a designated contract market, and Cboe SEF is a swap execution facility, each of which is subject to the oversight of the CFTC and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the Commodity Exchange Act. As a designated contract market, CFE is required to comply with the applicable core principles and regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act, as is Cboe SEF as a swap execution facility. Each of CFE and Cboe SEF has surveillance and regulatory operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance by trading privilege holders with CFE rules, and by participants with Cboe SEF rules, as applicable. If CFE or Cboe SEF fails to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, it may be subject to censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of its business, removal of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of CFE’s designation as a contract market or Cboe SEF’s designation as a swap execution facility.\nEurope\nCboe Europe is located in London and is subject to regulation in the UK and to certain European regulations. The current UK regulatory system was established by the Financial Services Act 2012 (“FSA12”), which amended the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The legislation replaced the previous financial services regulator, the Financial Services Authority, with three new bodies: The Financial Policy Committee (“FPC”), The Prudential Regulation Authority, and the FCA. Financial conduct of markets, including activity on, and the operation of, markets is regulated by the FCA, which is an independent non-governmental body, given statutory powers by the FSA12. The FCA has three statutory objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK\n19\nfinancial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the markets for financial services. The FCA is accountable to Her Majesty’s Treasury Ministers and, through them, to Parliament.\nEuroCCP and Cboe NL are located in Amsterdam and subject to Dutch law and regulation. The current Dutch regulatory system was established by the Act on Financial Supervision. Financial conduct of markets, including activity on, and the operation of, markets is regulated by the AFM. Financial conduct of CCPs, including clearing activity is regulated by the AFM and DNB. The AFM is an independent non-governmental body, given statutory powers by the Act on Financial Supervision. The AFM has three strategic objectives: to promote the fair and conscientious provision of financial services, to promote the fair and efficient operation of the capital markets and to contribute to the stability of the financial system. The AFM is accountable to the Minister of Finance. The DNB is the Dutch central bank, financial sector supervisor and resolution authority. The DNB is committed to a stable financial system: stable prices, solid financial institutions and properly functioning payment transfers.\nMuch of the UK and Dutch financial services regulation originates from the EU. Such regulation includes organizational requirements, capital resources requirements and the specific requirements for RMs and MTFs and are applicable to both Cboe Europe and Cboe NL. MiFID II and MiFIR set out requirements for RMs and MTFs with respect to the establishment of transparent and non-discretionary rules and procedures governing access and for fair and orderly trading and the efficient execution of orders, as well as to facilitate the efficient settlement of transactions conducted on RMs and MTFs and monitoring compliance with the rules. EMIR governs the CCPs operating in the EU and requires them to meet common risk management, governance and capital adequacy standards. The regulatory functions required of Cboe Europe Equities, including EuroCCP, by MiFID II, MiFIR, EMIR and other relevant legislation and regulations are performed by in-house staff. Cboe Europe Equities utilizes the same state-of-the-art, real-time surveillance system is used on the U.S. to monitor trading and market activities on BZX, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX. EuroCCP utilizes proprietary risk management software to monitor settlement and funding flows.\nGlobal FX\nWhile the global institutional spot FX market remains largely unregulated, the enactment of the Dodd Frank Act and its related regulations in the United States and the ongoing implementation of MiFID II and MiFIR in Europe have impacted the regulatory landscape for currency derivative products. For example, certain standardized currency derivative products are required to trade on an organized trading venue such as a SEF or DCM in the United States or on an MTF or organized trading facility in Europe. Moreover, even in the largely unregulated spot FX market, this movement towards additional trading standards and norms is highlighted by the publication of the FX Global Code in 2017 by the Global Foreign Exchange Committee, reflecting principles of good conduct for the wholesale FX market, and whose publication may lead to additional oversight in the global FX market. Cboe FX issued a Statement of Commitment declaring its commitment to conduct its FX market activities in a manner consistent with the principles of the FX Global Code. Following the publication of the FX Global Code regulators are taking a new look at the spot FX market, and any decision to impose new regulations may affect our spot FX business line.\nBroker\n-\nDealer\nCboe Trading and BIDS Trading are registered broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, FINRA, other SROs of which they are members and various state securities regulators. Cboe Trading currently operates as a routing broker-dealer for sending orders from the Exchanges to other venues for execution, including routing orders among the Exchanges. Cboe Trading is considered a facility of each of the Exchanges and is subject to the rules of the Exchanges. The Exchanges are responsible for enforcing Cboe Trading’s compliance with their rules, including to ensure Cboe Trading is not given preferential treatment. BIDS Trading currently operates an ATS, which is designed to bring counterparties together to anonymously trade large blocks of U.S. equities. BIDS Trading is not a member of any of the U.S. national securities exchanges and is not subject to exchange rules.\nCboe Trading and BIDS Trading are subject to SEC and SRO rules, as applicable, and, as registered broker-dealers, regulations concerning all aspects of their businesses, including trading practices, order handling, best execution, anti-money laundering, handling of material non-public information, safeguarding data, reporting, capital adequacy, record retention, market access and the conduct of their officers, employees and other associated persons. The SEC, SROs and state securities commissions may conduct proceedings which can result in injunctions or other sanctions, censures, fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or employees. The SEC and FINRA impose certain minimum capital requirement rules that require notification when a broker-dealer’s net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, dictate the ratio of debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a\n20\nbroker-dealer, constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances and impose certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital.\nIn addition, the ATS operated by BIDS Trading is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof, as such, Cboe intends to maintain the BIDS ATS as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the Exchanges. BIDS Trading Chief Executive Officer, Tim Mahoney, is expected to remain in his current role and lead BIDS Trading as an independent business within Cboe, reporting into an independent committee of the board of Cboe Global Markets. Further, Cboe Trading will not route orders to BIDS Trading on behalf of the Exchanges.\nCboe Global Markets\nCertain aspects of Cboe Global Markets are also subject to SEC, FCA and AFM oversight, including certain ownership and voting restrictions on its stockholders. The focus of the SEC’s regulation of Cboe Global Markets is to assure fair representation of members in the selection of the directors of the Exchanges, public participation in the governance of the Exchanges and that the Exchanges can satisfy their regulatory responsibilities under the Exchange Act. Furthermore, the SEC requires that Cboe Global Markets give due regard to the preservation of the independence of the self-regulatory function of the Exchanges\nand to Cboe Global Markets’ obligations to investors and the general public. The SEC also requires that Cboe Global Markets not take any actions that would interfere with the effectuation of any decisions by the board of directors of any of the Exchanges relating to its regulatory functions or the structure of the market that it regulates or that would interfere with the ability of such Exchange to carry out its responsibilities under the Exchange Act. To the extent that Cboe Global Markets’ business activities involve or relate to the Exchanges, the officers and directors of Cboe Global Markets may be deemed to be officers and directors of the exchanges for purposes of and subject to oversight under the federal securities laws. Accordingly, the SEC may exercise direct supervision and disciplinary authority over certain Cboe Global Markets’ activities and those activities may be subject to SEC approval and, in some cases, public notice and comment.\nIn addition, Cboe Global Markets indirectly holds all of the issued share capital and voting rights in Cboe Europe and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Cboe Chi-X Europe and Cboe NL. As a result, we and any person who holds, or has voting power with respect to, 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Cboe Global Markets common stock may be subject to certain regulatory requirements under UK and Dutch law.\nU.S. Regulatory Responsibilities\nOur U.S.-based exchanges are responsible for assessing the compliance of their TPHs or members, including Cboe Trading, with the respective exchange’s rules and the applicable rules of the SEC and/or CFTC. The main activities that the exchanges, as applicable, are required to monitor for the purpose of compliance with these rules include:\nIn order to ensure market integrity, we regulate and monitor our TPHs’ and members’ trading activities by using both our employees and third parties under regulatory services agreements (“RSAs”). See “Regulatory Agreements” below. Providing effective regulation is important for attracting and retaining the confidence and participation of market-makers, broker-dealers and institutional and retail investors.\nWe expend considerable time, financial resources and effort to ensure that the exchanges’ rules and regulations conform to regulatory best practices within the securities and futures exchange industries and within the regulatory regime overseen by the SEC and CFTC, our primary regulators. In order to support our efforts and those of our market participants to comply with applicable law and our exchange rules, we developed a regulatory program to monitor market activity on our exchanges.\n21\nAll of our Exchanges and CFE are participants in the Intermarket Surveillance Group (“ISG”). ISG is an international information-sharing cooperative governed by a written agreement that provides for a comprehensive surveillance sharing arrangement. In addition to the agreement for confidential information sharing, the ISG provides a framework for the coordination of regulatory efforts among exchanges trading securities, commodity futures and related products to address potential intermarket manipulations and trading abuses.\nAs part of the regulatory program, each of our Exchanges and CFE have rules pertaining to their respective disciplinary processes.\nU.S. Regulatory Agreements\nThe Exchanges and CFE have entered into agreements under which third parties have agreed to perform regulatory functions on behalf of our markets, (e.g., RSAs). As discussed below, in addition, in certain other instances for our Exchanges, a third party has been allocated the regulatory responsibility under Rule 17d-1 or Rule 17d-2 under the Exchange Act, while in others, we retain the regulatory responsibility for the activities.\nRegulatory Services Agreement with FINRA\nThe Exchanges have entered into agreements with FINRA under which FINRA has agreed to provide regulatory services to the Exchanges. Under these agreements, FINRA performs certain regulatory functions on behalf of the Exchanges and, to avoid any potential conflicts of interest concerning the regulation and oversight of Cboe Trading, certain regulatory services specific to Cboe Trading. The Exchanges remain responsible for the regulation of their TPHs, members and marketplaces, and retain the authority for bringing disciplinary actions against their TPHs and members, although FINRA performs various disciplinary-related functions on behalf of the Exchanges. Over the course of 2019 through 2021 certain regulatory and disciplinary-related functions that FINRA had performed on behalf of the Exchanges have been, or are in the process of being, moved back in-house from FINRA.\nRegulatory Services Agreements with NFA and OCC\nThrough December 31, 2020, the NFA performed regulatory functions on behalf of CFE pursuant to an RSA with CFE. Starting January 1, 2021, these regulatory functions were moved in-house from the NFA. In addition, OCC has also performed and continues to perform certain regulatory functions on behalf of CFE pursuant to an RSA with CFE. CFE also performs other regulatory and disciplinary-related functions in-house. Whether performed under an RSA or in-house, CFE retains overall responsibility for the regulation of its marketplace and for bringing disciplinary actions. CFE is also a party to cooperative and regulatory information sharing agreements with other SROs and is a member of the ISG, described above.\nRule 17d-1 Designations and Rule 17d-2 Agreements\nSection 17(d) of the Exchange Act and the related Exchange Act rules permit SROs to allocate certain regulatory responsibilities to avoid duplicative oversight and regulation. Under Exchange Act Rule\n17d-1, the SEC designates one SRO to be the designated examining authority (“DEA”) for each broker-dealer that is a member of more than one SRO. The DEA is responsible for the regulatory oversight of the Exchange Act’s financial responsibility rules pertaining to that broker-dealer. Cboe Options is the DEA for several of its TPHs. Cboe Trading’s assigned DEA is FINRA.\nExchange Act Rule 17d-2 permits SROs to enter into agreements, commonly called Rule 17d-2 agreements, which are approved by the SEC and concern the enforcement of rules applicable to all of those SROs and relating to TPHs and members those SROs have in common. The Exchanges have entered into certain bi-lateral Rule 17d-2 agreements under which FINRA is allocated responsibility for enforcing certain federal securities laws and certain Exchange rules that are common with FINRA rules. The Exchanges have entered into certain other multi-party Rule 17d-2 agreements that allocate responsibility among the participating SROs, which may include the Exchanges, for ensuring that their allocated common members comply with certain rules governing, among other items, options related sales practices, options related market surveillance, insider trading, NMS and consolidated audit trail NMS plan (“CAT”) compliance.\nNational Market System Plans\nWe are member participants of several NMS plans including, but not limited to, the following: Cboe Options, C2, BZX, and EDGX are member exchanges in OPRA, which is the designated securities information processor for market information that is generated through the trading of exchange-listed securities options in the United States, and it\n22\ndisseminates certain core trading information, such as last sale reports and quotations. Cboe Options, BZX, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX also participate in the CTA and the UTP, which perform analogous services for the U.S. equities market. Securities Information Automation Corporation (“SIAC”) acts as the “processor” for OPRA and the CTA/QC Plans. Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC acts as the processor for the Nasdaq Unlisted Trading Privileges Plan.\nCboe Options, C2, BZX, and EDGX are also parties to the Options Order Protection and Locked/Crossed Market Plan, which is designed to prohibit trade-throughs and avoid locked/crossed markets. Cboe Options, C2, BZX, and EDGX are also parties to the Options Listing Procedures Plan, which sets forth the procedures that the options exchanges must follow to list new options. Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX are also parties to the NMS plan for the selection and reservation of securities symbols.\nUnder the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority Plan (“ORSA Plan”), U.S. securities options exchanges are permitted to act jointly in the administration, operation and maintenance of a regulatory system for the surveillance, investigation and detection of the unlawful use of undisclosed, material information in trading in one or more of their markets. The ORSA Plan is intended to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency with which the exchanges regulate their respective markets and to avoid duplication of certain regulatory efforts. FINRA operates the ORSA Plan facility.\nThe CAT involves the creation of a comprehensive audit trail that strives to enhance regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in the U.S. securities markets through a phased implementation. Upon final implementation of the provisions of the CAT, data will be required to be reported to a central repository the following day by each SRO (a “Plan Participant”) and broker-dealer (an “Industry Member”). On November 15, 2016, the SEC approved the CAT. The first of various phases of CAT were originally required to begin in November 2017; however, there have been some delays. In 2017, Thesys CAT LLC (“Thesys”), a subsidiary of Thesys Technologies, LLC, was selected as the plan processor with the responsibility to build and operate the CAT. The first phase of CAT ultimately went live in November 2018, at which time we and other SROs/Plan Participants began initial reporting to the CAT. In 2019, Thesys was replaced by a new plan processor, FINRA CAT, LLC, a subsidiary of FINRA. The second phase for Industry Member order and trade file submissions is now live and began in June 2020 (for equities) and July 2020 (for options), with additional sub-phases related to order and trade file submissions carrying through December 2021 (or by subsequent dates in the event the current deadlines are extended). The final implementation sub-phase, related to broker-dealer customer and account information submissions by Industry Members, is now scheduled to go live in July 2022 (or by a subsequent date in the event the current deadline is extended). While the funding of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both the SROs/Plan Participants (which includes our securities exchanges) and Industry Members, until fee filings associated with the funding model are effective with or approved by the SEC, the funding to date has solely been provided by the SROs/Plan Participants. The funding by the SROs/Plan Participants has been done in exchange for promissory notes expected to be repaid once such Industry Member fees are collected. Until those fees are collected, the SROs/Plan Participants may continue to incur additional significant costs, including as a result of replacing the plan processor, or result in the uncollectibility of promissory notes related to the funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT. See Note 9 (“Credit Losses”) and Note 10 (“Other Assets, Net”) for further information. In addition, on February 14, 2021, Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC, formed by SRO Plan Participants to implement the CAT requirements, filed motions to stay all or portions of two exemptive orders the SEC issued on December 16, 2020 related to the implementation of the CAT. On February 16, 2021, Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC also petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for judicial review of the two exemptive orders, asserting that the orders are unlawful.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own or have rights to a number of intellectual property assets, including trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents. While the majority of our intellectual property is protected under U.S. law, we have many intellectual property assets protected by laws in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world. We license some intellectual property assets to other entities. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, while respecting the legitimate intellectual property rights of others.\nHuman Capital Management\nCboe has a robust human capital management program in place focused on equal opportunities, performance and career development, health and well-being, comprehensive benefits, training and succession planning. Additional information on our approach to human capital and ESG issues can be found in the Cboe Global Markets, Inc. Environmental, Social and Governance Report located in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website at https://markets.cboe.com/about/corporate-social-responsibility, which does not form a part of this Form 10-K.\n23\nEqual Opportunity, Diversity, and Pay Equity\nCboe believes in a culture of diversity and inclusion that promotes creativity, collaboration and innovation, which is critical to the success of our business and defining the markets of tomorrow. Cboe is an equal opportunity employer and provides equal employment opportunities to all qualified persons without regard to sex, race, color, ethnicity, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, veteran or military status, disability, marital status, domestic partnership or civil union status, pregnancy, sexual orientation, genetic status, gender identity or expression, and any other characteristic protected by law (a “Protected Characteristic”). Cboe is committed to applying our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy to all employment practices that impact the terms and conditions of employment including, but not limited to, hiring, evaluation, discipline, promotion, training, compensation, transfer, and termination. Actively nurturing and maintaining a diverse and inclusive culture at Cboe is a core imperative. We believe that our collective and unique perspectives fuel our capabilities, enhance our team spirit and enable us to attract and retain top talent as we define the markets of the future. Our commitment and responsibility in this regard starts at the top, with full Cboe Board of Directors and executive team support.\nOne of the most compelling examples of our pledge to equality, diversity and inclusion throughout our company is the completion of our first pay equity study in 2019. In 2020, we finalized the implementation of the findings of our inaugural study. To maintain and strengthen our efforts in this area, we also review the critical touchpoints across the employee journey with Cboe to keep a level playing field, from the talent selection, promotion, leadership development and succession planning processes and make adjustments, as necessary, to ensure opportunity parity across the company. Our goal is to ensure that equal pay and equal opportunity for all that results in a collaborative, high performing organization bringing new innovations to market and providing superior service to our customers.\nThe Cboe Women’s Initiative was launched in November 2019 and includes more than 70 women working toward its mission: to increase representation, strengthen voices, and build a culture of opportunity and advancement for the women of Cboe. The Women’s Initiative is led by a group of senior-level Cboe women, has broad representation across Cboe’s global footprint and enjoys the support of Cboe’s management and Human Resources. More specifically, the Women’s Initiative is comprised of four committees that target areas where its membership strives to promote change, such as networking, enhancing recruitment and retention, highlighting benefits and resources for women at Cboe, and building a formal mentorship program at Cboe. In addition, there were several networking opportunities throughout the year for the women of Cboe. These events included the inaugural “Women Trailblazers” events where senior women share their success stories through personal accounts of career growth and impact. In March of 2020, we also celebrated International Women’s Day globally with several fireside chat events with Cboe Board of Directors members.\nWe are also proud to share that Cboe recently formed an employee Diversity Leadership Council in 2020 focused on unlocking the potential of a variety of perspectives, capabilities and cultural experiences. We believe in a culture of diversity and inclusion that promotes creativity, collaboration and innovation, which is critical to the success of our business and defining the markets of tomorrow. To reinforce this belief, this council is a collective voice on how Cboe strives to create a diverse workforce that reflects the world in which we operate. Further, they are charged with oversight on how we build an inclusive culture where every employee feels welcome, safe and empowered.\nTo reinforce our commitment to organizational wide education and commitment to diversity and inclusion we provided a full-day Unconscious Bias training through third-party experts for all managers around the globe in 2020 with the commitment to continue the rollout of this program for all employees.\nPerformance and Career Development\nCboe expects employees to perform their duties to the best of their ability and to develop their competencies for career growth. We recognize the need to provide ongoing, timely, and constructive performance feedback. Cboe has designed a Performance Management Program that drives the professional development of our employees while also providing fair and equitable rewards and recognition. The principles of performance management include:\n24\nWe continued to strengthen our talent management processes in 2020 by instituting career conversations that were enabled through specially designed toolkits for both employees and managers to support regular, valuable conversations focused on improvement, development and retention.\nEmployee Health and Well-Being and Comprehensive Benefits Program\nCboe’s vision is to support the overall wellness of employees and their families through education and activities that encourage a healthy lifestyle, resulting in improved health and productivity. Our programs and benefit plans provide a corporate atmosphere of collective well-being that incorporate strategies for physical, emotional, mental and financial wellness. Our programs focused on enhanced employee assistance programs, wellness programs and challenges, that include both mental and physical wellbeing, and webinars and classes through our retirement vendor to support the financial health of our employees.\nTo further these efforts, we launched the CboeFit program that creates an opportunity to elevate these programs and strengthen employee engagement as we execute against our wellness vision and strategies. With the global pandemic in 2020, there was further focus on our Employee Assistance program that was strengthened across the globe with a diverse set of mental health resources aimed at supporting our employees during a unique and challenging time.\nEmployee Engagement and Pulse Surveys, Town Halls and an Open-Door Policy\nIn 2020, Cboe conducted our third annual employee engagement survey and has implemented career, leadership, and culture focused programs in response to the survey findings. Our participation rate exceeds standard benchmarks and a significant majority of our employees would recommend Cboe as a great place to work. To further cement our commitment to Diversity and Inclusion, we added new, enhanced questions in this area. Our Diversity Leadership Council hosted a special focus group to review these specific results to listen to the voices of our diverse population, prioritize their feedback and ideas, and create commitments for actionable improvements.\nOur senior management team continues to hold the commitment to an open-door policy and encourages the free flow of information and communication in furtherance of active transparency. With the 2020 pandemic, our ability to tap into the voice of our employees was critically important. We conducted regular pulse surveys to gauge sentiment in making critical decisions. Our CEO also issues weekly letters to help connect with our employees. Human Resources also provided ongoing regular resources and tips to help support the variety of challenges from the new reality of fully remote work to childcare and elder care that our employees faced throughout 2020.\nCboe also continues to create an open and frank atmosphere in which any grievance, complaint, suggestion or question receives a timely response. Cboe offers a whistleblower hotline for complaints, which can be made anonymously. Additionally, employees can raise questions and suggestions to the Cboe Human Resources team either in-person or via a group email address and are either responded to individually or addressed at our Global Town Hall meetings. The objective of these town halls is to provide employees an update on company news, share updates from major business lines, as well as provide a forum to ask questions and offer feedback. Town halls can include updates on anything from legislation that may impact our business to ESG topics. Employees are encouraged to participate in free flow of information and communication and to offer positive and constructive feedback in furtherance of active transparency.\nTraining and Succession Planning\nThe development of all employees at Cboe is vitally important to our collective success. Through skill and competency development we signal our investment in all while also enabling enhanced productivity. Through our tuition reimbursement program, our employees receive financial support in their pursuit of specialized university courses and degrees. In addition to our ongoing offering of online courses on diverse topics through our corporate university, CboeU, we also provided new learning programs in 2020. We also have employees participate in the newly launched CboeLearns hybrid program focused on virtual classroom instruction combined with work application. Additionally, we had employees participate in another new program, CboeLive, focused on business topics to foster organizational-wide knowledge sharing and education.\nLeadership is another critical element to our success at Cboe. People managers globally participated in a two-day training focused on the “4 Essential Roles of Leadership” (1. Inspire Trust; 2. Create Vision; 3. Execute Strategy; 4. Coach\n25\nPotential). We expanded on our leadership training through the design and launch of a bespoke 8-week program, CboeLeads, expanding on the development of our high potential leaders further strengthening the leadership bench and accelerating readiness of this key talent pool. The senior management team participated in an additional one-day workshop focused on their roles that was also accompanied by Leadership toolkits to guide an enhanced approach to coaching and career conversations.\nCboe has held several succession planning discussions with the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors to plan for the fulfillment of essential roles, such as the CEO and other senior officers. This process includes investments in advanced development planning for targeted successors to accelerate their readiness through key internal projects and assignments as well as tailored training. Diversity and inclusion are a formal part of Cboe's succession planning process as we work to identify and advance internal diverse talent and, in parallel, continually scan external talent pools for successors.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2020, we employed 1,010 individuals, 786 of whom are based in the United States, 113 of whom are located in London, 7 of whom are located in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 12 of whom are located in Ecuador, 6 of whom are located in Ontario, Canada, 15 of whom are located in Calgary, Alberta, 65 of whom are located in the Amsterdam, 1 of whom is located in Hong Kong, 3 of whom are located in Singapore, and 2 of whom are located in Switzerland.

    "text": "The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we believe are material at this time relating to our business. These risks and uncertainties, however, are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us. Any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the key risks and uncertainties described below that we believe are material to us at this time:\n​\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by the effects of COVID-19, however, the extent to which our results could be affected by COVID-19 largely depends on future developments which are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. Governments, public institutions, and other organizations around the world have taken, and may take additional, emergency measures to combat its spread, including rollouts of vaccinations, implementation of travel\n29\nbans and closures of offices, factories, schools, public buildings and businesses. These measures may interfere with the ability of our employees, vendors, technology equipment suppliers, data and disaster recovery centers, and other service providers to perform their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business. In particular, between March 13, 2020 and June 14, 2020, we temporarily suspended open outcry trading in response to COVID-19. In addition to uncertain expenses we may incur due to COVID-19 as part of us providing a safe and healthy work and trading environment, employees working remotely from different locations and in connection with our eventual return to our offices, we may also be subject to claims from employees or customers alleging failure to maintain safe premises and restrictions with respect to protocols relating to COVID-19. Further, changes in trading behavior, impacts to trading behavior due to the temporary suspension of open outcry trading, market disruptions, additional temporary suspensions of open outcry trading, temporary regulatory measures and other future developments caused by the effects of COVID-19, including a re-occurrence of cases, could impact trading volumes and the demand for our products, market data and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and could heighten many of the other risks described below.\nLoss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the S&P\n500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index, as well as others, granted to us by the owners of such indices, and additionally hold exclusive rights to our proprietary VIX methodology that provides the basis for the creation of VIX options and futures. In 2020, approximately 58.0% of our net transaction and clearing fees (defined below) were generated by futures and index options, the overwhelming majority of which were generated by our exclusively-licensed products (e.g., SPX options) and products based on our proprietary VIX methodology (e.g., VIX options and futures). The bulk of this revenue is attributable to our SPX options and VIX options and futures. As a result, our revenues less cost of revenues are dependent in large part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products and our ability to maintain our exclusive proprietary rights in the VIX methodology and related products and indices.\nThere is a risk, with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses, that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all. In the first event, we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an index product traded by us on an exclusive basis, which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability. In the second event, we could lose the right to list the index product entirely. The loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses, especially for the S&P 500 Index, for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nIn addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses, if we are unable to retain exclusive proprietary rights in the VIX methodology and related products and indices, our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe EU has adopted legislation affecting providers and users of benchmark indices in the EU MiFIR requires benchmarks used to value a financial instrument in the EU to be made available on a non-discriminatory basis to all EU trading venues and central counterparty clearing houses for the purposes of trading and clearing. As a result, owners of such benchmarks must provide licenses on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. While similar legislation to MiFIR has not been proposed in the U.S., if it were passed, it could cause us to lose our exclusive rights to list and trade internally developed and licensed index products. Further, in 2018, the EU implemented the EU Benchmark Regulation, which regulates users, data providers and calculators of benchmarks (“administrators”) in the EU, and among other things, prohibits use of benchmarks in connection with a financial instrument unless the administrator is deemed to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime and the benchmark is registered in an EU member state. These regulations and other emerging regulatory regimes around the world may impact international customers’ interest in or ability to trade index-based products listed on our U.S. exchanges, as well as impact our expansion activities to establish foreign trading of our index-based products and our ability to license proprietary indices for use outside of the U.S.\nFurthermore, our competitors may succeed in developing, offering and providing a market for the trading of index-based or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer and they may become successful and take away volume from our products. It is also possible that a third party may offer trading in index-based products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses, but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license.\nThe value of our licenses to exclusively list securities index options and futures also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options and futures based on their indices. Although we and the\n30\nindex owners have prevailed in legal actions challenging our rights to exclusively license indices, we may be subject to changes in the law or other actions taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively offer trading in certain index options and futures.\nGeneral economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business.\nThe volume of trading and clearing transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic, political and market conditions in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control, including:\nAny of these factors, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reducing trading and clearing volumes and demand for market data.\nOur business may be adversely affected by price competition.\nThe securities industry is characterized by intense price competition, especially with respect to transaction fees. We may be required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by new or existing competitors, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. We also compete with respect to the pricing of market data and value-added market data, such as historical market data.\nIn our options segment, the pricing model for trade execution has changed in response to competitive market conditions, and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly, including by opening new exchanges, which allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants. These changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us, especially on transaction fees and incentives for multi-listed products. As a result of these pricing pressures, our average rate per multi-listed options contract may decrease. It is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets.\nIn addition, one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume. Some order-providing firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them.\n31\nWith respect to our proprietary products, we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial market participants that offer over-the-counter derivatives. We also compete against certain multi-listed options products, including SPY, which offer some of the features of our proprietary products.\nTo attract market share, we may offer “inverted” pricing specials or no-transaction fee trading from time to time. BZX also offers a “cross-asset add volume tier” that gives a bigger rebate for additional volume on both the BZX equities and options platforms. Similarly, EDGX offers a “cross-asset tier” that gives a reduced fee for volume on both the EDGX equities and options platforms. These forms of promotions may adversely affect our profitability.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of our services and products, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner. Also, our profits could decline if competitive pressures or regulatory changes force us to reduce fees.\nA significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transaction and clearing-based business. If the amount of trading volume on our markets or clearing volume decreases, or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products, our revenues from transaction and clearing fees will most likely decrease.\nIn 2020, approximately 63.2% of our revenues less cost of revenues were generated by our transaction and clearing-based business. This business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow, both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers. If the amount of trading volume on our Exchanges, CFE, and MATCHNow, notional value traded on Cboe FX, Cboe SEF and Cboe Europe Equities exchanges or clearing volumes at EuroCCP decreases, we are likely to see a decrease in fees.\nOur total trading or clearing volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading or clearing activity for any reason, such as:\nOver the past few years, a number of legislative actions have been taken, both domestically and internationally, that may cause market participants to be subject to increased capital requirements and additional compliance burdens. These actions, including the Collins Amendment to Dodd-Frank, MiFID II and MiFIR, may cause market participants to reduce trading activity on our Exchanges.\nIn addition, the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors, including the type of customer and certain volume discounts. If the amount of our trading volume decreases, the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products, our revenues from transaction fees will most likely decrease. We can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease.\nRevenues from our market data fees and access and capacity fees may be reduced due to declines in our market share, trading volumes or regulatory changes.\nThe occurrence of any event that reduces the amount of market data fees that we receive, whether as a result of fee reductions, fewer members subscribing to the U.S. tape plans, declines in market share or trading volumes (or notional volume in the case of Cboe Europe Equities) or regulatory changes will have a direct negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. For example, if our market share of U.S. listed equities and options, or Cboe’s European equities trading, were to decline, our share of market data fees could also decline. Moreover, market data fees could decline as a result of a reduction in the numbers of market data users, for example because of consolidation among market data subscribers or due to a decline in professional subscriptions as a result of staff reductions in the financial services industry or otherwise.\n32\nRegulatory and legal developments could also impact the fees we receive from market data and access and capacity, or our cost in providing such services. In the U.S., we are generally required to file with the SEC any changes to the fees that we charge for our securities market data products and access and capacity fees. In recent years, certain industry groups have objected to the ability of exchanges to charge for certain market data products. In addition, the SEC and some media have scrutinized market data and market access. As discussed above, the implementation of the new Market Data Infrastructure rules could cause Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or to challenge the new rules and they may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, there are lower SIP plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data. See “Legal Proceedings” for more information.\nIn addition, as discussed above, the SEC issued a final Consolidated Data Plan Order that would require U.S. equities exchanges and FINRA to develop and file a new consolidated data plan. If the Consolidated Data Plan Order were to be implemented, it may have a negative impact on the market data fees we charge and there could be a negative impact on our revenues. See “Legal Proceedings” for more information.\nWe believe Cboe Europe Equities currently offers market data to customers on a non-discriminatory basis at a reasonable cost. As European regulators determine how market data should be disaggregated and what is a reasonable commercial basis for providing market data, it could affect our ability to offer market data products in the same manner that we do today thereby causing an adverse effect on our European market data revenues. While MiFID II and MiFIR aim to encourage a commercial solution to a consolidated tape in Europe, should this fail to materialize, policy makers might be encouraged to implement a mandatory solution that could impact our ability to develop our own commercial offering.\nThe technology upon which we rely, including those of our service providers, may be vulnerable to security risks, cybersecurity risks, insider threats, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, operational disruptions, and other risks and events that could harm our business.\nThe secure and reliable operation of our technology, including our computer systems and communications networks, and those of our service providers and market participants, is a critical element of our operations. These systems and networks may be subject to various cybersecurity incidents, improper or inadvertent access to or disclosure of confidential, commercially sensitive, or personally identifiable information, data theft, corruption or destruction, cyber-attack, malware and other security problems, as well as acts of terrorism, natural disasters, human error, criminal insider activity, power loss and other events that are beyond our control. As previously disclosed, in 2018, we discovered and initiated an investigation of an internal theft of idled and deactivated computer servers and networking devices. We subsequently resolved the incident by, including, among other actions, terminating the employment of the responsible individual, reporting the matter to regulators and law enforcement, and improving our policies, procedures and controls over the physical security and protection of our computer systems and communications networks to help minimize the risk of reoccurrence.\nWe currently maintain policies, procedures and controls designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and reliability of our systems, networks and information more broadly, and to guard against cybersecurity incidents and unauthorized access. These policies, procedures and controls are subject to periodic monitoring, auditing, and evaluation practices, pursuant to our enterprise risk management program. Further, we developed and maintain cybersecurity and data privacy training programs for our employees and our third-party consultants who have access to our systems, which includes simulations, tabletop exercises, and response readiness tests. Independent third-party cybersecurity penetration assessments are also routinely performed. Collectively, these safeguards and measures may prove inadequate to prevent the attendant risk posed by cybersecurity incidents, subjecting us to contractual restrictions, liability and damages, loss of business, penalties, unfavorable publicity, and increased scrutiny by our regulators, and materially impacting our financial condition and operating results. We may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security or system failures, including to protect against threatened breaches, to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach, and to address any reputational harm or litigation or regulatory liability. Such harms also could cause us to lose market participants, experience lower trading volume, and negatively impact our competitive advantage and business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, as threats continue to evolve and increase, and as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n33\nIntense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance.\nThe market for trade execution services, clearing and products is intensely competitive in the asset classes and geographies in which we operate. Increased competition may result in a decline in our share of trading activity and a decline in our revenues from transaction and clearing fees and market data fees, thereby materially adversely affecting our operating results. We compete with a number of entities on several different fronts, including the cost, quality and speed of our trade execution, functionality and ease of use of our trading and clearing platforms, range of our products and services, our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation. See “Business – Competition” for more information.\nSome of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, technological, personnel and other resources than we do. These factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products, to offer lower transaction and clearing fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can. In addition, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected if we cannot successfully develop, introduce and/or market new services and products or if we need to adopt costly and customized technology for our services and products.\nFurthermore, new or existing competitors may:\nIf our products, markets, services and technology are not competitive or we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology, customer preferences and regulatory requirements or any significant delays in product development efforts our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe depend on third-party service providers for certain services that are important to our business. An interruption, significant increase in fees or cessation or impairment of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on a number of service providers, including clearing organizations such as OCC, NSCC, DTC, CDS, LCH, EuroCCP, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and SIX x-clear; securities information processors such as the CTA, UTP Securities Information Processor and OPRA; regulatory and other service providers such as FINRA and OCC; the hosts of our data and disaster recovery centers; and various vendors of communications and networking products and services. In addition, we also depend on third party routing and clearing firms that are involved in processing transactions on our behalf. More specifically:\n34\nWith respect to options, all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of OCC. At December 31, 2020, there were 97 TPHs that are clearing members of OCC. Two clearing members accounted for approximately 62.9% of transaction and other fees collected through OCC in 2020. The next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 18.0% of transaction and other fees collected through OCC. Additionally, the two largest clearing members clear the majority of the market-maker sides of transactions at Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX and at all of the options exchanges. Should one of these clearing members or liquidity providers exit the business or withdraw from our options exchanges, impose additional market-maker financial requirements or if market-makers were unable to transfer to another clearing member or other liquidity providers were unable to provide additional liquidity, this could create a significant disruption to the options markets, including ours.\nWe cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs. An interruption or malfunction in or the cessation or impairment of an important service by a third party or disruption of a third party’s operations could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services, make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business, cause us to experience the loss of a significant number of market participants or cause us to experience a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our inability to make alternative arrangements, such as moving clearing to another clearing agency, in a timely manner, or at all, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. expose us to currency risk.\nIn addition to our operations in the U.S., we have operations in the UK, continental Europe, Canada, Ecuador, Hong Kong and Singapore. We, therefore, have exposure to exchange rate movements between the British pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, and the Singapore dollar against the U.S. dollar. Significant inflation or changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to one or more of these currencies could occur as a result of general economic or political conditions, acts of war or terrorism, changes in governmental monetary or tax policy, Brexit or changes in local interest rates. These exchange rate differences will affect the translation of our non-U.S. results of operations and financial condition into U.S. dollars as part of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe and our licensors may not be able to protect our respective intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, proprietary products, index methodologies and other proprietary rights. In addition, we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusively-licensed index options and futures products. We and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying, or otherwise obtaining and using, our intellectual property without authorization, listing our proprietary or exclusively-licensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights. We and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of\n35\nothers or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. We and our licensors may not be successful in this regard. Such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us, diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience and continued efforts of management and other key personnel. As a result, to be successful, we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees. However, we have no assurances that these employees will remain with us. The roles and responsibilities of departing executive officers and employees will need to be filled either by existing or new officers and employees, which may require us to devote time and resources to identifying, hiring and integrating replacements for the departed executives and employees that could otherwise be used to pursue business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, financial condition and operating results.\nThere is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel in the technology space, which may make it difficult for us to retain and recruit qualified employees in sufficient numbers. If we fail to retain our current employees, it would be difficult and costly to identify, recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business. In particular, failure to retain and attract qualified technology personnel could result in systems failures. Consequently, our reputation may be harmed, we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and motivate our employees in the same manner as we\nhave historically done.\nAdditionally, effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our management team and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nOur clearinghouse operations expose us to associated risks, including credit, liquidity, market and other risks related to the defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties.\n​\nWe are subject to risks related to operating our clearinghouse, EuroCCP, including the\nrisks of failing to meet strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight, risks of default by clearing participants and counterparties, due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons, and the risks associated with the adequacy of participants’ margin and default funds. These risks\ncould subject our business to substantial losses, reputational harm, regulatory consequences, including litigation, fines and enforcement actions, and the inability to operate our business, including the continued development of the European derivatives buildout.\n​\nTo mitigate the credit risks related to defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties, including the market risk that we would only be able to close out a defaulting participant’s positions at a loss, there are minimum participation criteria to become a clearing participant and clearing participants are required to provide collateral to cover the margin requirement and default fund contributions. No guarantee can be given that the collateral provided will at all times be sufficient or provide absolute assurance against us experiencing financial losses from defaults by the participants or counterparties on their obligations. In addition, although such collateral is preferably held in European central banks and central securities depositories, there are occasions where commercial banks are used, which can expose us to risk of default by those banks. In addition, EuroCCP entered into a\n€\n1.5 billion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility that is available to be drawn by EuroCCP towards (a) financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through EuroCCP’s clearing system and (b) financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of EuroCCP incurred in the operation of its clearing system, however we can give no assurance that this facility will be sufficient to meet all such obligations or sufficiently mitigate EuroCCP’s liquidity risk to meet its payment obligations when due. Substantial amounts of the collateral, and any amounts drawn under this facility, may be at risk if a clearing participant defaults on its obligations to our clearinghouse and its margin and default fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations. This facility is expected to terminate on July 1, 2021 and we may not be able to enter into a replacement facility on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We cannot assure you that the mitigating measures, policies, safeguards and risk management procedures will be sufficient to detect problems or to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.\n36\nComputer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur business depends on the integrity and performance of our computer and communications systems. If our systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services. These consequences could result in trading outages, lower trading and clearing volumes, financial losses, decreased customer service and satisfaction and regulatory sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. Although we have a back-up plan of significant trading and key corporate systems, the back-up systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cyber-security breach. Despite having disaster recovery facilities, there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient, transparent and liquid marketplace, if we can open at all, following a systems failure. Moreover, with extended trading hours, we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer non-trading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely.\nOur markets and clearinghouse have experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and in the future our systems may fail, in whole or in part, or may operate slowly, causing one or more of the following:\nAny of these events may cause:\nAs a consequence of any of these events, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially.\nIn addition to other measures, we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading and clearing activity or times of unusual market volatility. However, we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading or clearing volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading or clearing volume without failure or degradation of performance.\nWe anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware, software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic. If we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate increasing trading or clearing activity and to execute our business strategy, our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be materially adversely affected.\nOur use of open source software code may subject our software to general release or require us to re\n-\nengineer our software, which could harm our business.\nOur technology platform uses open source software code. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. In addition, some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Open source license terms may be ambiguous, and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated. We believe that our use of open source software is in compliance with the relevant open source software licenses and does not require disclosure of any of our source code. However, if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source\n37\ncode, re-engineer or discontinue use of our software or take other remedial action any or all of which could cause disruptions in, or impose significant costs on, our business.\nDamage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe believe one of our competitive strengths is our strong industry reputation. Various issues may give rise to reputational risk, including issues relating to:\nDamage to our reputation could cause a reduction in the trading volume of our proprietary products or on our markets or cause us to lose customers. This, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFinancial or other problems experienced by third parties could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, clearing agents and counterparties. For example, we are exposed to credit risk for transaction fees we bill to customers on a monthly basis in arrears. Our customers and other third parties may default on their obligations to us due to a lack of liquidity, operational failure, bankruptcy or other reasons. For additional credit risks related to our clearinghouse operations, see the Risk Factor “Our clearinghouse operations expose us to associated risks, including credit, liquidity, market and other risks related to the defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties.”\nIn addition, with respect to orders Cboe Trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers, Cboe Trading is exposed to counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our routing and clearing firms that are involved in processing equities and options transactions on our behalf, as well as failure on the part of such brokers to pass back any transactional rebates. Wedbush and Morgan Stanley guarantee equity trades until one day after the trade date, after which time NSCC provides a guarantee. Thus, Cboe Trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to an equity trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that Wedbush or Morgan Stanley fails to perform. With respect to U.S. listed equity options and futures, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the OCC, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and CFE and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades. With respect to Canadian equities, we deliver reports of matched trades of our customers to the CDS, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on MATCHNow and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched Canadian equities trades.\nWith respect to routed U.S. equity transactions, Cboe Trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to Wedbush and Morgan Stanley related to clearing until the day following the trade date. Cboe Trading uses Wedbush to clear trades routed through affiliates of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC as well as for trades routed directly to other exchanges and optionally dark pools. Morgan Stanley clears trades routed through the Morgan Stanley routing brokers and also clears executions routed to most dark pools. Cboe Trading maintains counterparty credit risk exposure from routing\n38\nbrokers with respect to rebates earned until completion of the routing brokers next invoice cycle following the execution. Additionally, BIDS Trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to BOA related to clearing until the day following the trade date.\nWith respect to U.S. listed equity and exchange traded product options, Cboe Trading is subject to counterparty credit risk exposure with respect to rebates earned from routing brokers until completion of the routing brokers’ next invoice cycle has completed for an execution.\nOur exposure to credit risk may be further impacted by volatile securities markets that may affect the ability of our customers, counterparties and other third parties to satisfy their obligations to us. Moreover, we may not be successful in managing our credit risk through mitigating measures, policies, safeguards and risk management procedures, reporting and control procedures or by maintaining credit standards. Any losses arising from such defaults or other credit losses could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWhile neither Cboe FX nor Cboe SEF has direct counterparty risk, Cboe FX or Cboe SEF may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event. Therefore, Cboe FX and Cboe SEF may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade spot FX on the Cboe FX platform, or NDFs on Cboe SEF.\nWe may be required to assume ownership of a position in securities in connection with our order routing service, which could subject us to trading losses when our broker-dealer disposes of that position.\nWe offer a smart-order routing service through our broker-dealer subsidiary, Cboe Trading, which provides its customers with access to other market centers when we route their orders to those market centers for execution. In connection with this service, we may assume ownership of a position in securities. This may occur, for example, when a market center to which we have routed a customer’s order experiences systemic issues and is unable to determine the status of that order. When this happens, we may make a business decision to provide a cancellation notice to our customer, relieving our customer of any liability with respect to the order. We may be informed later, however, that the order was executed at the market center to which we routed it, in which case Cboe Trading would be required to take ownership of that securities position. Our third party clearing brokers maintain error accounts on behalf of Cboe Trading into which such positions settle, and we require the respective clearing broker to trade out of those positions as expeditiously as possible, which could result in our incurring trading losses.\nWe may not effectively manage our growth, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe expect that our business will continue to grow, which may place a significant strain on our management, personnel, systems and resources. We must continually improve our operational, financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures, and may need to continue to expand, train and manage our workforce. We must also maintain close coordination among our technology, legal, accounting, finance, marketing, sales, regulatory and compliance functions. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed. Furthermore, failure to successfully expand into new asset classes or new geographies may materially adversely affect our growth strategy and our future profitability.\nOur continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology, facilities, personnel, and financial and management systems and controls. It also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations, and we will need to integrate, train and manage a growing employee base. The expansion of our existing businesses, any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes, which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required. We may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary. Further, unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\n39\nWe selectively explore acquisition opportunities and strategic alliances relating to other businesses, products or technologies. We may not be successful in integrating other businesses, products or technologies with our business. Any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company. We may enter into business combination transactions, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or alliances, any of which may be material. The market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive, which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities. If we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment, financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders, whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock.\nFor example, in 2020, we purchased Hanweck and the assets of FT Options, which are providers of risk analytics market data, the assets of Trade Alert, a real-time alerts and order flow analysis service provider, EuroCCP, an operator of a European clearinghouse, and MATCHNow, an operator of an equities ATS in Canada. At the end of 2020, we also purchased BIDS Trading, a registered broker-dealer and operator of the BIDS ATS in the U.S., which is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof.\nThe process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory issues and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm our reputation. We may not successfully achieve the integration objectives, and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings, revenue growth and synergies in full or at all, or it may take longer to realize them than expected, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. However, the ATS operated by BIDS Trading is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof, as such, Cboe intends to maintain the BIDS ATS as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the Exchanges.\nWe may be required to inject further capital into OCC or return dividends received back to OCC.\nOCC is the sole provider of clearing on all of our options and futures exchanges. In January 2020, upon receipt of SEC approval, OCC established a capital management policy providing that, if OCC’s equity capital falls below certain defined thresholds, OCC can access additional capital through an operational loss fee charged to clearing members. Although Cboe Options does not have a legal or contractual obligation to contribute capital to OCC under OCC’s capital management policy or otherwise, given OCC’s importance to Cboe’s businesses, if OCC were to experience financial difficulties, Cboe Options might nevertheless effectively (but not legally) be required to inject further capital into it in order for OCC to maintain sufficient working or regulatory capital. In a worst-case scenario, OCC might have its regulatory license suspended or withdrawn, or might have to wind down. This may result in a loss to Cboe Options of its investment in OCC and withdrawal of OCC as a clearing house, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, while OCC’s new capital management policy is now effective, there remains some degree of uncertainty as to the terms and conditions of the wind-down of OCC’s prior capital plan, under which OCC’s shareholders (including Cboe Options) provided equity capital to OCC and received annual dividends in respect thereof, and which was disapproved by the SEC on February 13, 2019. Depending on the terms on which the prior OCC capital plan is ultimately required to be unwound, Cboe Options could potentially be required to return dividend payments received from OCC during the time the capital plan was in effect.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures, fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.\nCboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA are registered national securities exchanges and SROs, and, as such, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the SEC. CFE is a DCM and Cboe SEF is a SEF, each registered with the CFTC and subject to comprehensive regulation by the CFTC. In addition to its other SRO responsibilities, BZX, as a listing market, also is responsible for evaluating applications submitted by issuers interested in listing their securities on BZX and monitoring each issuer’s compliance with BZX’s continued listing standards. Failure to comply with these SRO responsibilities could result in potential sanctions or fines and a negative impact on Cboe’s reputation and/or branding.\nOur European businesses are subject to regulatory oversight in the UK by the FCA and in the Netherlands by the DNB and the AFM, which, through the “passporting” regime, provides authorization to carry on business in other Member\n40\nStates of the EU and the EEA in accordance with the applicable EU legislation and regulation to which our European business is subject. MATCHNow is subject to regulatory oversight in Canada by the IIROC and the OSC. BIDS Trading is a registered broker-dealer subject to regulatory oversight in the U.S. by the SEC and FINRA and is expected to be maintained as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the SROs. BIDS Trading Chief Executive Officer, Tim Mahoney, is expected to remain in his current role and lead BIDS Trading as an independent business within Cboe, reporting into an independent committee of the Board of Directors of Cboe Global Markets. If a regulatory authority makes a finding of non-compliance, conditional fines could be imposed, and our licenses could be revoked. Any such fine or revocation of a license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition to the requirements related to operating our U.S. markets imposed by the SEC and the CFTC, we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the TPHs and members that trade on our Exchanges. While we have entered into agreements under which FINRA, with respect to our options and equities exchanges provides certain regulatory services, we retain ultimate responsibility for the regulation of our TPHs and members. We have begun to perform internally more of the regulatory services that FINRA used to handle and now perform internally the regulatory functions that NFA previously handled on behalf of CFE.\nOur ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, the ability of FINRA and OCC to perform under their respective RSAs, the ability of FINRA and OCC to transition to us any other potential responsibilities under their respective RSAs, our ability to complete the new additional responsibilities for regulating our TPHs and members and our oversight of the work done by FINRA and OCC. The SEC and CFTC have broad powers to audit, investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by, as applicable, SROs, DCMs and SEFs pursuant to applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nIf a regulatory authority were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient, our SROs, DCM, or SEF could be the subject of investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions, including revocation of registration as a national securities exchange, DCM, or SEF. Any such investigations or proceedings, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, the diversion of resources, including management time, and potential harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our SROs, DCM, or SEF may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment, or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions, each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate.\nIn addition, SROs are required by federal law to perform a variety of regulatory functions. In light of these responsibilities, some courts have held that SROs are immune to certain private causes of action relating to the performance of these regulatory functions. There is a risk that some courts may not apply this immunity doctrine to all claims. There is also a risk that legislative or regulatory developments may change the application of this immunity doctrine. Limitations on the application of the immunity doctrine could result in an increased exposure to litigation, and increase liability and/or other legal expenses. Further under the Commodity Exchange Act, CFE and Cboe SEF may be subject to litigation alleging that they have acted in bad faith. We also could be exposed to liability to regulators or other governmental authorities even in situations where immunity would bar a civil claim.\nLegislative or regulatory changes affecting our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in regulation by the SEC, CFTC, FCA, DNB, AFM, IIROC, OSC, foreign regulators or other government action, including SEC approval of rule filings by other SROs or entities, including OCC, could materially affect our markets and clearinghouse. In recent years, the securities and derivatives industries have been subject to regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny of the securities and derivatives industries. We have also experienced, and we may also experience due to the recent elections and changes in administrations in the U.S., an increase in rulemaking and legislation that could affect our business.\nStarting in 2015, large U.S. banks were required to use a calculation methodology known as the current exposure method (“CEM”) to compute regulatory capital requirements associated with the clearing guarantee provided by bank-affiliated OCC clearing members. U.S. banks, as well as European banks that also apply CEM, are required to maintain regulatory capital that is disproportionate to the risk of clearing options contracts and has led to further increases in capital requirements for bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries involved in the trading and clearing of derivatives. In\n41\nNovember 2019, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approved replacing CEM with a more risk-sensitive calculation method known as the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk (“SA-CCR”), which is expected to reduce capital requirements associated with the clearing of listed options. Banks subject to the November 2019 Final Rule are required to adopt SA-CCR by January 1, 2022 but have been able to do so since April 1, 2020. If the implementation of SA-CCR does not occur earlier than 2022, during that time we may experience a reduction in trading in options and futures due to bank-affiliated clearing members charging their customers more to trade, reducing the type or number of customers or withdrawing from the business of market-maker clearing.\nFurther, Congress, regulators and some media have been increasingly scrutinizing electronic trading and the structure of equity markets in recent years. The SEC continues to consider various potential market structure changes, which could result in reduced trading volumes, or which could negatively affect our business. To the extent the SEC adopts regulatory changes, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, high frequency trading has been the subject of private litigation and we are party to one such matter. See Note 24 (“Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees—Legal Proceedings”) for more information. To the extent the SEC adopts additional regulatory changes related to market data and access and capacity, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, as discussed above, in December 2018, the SEC approved the transaction fee pilot. The transaction fee pilot or a successor may cause Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or challenge the transaction fee pilot or a successor and it may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, shifts in order flow away from exchanges were to occur. On June 16, 2020, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the transaction fee pilot and remanded it back to the SEC for reconsideration. See “Legal Proceedings” for more information.\nUnder EU regulations, European banks and other European financial institutions become subject to punitive capital charges if they transact options or futures through a non-qualifying clearinghouse. OCC, our clearinghouse for options and futures, is not currently recognized as a qualified clearinghouse by the EU; however, the OCC is working with the EU to qualify as a foreign clearinghouse equivalent. As a prerequisite to becoming qualified, OCC could be required by the EU to contribute significant capital to its default waterfall applicable in the event of clearing member default. This capital could be required to be drawn before the default fund contributions of non-defaulting clearing members in the event that a defaulting clearing member’s margin and other contributions were to be exhausted. OCC’s stockholders, including Cboe Options, could effectively be required to fund this capital. If the EU does not recognize OCC as a qualified clearinghouse by June 15, 2021 (or by a subsequent date in the event that the current deadline is extended), then European market participants that clear through OCC would become subject to punitive capital charges. As a result, we could experience the loss of a significant number of European market participants and a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe implementation of MiFID II and MiFIR in Europe at the beginning of 2018 has encouraged competition among market centers in Europe. MiFID II and MiFIR have introduced a number of new rules, including enhanced internal organizational and compliance monitoring requirements, which apply directly to European trading venues such as our MTF and RM. The impact of MiFID II and MiFIR is significant, and the increased competition among market centers could reduce trading volumes and trading fees, while increasing our costs of operating in Europe. Additionally, European authorities are planning to continue to review MiFID in 2021 as a result of which new rules may come into effect that could have a material impact on our business.\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which the spot FX market operates is evolving and has undergone significant changes in the recent past, and there may be future regulatory changes in the spot FX industry. The FX Global Code was published in 2017 and sets forth standards of conduct agreed by market participants and central banks on a global basis to apply to the wholesale FX market, and the effect of its publication on conduct and future regulation continues to evolve. Cboe FX issued a Statement of Commitment declaring its commitment to conduct its FX market activities in a manner consistent with the principles of the FX Global Code. Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by applicable governmental bodies and regulatory organizations, or the adoption of new legal or regulatory requirements, may also adversely affect our spot FX business. Further, our FX NDF business may also be adversely affected by proposed regulatory changes to the rules governing swap execution facilities.\nIt is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate our businesses. Actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the U.S. or Europe and other proposals could have a material impact on our business.\n42\nIn addition, U.S. and foreign legislatures and regulators and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could materially adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the securities industry at all. Any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants’ trading activity on our Exchanges and markets.\nIf one or more of the index providers from which we have licenses or service providers with respect to proprietary products fails to maintain the quality and integrity of their indices or fails to perform under our agreements with them or if customer preferences change, or if we fail to maintain the quality and integrity of our proprietary indices, revenues we generate from trading in these proprietary products or the calculation and dissemination of index values may suffer.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements pursuant to which we may list for trading securities options on various indices including license agreements that we have with S&P, for the S&P 500, S&P 100 and S&P Select Sectors Indices, DJIA, LSEG and MSCI. These license agreements provide that we are authorized to list products based on their indices, and some of the resulting index options and futures are among the most actively traded products on our exchanges. We also enter into licensing agreements pursuant to which we calculate and disseminate values of proprietary indices. The quality and integrity of each of these indices are dependent on the ability of the index providers, including us, to maintain the index, including by means of the calculation and rebalancing of the index, and are dependent on the index providers for a number of things, including the provision of index data. We also rely on index providers to enforce intellectual property rights against unlicensed uses of the indices and uses of the indices that infringe on our licenses. Furthermore, some of our agreements concerning our proprietary products provide for the parties to those agreements to provide important services to us. If any of our index providers, including us, are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of their indices, or if any of the index providers or service providers fail to perform their obligations under the agreements, trading in these products, and therefore transaction fees we receive, may be materially adversely affected or we may not receive the financial benefits of the agreements that we negotiated.\nAny infringement by us on intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur competitors, as well as others, have obtained, or may obtain, patents or may otherwise hold intellectual property rights that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. We may not be aware of all intellectual property that may pose a risk of infringement by our products, services or technologies. In addition, some potential patent applications in the U.S. are confidential until a patent is issued, and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products, services or technologies may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications. Thus, we cannot be sure that our products, services or technologies do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us. Claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry, and even if we believe that such claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management resources and attention. If one or more of our products, services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another party, we may be required to pay damages, stop using, developing or marketing those products, services or technologies, obtain a license from the intellectual property rights holders, or redesign those products, services or technologies to avoid infringement. If we were required to stop using, developing or marketing certain products, services or technologies, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed. Moreover, if we were unable to obtain required licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products, services or technologies to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMisconduct by our TPHs, members, participants or others could harm us.\nWe run the risk that our TPHs, members, participants, other persons who use our markets or our products, other persons for whom we clear transactions, our employees or those with which we have business relationships may engage in fraud, market or product manipulation, or other misconduct, which could result in regulatory and legal sanctions and penalties and serious harm to our reputation, especially because we are the parent company of SROs. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, or market or product manipulation, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. In addition, misconduct, or market or product manipulation by, or failures of, participants on our or other exchanges may discourage trading on our Exchanges or of our products, which could reduce revenues.\n43\nPotential conflicts of interest between our for-profit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business.\nAs a for-profit business with regulatory responsibilities, we are responsible for disciplining TPHs and members for violating our rules, including by imposing fines and sanctions. This may create a conflict of interest between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities. Any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation, increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the SEC or CFTC to take action against us, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nBIDS Trading’s ability to operate under its current regulatory framework is dependent upon the sufficiency of a novel operational and governance framework we have developed to govern our relationship with BIDS Trading and our ability to comply with such framework and if we fail to adhere to such framework or the BIDS Trading ATS is otherwise deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\n​\nThe U.S. equities ATS operated by BIDS Trading is regulated as a broker-dealer sponsored alternative trading system and not a registered national securities exchange. Because we acquired BIDS Trading, it is now under common ownership with our registered national securities exchanges that, in some cases, offer trading in the same securities as those traded on the BIDS Trading ATS. Absent sufficient separation, this common ownership of an ATS and registered national securities exchanges offering trading in the same securities presents the potential for the BIDS Trading ATS to be deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges. If the BIDS Trading ATS were to be deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges, certain exchange regulations could be extended to the BIDS Trading ATS, which could have a material adverse impact on BIDS Trading’s business model. This could reduce the BIDS Trading ATS’ competitiveness and volumes and could result in a reduction of the value of the BIDS Trading ATS to us. This could also potentially result in fines or other penalties being assessed against us for our failure to operate the BIDS Trading ATS as a “facility,” which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results\n.\n​\nTo mitigate the risk that the BIDS Trading ATS is deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges, we have developed and implemented an operational and governance framework for our ownership of BIDS Trading that is intended to preserve the strategic, technological, business, and operational independence of the BIDS Trading ATS from our registered national securities exchange businesses, such that the BIDS Trading ATS and our registered national securities exchanges would not be deemed to be integrated or otherwise linked for “facility” purposes. This framework is supported by highly detailed policies, procedures and controls. However, because of the lack of precedent for common ownership of an ATS and registered national security exchanges offering trading in the same securities, there is risk that our framework and supporting policies, procedures and controls could be deemed to be insufficient to prevent the BIDS Trading ATS from being deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges.  In addition, because of the comprehensive and highly detailed nature of our framework and supporting policies, procedures and controls, there is risk that we could inadvertently fail to fully adhere to our operational and governance framework and related policies, procedures and controls. There is also risk that new legislation or regulation, or changes in existing regulation or other government action, relating to “facilities” of registered national securities exchanges and/or the common ownership of an ATS and registered national securities exchanges offering trading in the same securities could materially affect our ability to own and operate the BIDS Trading ATS under the current operational and governance framework, including without the BIDS Trading ATS being deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges. Occurrence of any of the risks described in this paragraph could result in the BIDS Trading ATS being deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges, which could reduce the BIDS Trading ATS’ competitiveness and volumes and could result in a reduction of the value of the BIDS Trading ATS to us, and could also potentially result in fines or other penalties being assessed against us for our failure to operate the BIDS Trading ATS as a “facility,” which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nBrexit could have a negative impact on the UK and EU economies and lead to considerable uncertainty while new treaties are negotiated.\nIn addition to the economic uncertainty the Brexit Vote, Brexit and expiration of the Transition Period bring, there are a number of potential risks that investors should consider:\n44\nOnce the UK ceased to be a member state of the EU, new restrictions on share trading came into force when trading began on January 4, 2021, preventing EU firms from accessing UK venues in EEA-listed securities. Passporting arrangements ceased to be effective, as did the mutual rights of access to market infrastructure and arrangements for mutual recognition of bank recovery and resolution regimes.\nNow that the UK has ceased to be a member state of the EU, the ability of regulated financial institutions to do business between the UK and the EU27 (and the wider EEA) is now subject to the potential development of future separate arrangements between the UK and the EEA. There can be no assurance that there will be any such arrangements concluded and, if they are concluded, on what terms.\nIn 2020, we derived 9.1% of our total revenues less cost of revenues from our UK operations. Depending on the outcome of the future separate arrangements between the UK and the EEA, companies with operations in the UK may face unfavorable business conditions to access the single market. In preparation for the current situation, Cboe Europe Equities established a regulated entity in the EU in addition to its existing entity in the UK so that it can continue offering its services to customers in both jurisdictions. Since the start of trading on January 4, 2021, the services of this new entity have been used more extensively, because Cboe Europe has seen a shift of almost all trading in EEA instruments from its UK to its EU venue. Similarly, EuroCCP participates in the UK Temporary Recognition Regime for CCP’s allowing it to continue to operate in the UK as a CCP for up to three years after the UK ceases to be a member state of the EU pending permanent recognition under UK domestic law. Nevertheless, if the EU or the UK introduce new legislation that could restrict free competition or access to capital markets, the impact of such legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our risk management and compliance methods are not effective, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, risk, audit, and reporting systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance, risk and audit management personnel. These systems and procedures may not be fully effective. We face the risk of intervention by regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance activity. In the case of actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in penalties, settlements or civil lawsuits, including by customers, or third parties, for damages, which may be substantial. For example, the SEC has previously brought actions against exchange operators, including us, for failing to fulfill their obligations to have an effective regulatory system. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and rules could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and operating\n45\nresults and, in extreme cases, our ability to conduct our business or portions thereof. As the parent company for SROs, other markets, and a clearinghouse, we are responsible for maintaining markets that comply with securities and futures laws, SEC, FCA, AFM, DNB, IIROC, OSC, ESMA, and CFTC regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges, markets and clearinghouse.\nWe have methods to identify, monitor and manage our risks. Management of legal, compliance, and regulatory risk, among other risks, requires policies and procedures to properly monitor and manage risk. If our policies, procedures, and compliance systems are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed, our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective, or that our management, compliance department, risk department and related enterprise risk management program and internal audit department would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness. If these departments or the enterprise risk program, and related policies and procedures are not effective, we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators, and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage.\nOur ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation, which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes.\nOur Exchanges registered with the SEC must submit proposed rule changes to the SEC for its review and, in many cases, its approval. Even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the SEC, the SEC retains the right to suspend and disapprove such a rule change. Also, the CFTC may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for CFE or Cboe SEF. The rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets. If the SEC or CFTC delays, including because of a government shutdown, or does not allow one of our Exchanges to implement a rule change, this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities.\nSimilarly, the SEC must approve amendments to our exchange subsidiaries’ certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Cboe Global Markets. The SEC may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change, which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products.\nChanges in the tax laws and regulations affecting us, our products and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLegislation may be proposed, both domestically and internationally, that could add a transaction tax on our products or change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets. More recently, a number of federal, state and local jurisdictions in the U.S. and EU Member States have considered a financial transaction tax, but many details remain to be discussed and agreed, including how to assess the tax. If such proposals were to become law, they could have a negative impact on the securities industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants, which may reduce trading or clearing and could make our markets less competitive, and they could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity, which would have a negative impact on our operations.\nIn addition to proposed tax changes that could affect our market participants, like other corporations, we are subject to taxes at federal, state and local levels, as well as in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, regulations or policies or successful claims by tax authorities could result in our having to pay higher taxes, which would in turn reduce our net income. If this occurs, we may experience a higher effective tax rate.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Indebtedness\nWe have outstanding indebtedness, which may decrease our business flexibility and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $68.7 million outstanding under our term loan facility, $645.9 million of senior unsecured notes due 2027, $489.3 million of senior unsecured notes due 2030, no funds outstanding under our revolving credit facility and no funds outstanding under the EuroCCP credit facility. The financial and other covenants to which we have agreed and our indebtedness may have the effect of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions. Further, we may\n46\ndefault on our obligations or violate the covenants, in which case, we may be required to seek a waiver of such default or the debt obligations may be accelerated. A default under any of our indebtedness with cross default provisions could result in a default on our other indebtedness. Our indebtedness will also increase future borrowing costs, and the covenants pertaining thereto may also limit our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock, increase dividends or obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate requirements. We are also required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Further, a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates unless we enter into offsetting hedging transactions.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to affect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing consequences could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nDeterioration in our credit profile may increase our costs of borrowing money.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have investment grade credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings (A-) and Moody’s Investor Service (A3). Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There is no assurance that we will maintain such credit ratings, since credit ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. If a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade, our borrowing costs could increase.\nIf our goodwill, long-lived assets, investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets become impaired, the resulting charge to earnings may be significant.\nWe are required to assess investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets for impairment at least annually. Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired. In the future, we may take charges against earnings resulting from impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill, long-lived assets, intangible assets or investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon the earnings and cash flow of our operating subsidiaries. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAny decision to pay dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors, which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount. The board’s determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and the SEC and other factors that the board deems relevant. As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, Cboe Global Markets depends entirely on distributions, if any, it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders. If these subsidiaries are not profitable, or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses, we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders.\n47\nCertain provisions in our organizational documents and governing law could prevent or delay a change of control.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that stockholders might find favorable, including discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control or any unsolicited acquisition proposals for us. These include provisions:\n​\nIn addition, our organizational documents include provisions that:\n​\nFurthermore, our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval. Any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends, liquidation rights and, possibly, voting rights. The ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals, thus materially adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.\nDelaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the board’s wishes. Under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a Delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances, including by approval of the corporation’s board of directors.\nFurthermore, the European countries where we operate regulated entities, such as the UK and Netherlands, may require prior governmental approval before an investor acquires 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock."

The pilot will subject stock exchange transaction fee pricing, including maker-taker fee-and-rebate pricing models, to new temporary pricing restrictions across two test groups, and require the exchanges to prepare data to be submitted to the SEC. The pilot includes a test group that will prohibit rebates and linked pricing, as well as a test group that will impose a cap of $0.0010 for removing or providing displayed liquidity. Once commenced, the pilot will last for up to two years with an automatic sunset at one year unless extended by the SEC. On February 15, 2019, the Company filed a Petition for Review in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the “D.C. Circuit”) asserting the pilot is unlawful. The pilot was published in the Federal Register on February 20, 2019 and was scheduled to become effective on April 22, 2019. On\n49\nMarch 28, 2019, the SEC granted a partial stay of the pilot, agreeing to delay implementing its fee-and-rebate and data-publication requirements until after the D.C. Circuit decides the pending challenges. The data-gathering requirement of the pilot’s pre-pilot period remains in effect. On May 21, 2019, the SEC issued its notice to announce the effective period for the pre-pilot, which was designated as July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019. On June 3, 2019, the Company, along with other equities exchanges, filed an opening brief with the D.C. Circuit. The SEC filed its opening brief with the D.C. Circuit on July 25, 2019, the exchanges’ reply brief was filed on August 26, 2019 and final briefs were filed on September 10, 2019. Oral arguments were held on October 11, 2019. On June 16, 2020, the D.C. Circuit granted the Petition for Review, vacated the pilot and remanded the matter back to the SEC for reconsideration. The SEC did not file a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court by November 13, 2020. The matter is now concluded.\n​\nConsolidated Data Plans\n​\nOn May 6, 2020, the SEC issued a final order (the “Consolidated Data Plan Order”) that would require U.S. equities exchanges and FINRA to develop and file a new consolidated data plan (the “Plan”) that would replace the three current U.S. equities tape data plans and require certain governance provisions, such as changes to the voting structure. Pursuant to the Consolidated Data Plan Order, the Company and the other U.S. equities exchanges and FINRA are required to file the proposed Plan for public comment before the SEC takes any definitive action on such new plan. Until and if the SEC approves a new plan, the current data plans will continue to govern. On June 29, 2020, the Company filed a Petition for Review in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the “D.C. Circuit”) asserting the Consolidated Data Plan Order is unlawful. On October 14, 2020, the D.C. Circuit issued an order setting forth a briefing schedule and briefing will conclude on March 12, 2021. The Consolidated Data Plan Order may cause the Company’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or challenge the Consolidated Data Plan Order and it may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, there is a negative impact on the market data fees the Company’s equities exchanges are able to charge. The Company intends to litigate the matter vigorously\n.\nMarket Data Infrastructure Rule\n​\nOn December 9, 2020, the SEC issued a Market Data Infrastructure Final Rule, which makes significant additions to the content available on the Securities Information Processors (“SIPs”) and replaces the exclusive processors with a competing consolidator model. On February 5, 2021, the Company, along with other equity exchanges, filed: (1) a Motion to Stay of the Market Data Infrastructure Rule with the SEC, and (2) a Petition for Review in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the “D.C. Circuit”). The implementation of the new rules could cause Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or to challenge the new rules and they may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, there are lower SIP plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data. The Company intends to litigate the matter vigorously\n."

Future debt obligations and statutory provisions, among other things, may limit, or in some cases prohibit, our ability to pay dividends.\nAs a holding company, the Company’s ability to declare and continue to pay dividends in the future with respect to its common stock will also be dependent upon the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to it under applicable corporate law.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNot applicable.\nUse of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn 2011, the board of directors approved an initial authorization for the Company to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock of $100 million and approved additional authorizations of $100 million in each of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, $150 million in February 2018, $100 million in August 2018, $250 million in October 2019, and $250 million in June 2020, for a total authorization of $1.4 billion. The Company expects to fund repurchases primarily through the use of existing cash balances. The program permits the Company to purchase shares through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws. It does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at any specific time or situation.\nUnder the program, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 3,534,115 shares of common stock at an average cost per share of $98.78, totaling $349.1 million. Since inception of the program through December 31, 2020, the Company has repurchased 17,250,124 shares of common stock at an average cost per share of $66.66, totaling $1.1 billion.\n​\n51\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $200.1 million of availability remaining under its existing share repurchase authorizations.\n​\nPurchase of common stock from employees\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020, we purchased shares from employees in connection with the settlement of employee tax withholding obligations arising from the vesting of restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and stock options. The table below represents repurchases made by or on behalf of us or any “affiliated purchaser” of our common stock during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020:\n​\nStockholder Return Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total return provided to stockholders on our common stock since our initial public offering against the return of the S&P 500 Index and a customized peer group that includes CME Group Inc., Intercontinental Exchange Inc., and Nasdaq, Inc.\n​\n52\nAn investment of $100, with reinvestment of all dividends, is assumed to have been made in our common stock, the index and the peer groups on December 31, 2015, and its performance is tracked on an annual basis through December 31, 2020.\nComparison of Cumulative Total Return of the\nCompany, Peer Groups, Industry Indices and/or Broad Markets\nCOMPARISON OF 5 YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN*\nAmong Cboe Global Markets, Inc., the S&P 500 Index\nand a Peer Group\n​\n​\n​\n​\n53\nItem 6.\nSelected Financial Data\nThe following selected financial and operating data should be read in conjunction with \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Items 7 and 8, respectively of this Form 10-K.

(“Cboe” or “the Company”) is one of the world’s largest exchange holding companies, offering cutting-edge trading and investment solutions to investors around the world. The Company is committed to defining markets to benefit its participants and drive the global marketplace forward through product innovation, leading edge technology and seamless trading solutions.\nCboe offers trading across a diverse range of products in multiple asset classes and geographies, including options, futures, U.S., Canadian and European equities, exchange-traded products (“ETPs”), global foreign exchange (“FX”) and volatility products based on the VIX Index, recognized as the world’s premier gauge of U.S. equity market volatility.\nCboe’s subsidiaries include the largest options exchange and the third largest stock exchange operator in the U.S. In addition, the Company operates one of the largest stock exchanges by value traded in Europe, and owns EuroCCP, a leading pan-European equities clearinghouse, MATCHNow, a leading equities ATS in Canada, and as of December 31, 2020, BIDS Trading, the leading block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S. Cboe also is a leading market globally for ETP listings and trading.\nThe Company is headquartered in Chicago with offices in Kansas City, New York, London, San Francisco, Sarasota Springs, Toronto, Belfast, Amsterdam, Calgary, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Ecuador.\n56\nRecent Developments\nAcquisitions of Hanweck, FT Options and Trade Alert\nOn February 3, 2020, the Company purchased Hanweck Associates, LLC (“Hanweck”) and the assets of FT Providers, LLC (“FT Options”). Hanweck is a real-time risk analytics company based in New York. FT Options is a portfolio management platform provider based in Chicago. Both companies are providers of risk analytics market data and included in the Company’s Options segment. Additionally, on June 1, 2020, the Company purchased the assets of Trade Alert, LLC (“Trade Alert”), a real-time alerts and order flow analysis service provider included in the Company’s Options segment. Hanweck, FT Options, and TradeAlert are being integrated with Cboe Information Solutions’ comprehensive suite of data solutions, analytics and indices that help market participants understand and access financial markets. See Note 5 (“Acquisitions”) for more information.\nChicago Trading Floor\nOn March 13, 2020, the Cboe Options trading floor was temporarily closed and transitioned to all-electronic trading mode as a precautionary measure to reduce the risk of COVID-19. The Cboe Options trading floor reopened on June 15, 2020 and is accommodating open-outcry trading activity with a modified floor layout, with stringent health and safety protocols in place for the well-being of the trading floor community, which includes Cboe associates and trading permit holders.\nAcquisition of EuroCCP\nOn July 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 80% interest in EuroCCP which is included in the Company’s European Equities segment. EuroCCP is a European equities central counterparty that provides post-trade services to stock exchanges, MTFs and for over-the-counter trades. EuroCCP clears equities from eighteen European markets and from the United States, as well as Depositary Receipts, ETFs, and exchanged traded currencies. In connection with the acquisition, EuroCCP put in place a committed revolving credit facility of up to €1.5 billion, see Note 13 (“Debt”) for more information.\nAcquisition of MATCHNow\nOn August 4, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of MATCHNow, one of the largest equities ATSs in Canada, which is included in the Company’s North American Equities segment. MATCHNow is a Canadian marketplace that offers execution for institutional, proprietary, and retail orders by combining frequent call matches and continuous execution opportunities in a fully confidential trading book. See Note 5 (“Acquisitions”) for more information.\nAcquisition of BIDS Holdings\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of BIDS Holdings, which is included in the Company’s North American Equities segment. BIDS Holdings owns BIDS Trading, a registered broker-dealer and the operator of the BIDS ATS. The BIDS ATS is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof. BIDS Trading’s proven block trading capability provides the Company a foothold in the off-exchange segment of the U.S. equities market. Additionally, BIDS Trading’s differentiated network of global buy-side investment managers and sell-side constituents provides the foundation for Cboe to potentially build more off-exchange products and services in non-U.S. equities or options products and in other geographies beyond the U.S.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company reports five business segments: Options, North American Equities, Futures, European Equities, and Global FX. Segment performance is primarily based on operating income (loss). The Company has aggregated all of its corporate costs and eliminations, as well as other business ventures, within Corporate Items and Eliminations; however, operating expenses that relate to activities of a specific segment have been allocated to that segment. Our management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages our business according to these segments:\nOptions.\nThe Options segment includes listed options on market indices (“index options”), as well as on the stocks of individual corporations (“equity options”) and options on ETPs, such as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and exchange-traded notes (“ETNs”), which are “multi-listed” options and listed on a non-exclusive basis. These options trade on Cboe Options, C2 Options, BZX Options, and EDGX Options, all U.S. national security exchanges. Cboe Options is the\n57\nCompany’s primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on the Cboe Options trading floor in Chicago. There was a temporary suspension of open outcry trading between March 13, 2020 and June 14, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. C2 Options, BZX Options, and EDGX Options are all-electronic options exchanges, and typically operate with different market models and fee structures than Cboe Options. The Options segment also includes applicable market data revenue generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary options market data, index licensing, and access and capacity services.\nNorth American Equities (formerly U.S. Equities).\nThe North American Equities segment includes listed U.S. equities and ETP transaction services that occur on fully electronic exchanges owned and operated by BZX Equities, BYX Equities, EDGX Equities, and EDGA Equities and Canadian equities and other transaction services that occur on or through the MATCHNow ATS. This segment was previously referred to as the U.S. Equities segment, but has been updated as a result of the acquisition of MATCHNow, which provides Canadian equities and other transaction services. In addition, in connection with the closing of the acquisition of BIDS Trading, starting January 1, 2021, this segment also includes equities transactions that occur on the BIDS Trading platforms. The North American Equities segment also includes ETP listings on BZX, the Cboe Global Markets, Inc. common stock listing, applicable market data revenue generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary equities market data, routing services, access and capacity services and advertising activity from ETF.com.\nFutures.\nThe Futures segment includes transaction services provided by the Company’s fully electronic futures exchange, CFE, which includes offerings for trading VIX futures and other futures products, the licensing of proprietary market data, as well as access and capacity services.\nEuropean Equities.\nThe European Equities segment includes the pan-European listed equities transaction services, ETPs, exchange traded commodities, and international depository receipts that are hosted on MTFs operated by Cboe Europe Equities. It also includes the ETP listings business on RMs and clearing activities of EuroCCP. Cboe Europe Equities operates lit and dark books, a periodic auctions book, and a Large-in-Scale (“LIS”) trading negotiation facility. Cboe NL, launched in October 2019, operates similar business functionality to that offered by Cboe Europe, and provides for trading only in European Economic Area symbols. Cboe Europe Equities also includes revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.\nGlobal FX.\nThe Global FX segment includes institutional FX trading services that occur on the Cboe FX fully electronic trading platform, non-deliverable forward FX transactions (“NDFs”) offered for execution on Cboe SEF and Cboe Swiss, as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.\nGeneral Factors Affecting Results of Operations\nIn broad terms, our business performance is impacted by a number of drivers, including macroeconomic events affecting the risk and return of financial assets, investor sentiment, the regulatory environment for capital markets, geopolitical events, tax policies, central bank policies and changing technology, particularly in the financial services industry. We believe our future revenues and net income will continue to be influenced by a number of domestic and international economic trends, including:\n58\nA number of significant structural, political and monetary issues and the COVID-19 pandemic continue to confront the global economy, and instability could continue, resulting in an increased or subdued level of market volatility, changes in trading volumes and greater uncertainty.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. We are closely monitoring developments around COVID-19 and following guidance provided by governmental and public health agencies. In response to COVID-19, we have provided frequent communications to employees, customers, regulators, critical vendors, technology equipment suppliers, data and disaster recovery centers, and other service providers and instructed non-essential employees to work from home on a temporary basis, implemented travel restrictions, and temporarily suspended open outcry trading between March 13, 2020 and June 14, 2020, without any known significant disruptions to our business or control processes. We expect to continue to take further actions as necessary in response to addressing COVID-19. As of the date of this report, it is too early to determine the full impact this virus may have on the global financial markets and the overall economy. Our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by the effects of COVID-19, however, the extent to which our results could be affected by COVID-19 largely depends on future developments which cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain. Further, changes in trading behavior, additional suspensions of open outcry trading, market disruptions and other future developments caused by the effects of COVID-19 could impact trading volumes and the demand for our products, market data, and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows for fiscal year 2021 and could be material during any future period impacted either directly or indirectly by this pandemic.\nComponents of Revenues\nTransaction and Clearing Fees\nTransaction fees represent fees charged by the Company for the performance obligation of executing a trade on its markets. These fees can be variable based on trade volume tiered discounts; however, as all tiered discounts are calculated monthly, the actual discount is recorded on a monthly basis. Transaction fees are recognized across all segments. Clearing fees, which include settlement fees, are charged by the Company for transactions cleared and settled by EuroCCP. Clearing fees can be variable based on trade volume tiered discounts; however, as all tiered discounts are calculated monthly, the actual discount is recorded on a monthly basis. Clearing fees are recognized in the European Equities segment. Transaction and clearing fees, as well as any tiered volume discounts, are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with the Company’s published fee schedules.\nAccess and Capacity Fees\nAccess and capacity fees represent fees assessed for the opportunity to trade, including fees for trading-related functionality across all segments, terminal and other equipment rights, maintenance services, trading floor space and telecommunications services. Facilities, systems services and other fees are generally monthly fee-based. These fees are billed monthly in accordance with the Company’s published fee schedules and recognized on a monthly basis when the performance obligation is met. All access and capacity fees associated with the trading floor are recognized in the Options segment. There is no remaining performance obligation after revenue is recognized.\nMarket Data Fees\nMarket data fees represent the fees from the U.S. tape plans and fees from customers for proprietary market data. Fees from the U.S. tape plans are collected monthly based on published fee schedules and distributed quarterly to the U.S. Exchanges based on a known formula using trading and/or quoting activity. A contract for proprietary market data is entered into and charged on a monthly basis in accordance with the Company’s published fee schedules as the service is provided. Both types of market data are satisfied over time, and revenue is recognized on a monthly basis as the customer receives and consumes the benefit as the Company provides the data. U.S. tape plan market data is recognized in the North American Equities and Options segments. Proprietary market data fees are recognized across all segments.\nRegulatory Fees\nRegulatory fees primarily represent fees collected by the Company to cover the Section 31 fees charged to the Exchanges under the authority of the SEC (Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA) and are charged by the SEC. Consistent with industry practice, the fees charged to customers are based on the fee set by the SEC per notional value of U.S. Equities exchange transactions and per round turn of Options transactions executed on the Company’s U.S.\n59\nsecurities markets. These fees are calculated and billed monthly and are recognized in the North American Equities and Options segments. As the Exchanges are responsible for the ultimate payment to the SEC, the Exchanges are considered the principals in these transactions. Regulatory fees also include the options regulatory fee (“ORF”) which supports the Company’s regulatory oversight function in the Options segment, along with other miscellaneous regulatory fees, and neither can be used for non-regulatory purposes. The ORF and miscellaneous fees are recognized when the performance obligation is fulfilled.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue primarily includes among other items, revenue from various licensing agreements, interest income from clearing operations, all fees related to the trade reporting facility operated in the European Equities segment, and revenue associated with advertisements through the Company’s websites.\nComponents of Cost of Revenues\nLiquidity Payments\nLiquidity payments are directly correlated to the volume of securities traded on our markets. As stated above, we record the liquidity rebates paid to market participants providing liquidity, in the case of C2, BZX, EDGX, and Cboe Europe Limited, as cost of revenue. BYX and EDGA offer a pricing model where we rebate liquidity takers for executing against an order resting on our book, which is also recorded as a cost of revenue.\nRouting and Clearing\nVarious rules require that U.S. options and equities trade executions occur at the National Best Bid/Offer (“NBBO”) displayed by any exchange. Linkage order routing consists of the cost incurred to provide a service whereby Cboe equities and options exchanges deliver orders to other execution venues when there is a potential for obtaining a better execution price or when instructed to directly route an order to another venue by the order provider. The service affords exchange order flow providers an opportunity to obtain the best available execution price and may also result in cost benefits to those clients. Such an offering improves our competitive position and provides an opportunity to attract orders which would otherwise bypass our exchanges. We utilize third-party brokers or our broker-dealer, Cboe Trading, to facilitate such delivery. Also included within routing and clearing are settlement costs incurred for the settlement process executed by EuroCCP.\nSection 31 Fees\nExchanges under the authority of the SEC (Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA) are assessed fees pursuant to the Exchange Act designed to recover the costs to the U.S. government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. We treat these fees as a pass-through charge to customers executing eligible listed equities and listed equity options trades. Accordingly, we recognize the amount that we are charged under Section 31 as a cost of revenues and the corresponding amount that we charge our customers as regulatory transaction fees revenue. Since the regulatory transaction fees recorded in revenues are equal to the Section 31 fees recorded in cost of revenues, there is no impact on our operating income. CFE, Cboe Europe Limited and Cboe FX are not U.S. national securities exchanges, and accordingly are not charged Section 31 fees.\nRoyalty Fees\nRoyalty fees primarily consist of license fees paid by us for the use of underlying indices in our proprietary products usually based on contracts traded. The Company has licenses with the owners of the S&P 500 Index, S&P 100 Index and certain other S&P indices, FTSE Russell indices, the DJIA, MSCI, and certain other index products. This category also includes fees related to the dissemination of market data related to S&P indices and PULSe system terminal fees.\nComponents of Operating Expenses\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits represent our largest expense category and tend to be driven by our staffing requirements, financial performance, and the general dynamics of the employment market. Stock-based compensation is\n60\na non-cash expense related to equity awards. Stock-based compensation can vary depending on the quantity and fair value of the award on the date of grant and the related service period.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets purchased, the amortization of purchased and internally developed software, and the amortization of intangible assets.\nTechnology Support Services\nTechnology support services consists primarily of costs related to the maintenance of computer equipment supporting our system architecture, circuits supporting our wide area network, support for production software, operating system license and support fees, fees paid to information vendors for displaying data and off-site system hosting fees.\nProfessional Fees and Outside Services\nProfessional fees and outside services consist primarily of consulting services, which include supplemental staff activities primarily related to systems development and maintenance, legal, regulatory and audit, and tax advisory services.\nTravel and Promotional Expenses\nTravel and promotional expenses primarily consist of advertising, costs for special events, sponsorship of industry conferences, options education seminars and travel-related expenses.\nFacilities Costs\nFacilities costs primarily consist of expenses related to owned and leased properties including rent, maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes and telecommunications costs.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAcquisition-related costs relate to acquisitions and other strategic opportunities, including the Merger. The acquisition-related costs include fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors, public relations firms, severance and retention costs, impairment of goodwill, capitalized software and facilities, and other external costs directly related to the mergers and acquisitions, as well as compensation-related expenses.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses represent costs necessary to support our operations that are not already included in the above categories.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense)\nIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating and are classified as other income (expense). These activities primarily include interest earned on the investing of excess cash, interest expense related to outstanding debt facilities, dividend income, income and unrealized gains and losses related to investments held in a rabbi trust for the Company’s non-qualified retirement and benefit plans, and equity earnings or losses from our investments in other business ventures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following are summaries of changes in financial performance and include certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financials measures assist management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items management believes do not reflect our underlying operations. Please see the footnotes below for additional information and reconciliations from our consolidated financial statements.\n61\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nOverview\nThe following summarizes changes in financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019:\n​\n* Not meaningful\n62\n​\n63\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:\n​\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income allocated to common stockholders to adjusted earnings:\n​\n64\nThe following summarizes changes in certain operational and financial metrics for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Segment performance is primarily based on operating income (loss). We have aggregated all corporate costs, as well as other business ventures, within the Corporate Items and Eliminations as those activities should not be used to evaluate a segment's operating performance. All operating expenses that relate to activities of a specific segment have been allocated to that segment.\nThe following summarizes our total revenues by segment:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n73\nThe following summarizes our revenues less cost of revenues by segment:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n74\nOptions\nThe following summarizes revenues less cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, EBITDA and EBITDA margin for our Options segment:\n*  Not meaningful\nRevenues less cost of revenues increased $\n85.6\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a 53.7% increase in multi-listed options ADV, coupled with a 9.8% increase in index options RPC and an increase in proprietary market data revenue as a result of the acquisitions of Hanweck, FT Options, and Trade Alert.

In the near term, we expect that our cash from operations and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility will meet our cash needs to fund our operations, capital expenditures, interest payments on debt, debt repayments, any dividends, potential strategic acquisitions, and opportunities for common stock repurchases under the previously announced program. We may also utilize excess cash on hand to pay down amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement. See Note 13 (“Debt”) of the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOn July 1, 2020, in connection with the Company’s acquisition of EuroCCP, EuroCCP as borrower and the Company as guarantor of scheduled interest and fees on borrowings (but not the principal amount of any borrowings), entered into a\n€\n1.5 billion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility agreement (the “Facility”). The Facility is available to be drawn by EuroCCP towards (a) financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through EuroCCP’s clearing system and (b) financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of EuroCCP incurred in the operation of its clearing system. Borrowings under the Facility are secured by cash, eligible government bonds and eligible equity assets deposited by EuroCCP into secured accounts. As a result, should the Facility be drawn by EuroCCP it could potentially impact EuroCCP’s liquidity, and we can give no assurance that this Facility will be sufficient to meet all of such obligations or sufficiently mitigate EuroCCP’s liquidity risk to meet its payment obligations when due. Additionally, a default of the Facility may allow lenders, under certain circumstances, to accelerate any related drawn amounts and may result in the acceleration of the Company’s other outstanding debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which may limit the Company’s liquidity, business and financing activities. The Facility is expected to terminate on July 1, 2021 and we may not be able to enter into a replacement facility on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur long-term cash needs will depend on many factors, including an introduction of new products, enhancements of current products, the geographic mix of our business and any potential acquisitions. We believe our cash from operations and the availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will meet any long-term needs unless a significant acquisition is identified, in which case we expect that we would be able to borrow the necessary funds and/or issue additional shares of our common stock to complete such an acquisition. In addition, we do not expect COVID-19 to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources, including cash from operations or uses of cash, or change our ability to access capital markets in the near term or the foreseeable future.\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and all non-restricted, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 increased\n78\n$\n16.1\nmillion from December 31, 2019 primarily due to proceeds from long-term debt and net income, partially offset by acquisitions net of cash of acquired of $351.5 million and share repurchases of $349.1 million. See “Cash Flow” below for further discussion.\nOur cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States in various foreign subsidiaries totaled $128.2 million and $85.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The remaining balance was held in the United States and totaled $117.2 million and $144.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Any offshore cash repatriated to the United States could subject us to additional United States income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits.\nOur financial investments include deferred compensation plan assets, as well as investments with original or acquired maturities longer than three months but that mature in less than one year from the balance sheet date and are recorded at fair value. As of December 31, 2020, financial investments consisted of U.S. Treasury securities and deferred compensation plan assets.\nCash Flow\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n​\nNet Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $\n990.6\nmillion higher than net income. The variance is primarily attributed to the addition of $812.1 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents (margin deposits and clearing funds) resulting from the EuroCCP acquisition, the adjustment for depreciation and amortization expense of $158.5 million, the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $59.4 million, and the change in Section 31 fees payable of $53.9 million, partially offset by the change in accounts receivable of $90.0 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,458.8 million and $\n632.8\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the addition of margin deposits and clearing funds resulting from the EuroCCP acquisition and the increase in net income.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $\n262\n.0 million higher than net income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe variance is primarily attributed to the adjustment for depreciation expense of $176.6 million and the change in accounts receivable of $50.3 million, partially offset by the adjustment for provision of deferred taxes of $37.2 million, the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $25.7 million, and other prepaid expenses of $16.9 million.\n79\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $632.8 million and $534.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income.\nNet Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities was\n$430.5\nmillion and $15.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Expenditures for capital and other assets totaled $35.1 million and $36.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily representing purchases of systems hardware and development of software to develop and enhance our trading platform and operations. In 2019 and 2018, investing activities primarily represented purchases of property and equipment.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $60 to $65 million, reflecting expenditures associated with the Company’s planned trading floor relocation in 2021 and ongoing capacity and technology-related investments.\nNet Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received proceeds from long-term debt of $493.7 million, of which $70.0 million was used to pay down the revolving credit facility draw taken in the third quarter of 2020, repurchased $349.1 million of common stock, paid dividends totaling $170.6 million, and paid down $155.0 million of long-term debt.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities totaled $662.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company paid down $350.0 million of long-term debt, repurchased $156.9 million of common stock, and paid dividends of $150.0 million. Net cash flows used in financing activities totaled $371.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $291.3 million decrease in net cash flows provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the long-term debt repayment in 2019.\nFinancial Assets\nThe following summarizes our financial assets excluding margin deposits and clearing funds as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n​\n80\nDebt\nThe following summarizes our debt obligations as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n​\nAt December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements.\nIn addition to the debt outstanding, as of December 31, 2020 we had an additional $250.0 million available through our revolving credit facility, with the ability to borrow another $100.0 million by increasing the commitments under the facility. Together with Adjusted Cash, we had $460.3 million available to fund our operations, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, debt repayments and any dividends as of December 31, 2020.\nDividends\nThe Company’s expectation is to continue to pay dividends. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of the Company's board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. Future debt obligations and statutory provisions, among other things, may limit, or in some cases prohibit, our ability to pay dividends.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn 2011, the board of directors approved an initial authorization for the Company to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock of $100 million and approved additional authorizations of $100 million in each of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, $150 million in February 2018, $100 million in August 2018, $250 million in October 2019, and $250 million in June 2020, for a total authorization of $1.4 billion. The program permits the Company to purchase shares through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws. It does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at any specific time or situation.\nUnder the program, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 3,534,115 shares of common stock at an average cost per share of $98.78, totaling $349.1 million. Since inception of the program through December 31, 2020, the Company has repurchased 17,250,124 shares of common stock at an average cost per share of $66.66, totaling $1.1 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $200.1 million of availability remaining under its existing share repurchase authorizations.\nOCC Capital Management Policy\nThe Company’s contributed capital to OCC has been recorded under investments in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020. Under OCC’s current capital management policy, which was approved by the SEC on January 24, 2020, if OCC’s equity capital falls below certain defined thresholds, OCC can access additional capital through an operational loss fee charged to clearing members. None of OCC’s shareholders (including Cboe Options) has any obligation to contribute capital to OCC under the capital management policy, nor does any shareholder have the right to receive dividends from OCC under such policy. OCC did not pay its shareholders any dividend or other return on the retained portion of their capital contributions. As such, the Company reversed the $8.8 million OCC dividend declared in\n81\n2018, which was to be paid in 2019, in other expense, net in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLease and Obligations\nThe Company currently leases additional office space, data centers and remote network operations center, with lease terms remaining from 4 months to 180 months as of December 31, 2020. In September 2019, we entered into two leases that commenced in 2020 for a new principal office space and trading floor space, both located in Chicago, Illinois.\nTotal rent expense related to current and former lease obligations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 totaled $20.2 million, $12.4 million and $10.1 million, respectively. I\nn addition to our lease obligations, we have contractual obligations related to certain operating leases, data and telecommunications agreements, and our long-term debt outstanding.\nPurchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed or minimum and maximum amounts to be paid; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include licensing agreements with various licensors which contain annual minimum fee requirements that total $361.6 million for the next five years. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.\nWe have excluded from the contractual obligations listed below $812.1 million in cash margin deposits and clearing funds. Clearing participants of EuroCCP are required to make deposits to a clearing fund. The cash deposits made by clearing participants are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with equal and offsetting current liabilities. See Note 15 (“Clearing Operations”) to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on EuroCCP and the margin deposits and clearing funds.\nFuture minimum payments under these leases and agreements were as follows as of December 31, 2020:\n​\nCommercial Commitments and Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, our commercial commitments and contractual obligations included operating leases, data and telecommunications agreements, equipment leases, our long-term debt outstanding, contingent considerations and other obligations. See Note 24 (“Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees”) to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of commitments and contingencies, Note 13 (“Debt”) for a discussion of the outstanding debt, Note 15 (“Clearing Operations”) for information on EuroCCP’s clearinghouse exposure guarantee, and Note 25 (“Leases”) for discussion on operating leases and equipment leases.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSee Note 15 (“Clearing Operations”) for discussion of contingent assets and liabilities related to clearing operations in connection with the Company’s acquisition of EuroCCP.\nGuarantees\nWe use Wedbush and Morgan Stanley to clear our routed equities transactions for our U.S. Equities exchanges. Wedbush and Morgan Stanley guarantee the trade until one day after the trade date, after which time the NSCC provides a guarantee. In the case of failure to perform on the part of one of our clearing firms, Wedbush or Morgan Stanley, we provide the guarantee to the counterparty to the trade. OCC acts as a central counterparty on all transactions in listed equity options in our Options segment, and as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our options transactions. We believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and\n82\naccordingly, have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees.\nSimilarly, with respect to U.S. listed equity options and futures, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the OCC, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and CFE and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades. With respect to Canadian equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to The Canadian Depository for Securities, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on MATCHNow and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched Canadian equities trades. The BIDS Trading ATS platform delivers matched trades to BofA Securities, Inc., which delivers the matched trades to the NSCC.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of the amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, observance of trends in particular areas, information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources.\nWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note\n2\n(“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”)\nto our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor further discussion related to revenue recognition of fees, such as transaction and clearing fees, access and capacity fees, market data fees, and regulation transaction and Section 31 fees, see Note 4 (“Revenue Recognition”).\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nOur acquisitions of Bats, Cboe Vest Financial Group Inc. (“Vest”), Silexx Financial Systems, LLC (“Silexx”), LiveVol, Hanweck, FT Options, Trade Alert, MATCHNow, and BIDS Holdings resulted in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, while our acquisition of EuroCCP, resulted in a bargain purchase gain and other intangible assets. In accordance with ASC 350—\nIntangibles—Goodwill and Other\n, we test the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances signal indicators of impairment are present. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, using the October 1 carrying values. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level in accordance with ASC 350-20. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess. If the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference. We performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2020 and determined that no impairment existed.\nThe estimated fair values of our reporting units are based on the market approach and the income approach (using discounted estimated future cash flows). The estimated fair values of indefinite-lived intangibles used the income approach. The discounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgment, including judgments about the d\niscount rate, forecasted revenue growth rate, and operating expenses, that are inherent in these fair value estimates\nover the estimated remaining operating period. As such, actual results may differ from these estimates and lead to a revaluation of our\ngoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If updated estimates indicate that the fair value o\nf goodwill or any indefinite-lived intangibles is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is expected to be recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change in estimate.\n83\nPurchase Accounting\nTangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The difference between the purchase price amount and the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if the purchase price exceeds the estimated net fair value or as a bargain purchase gain on the income statement if the purchase price is less than the estimated net fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment, often utilizes independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, could significantly impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. When available, the estimated fair values of these assets and liabilities are determined based on observable inputs, such as quoted market prices, information from comparable transactions, offers made by other prospective acquirers, in such cases where we may have certain rights to acquire additional interests in existing investments, and the replacement cost of assets in the same condition or stage of usefulness (Level 1 and 2). Unobservable inputs, such as expected future cash flows or internally developed estimates of value (Level 3), are used if observable inputs are not available. As noted in ASC 805—\nBusiness Combinations\n, the allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to twelve months after the acquisition date as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nSee Note 5 (“Acquisitions”) for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in our opinion, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Also, interest and penalties expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision within the consolidated statements of income.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 3 (“Recent Accounting Pronouncements”) to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the Company\n.\n​\n​\n84"

    "text": "As a result of our operating activities, we are exposed to market risks such as foreign currency exchange rate risk, equity risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. We have implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage and monitor and report risk exposures, which are reviewed regularly by management and our board of directors.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nOur operations in Europe, Canada and Asia are subject to increased currency translation risk as revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Canadian dollar, Singapore dollar, Hong Kong dollar, and the Euro. We also have de minimis exposure to other foreign currencies, including the Swiss Franc, Norwegian Kroner, Swedish Krona and Danish Kroner.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our exposure to foreign-denominated revenues and expenses is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table:\nEquity Risk\nOur investment in European and Canadian operations is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates through translation of our net assets or equity to U.S. dollars. The assets and liabilities of our European business are denominated in British pounds or Euros. The assets and liabilities of our Canadian business are denominated in Canadian dollars. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate foreign currency reported statements of financial condition and operational results into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of these non-U.S. dollar statements of financial condition into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment, which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOur primary exposure to this equity risk as of December 31, 2020 is presented by foreign currency in the following table:\n​\n85\nCredit Risk\nWe are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. We limit our exposure to credit risk by considering such risk when selecting the counterparties with which we make investments and execute agreements.\nWe do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to trades matched on our exchanges in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. With respect to listed equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the National Security Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) without taking on counterparty risk for those trades. NSCC acts as a central counterparty on all equity transactions occurring on BZX, BYX, EDGX and EDGA and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched equity trades. Similarly, with respect to U.S. listed equity options and futures, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the OCC, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX and CFE and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades. With respect to Canadian equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to The Canadian Depository for Securities, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on MATCHNow and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched Canadian equities trades. The BIDS Trading ATS platform delivers matched trades to BofA Securities, Inc., which delivers the matched trades to the NSCC.\nWith respect to orders Cboe Trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers, Cboe Trading is exposed to some counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our clearing firms, Morgan Stanley or Wedbush. Morgan Stanley and Wedbush guarantee trades until one day after the trade date, after which time NSCC provides a guarantee. Thus, Cboe Trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to a trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that Morgan Stanley or Wedbush fails. We believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and accordingly, have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees.\nHistorically, we have not incurred any liability due to a customer’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade. Credit difficulties or insolvency, or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency, of one or more larger or more visible market participants could also result in market-wide credit difficulties or other market disruptions.\nWe do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to institutional spot FX trades occurring on our platform because Cboe FX is not a counterparty to any FX transactions. All transactions occurring on our platform occur bilaterally between two banks or prime brokers as counterparties to the trade. While Cboe FX does not have direct counterparty risk, Cboe FX may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event. Therefore, Cboe FX may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade FX on the Cboe FX platform.\nWe also have credit risk related to transaction fees that are billed in arrears to customers on a monthly basis. Our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our balance sheet. Our customers are financial institutions whose ability to satisfy their contractual obligations may be impacted by volatile securities markets.\nAs a result of the acquisition of EuroCCP on July 1, 2020, the Company is exposed to further credit risk through our clearing operations. EuroCCP holds material amounts of clearing participant collateral, both cash and non-cash deposits, which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit risk as well as liquidity and market risks. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated:\n•\nCredit Risk\n- The credit risk is predominantly in the event a clearing participant fails to meet a financial or contractual obligation. EuroCCP attempts to mitigate this risk through minimum participant requirements for clearing participants and monitoring their financial health. To cover potential loss to EuroCCP in the event of a clearing participant default, collateral is required from clearing participants. Besides potential defaults of clearing participants, the main credit risk faced by the clearinghouse is exposure to clearing participants when a trade fails to settle. To help mitigate this risk, a fail fee is charged to discourage late settlements. This fee covers EuroCCP’s costs but also acts as a deterrent as required by Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 on short selling, together with certain aspects of credit default swaps.\n•\nLiquidity Risk\n- Liquidity risk is the risk EuroCCP may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and at the right time. To help mitigate this risk, EuroCCP monitors its liquidity requirements\n86\nclosely and maintains funds and assets in a manner which attempt to minimize the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearinghouse to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short-term investments serves to help reduce liquidity risks. Liquidity is mainly required for securities settlement. The payment and settlement obligations generally stem from the function of EuroCCP as a cash equity clearinghouse: shares are bought and sold by clearing participants on a trading platform or OTC, and netted to settle two days later. During the settlement the actual payment for and delivery of the shares take place, this process requires intraday liquidity. If counterparties, which receive shares against payment, are unable to settle, an overnight liquidity need arises. The overnight liquidity is typically very short term, and is usually limited to a few days.\n•\nMarket Risk\n- EuroCCP is also exposed to market risk in the event that a clearing participant defaults and the market prices of the securities in its open positions have moved adversely so the clearinghouse can only close out the participant’s obligations at a loss. To help mitigate market risk, EuroCCP collects collateral from clearing participants to cover for the probable loss during normal market conditions, together with contributions to the clearing fund to cover losses if a default occurred during extreme but plausible market conditions. Adverse movements in exchange rates affecting the value of obligations and collateral are factored into the calculation of the amount of collateral to be collected.\nOn a regular basis, we review and evaluate changes in the status of our counterparties’ creditworthiness. Credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Any such effects to date have been minimal.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, financial investments, and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments were $337.8 million and $300.3 million, respectively, of which $128.0 million and $85.1 million is held outside of the United States in various foreign subsidiaries in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The remaining cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. Due to the nature of these investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1,203.9 million in outstanding debt, of which $1,135.2 million relates to our Senior Notes, which bear interest at fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on fixed-rate obligations. The remaining amounts outstanding of $68.7 million relates to the Term Loan Agreement, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2020 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $0.7 million, assuming no change in the composition of our outstanding indebtedness. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement and the EuroCCP Credit Facility, as these facilities bear interest at fluctuating rates. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit agreement and no outstanding borrowings under the EuroCCP Credit Facility. See Note 13 (“Debt”) to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt agreements.\nLiquidity Risk\nWe are exposed to liquidity risk under certain circumstances in relation to the cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions within the Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement as a result of the Company, as guarantor, entering into the EuroCCP Credit Facility. A default of the Facility may allow lenders to accelerate any related drawn amounts and may result in the acceleration of the Company’s other outstanding debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which may limit the Company’s liquidity, business and financing activities. See Note 13 (“Debt”) to the consolidated financial statements and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Item 7 (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis”) for a discussion of debt agreements.\n​\n87"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of goodwill impairment analysis for the Global FX reporting unit\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value may be impaired. This involves estimating the fair value of reporting units using discounted cash flow models.\nWe identified the evaluation of goodwill impairment analysis for the Global FX reporting unit as a critical audit matter. The determination of the fair value of the Global FX reporting unit requires management to make assumptions about the discount rate, forecasted revenue growth rates, and operating expenses used within the discounted cash flow model. A\n89\nhigher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate these assumptions. Changes to these assumptions could have a substantial impact on the estimated fair value of the Global FX reporting unit.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Global FX reporting unit goodwill impairment assessment process, including controls over the development and selection of forecasted revenue growth rates, operating expense, and discount rate assumptions. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s forecasted revenue growth rates for the Global FX reporting unit by comparing the assumptions to forecasted revenue growth rates in the Company’s and peer companies’ analyst reports. We also evaluated the Company’s ability to forecast revenue growth and operating expenses by comparing historical revenue growth and operating expense forecasts to actual results. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\nEvaluation of unrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position is measured based upon the largest benefit that has greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe identified the evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits in certain jurisdictions as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgement was required to evaluate the Company’s estimate of tax benefits to be realized upon ultimate settlement of its tax positions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls over the estimate of tax benefits to be realized upon ultimate settlement of tax positions. We evaluated the Company’s ability to estimate its unrecognized tax benefits by comparing historical unrecognized tax benefits to actual results upon the conclusion of examinations by applicable taxing authorities. In addition, we involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:\n​\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 19, 2021\n​\n90\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n​\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Cboe Global Markets, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n​\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 21, 2020\n​\nWe began serving as the Company’s auditor in 1973. In 2020 we became the predecessor auditor.\n91\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nCboe Global Markets, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Cboe Global Markets, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nManagement’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, excluded EuroCCP, acquired with effect from July 1, 2020; MATCHNow, acquired with effect from August 4, 2020; and BIDS Holdings, acquired with effect from December 31, 2020. These acquired businesses had aggregate total assets and total stockholders’ equity of $1.3 billion and $205.2 million, respectively, and total revenues and revenues less cost of revenues of $30.4 million and $24.2 million, respectively, which are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of EuroCCP, MATCHNow, and BIDS Holdings.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\n92\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 19, 2021\n​\n​\n​\n93\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated\nBalance Sheets\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019\n(In millions, except share and per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements\n.\n​\n94\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nYears ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(In millions, except per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements\n.\n​\n95\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nYears ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements\n.\n​\n​\n​\n96\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity\nYears ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n​\n​\n97\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nYears ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(In millions)\nSee\naccompanying notes to consolidated financial statements\n.\n​\n​\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for the\nYears ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n1.  NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. (“Cboe” or “the Company”) is one of the world’s largest exchange holding companies, offering cutting-edge trading and investment solutions to investors around the world. The Company is committed to defining markets to benefit its participants and drive the global marketplace forward through product innovation, leading edge technology and seamless trading solutions.\nCboe offers trading across a diverse range of products in multiple asset classes and geographies, including options, futures, U.S., Canadian and European equities, exchange-traded products (“ETPs”), global foreign exchange (“FX”) and volatility products based on the VIX Index, recognized as the world’s premier gauge of U.S. equity market volatility.\nCboe’s subsidiaries include the largest options exchange and the third largest stock exchange operator in the U.S. In addition, the Company operates one of the largest stock exchanges by value traded in Europe, and owns EuroCCP, a leading pan-European equities clearinghouse, BIDS Trading, a leading block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S., and MATCHNow, a leading equities ATS in Canada. Cboe also is a leading market globally for ETP listings and trading.\nThe Company is headquartered in Chicago with offices in Kansas City, New York, London, San Francisco, Sarasota Springs, Toronto, Belfast, Amsterdam, Calgary, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Ecuador.\n2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThese consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) as established by FASB.\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis to include the accounts and transactions of Cboe Global Markets, Inc. and its majority owned subsidiaries and all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates based upon historical experience, observance of trends, information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions.\nFor those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company’s ownership is less than 100% and for which the Company has control over the assets and liabilities and the management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interest is shown as noncontrolling interest.\nSegment information\nThe Company has\nfive\nbusiness segments: Options, North American Equities (formerly U.S. Equities), Futures, European Equities, and Global FX, which is reflective of how the Company’s chief operating decision-maker reviews and operates the business. See Note 17 (“Segment Reporting”) for more information.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of the amounts\n99\nof contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term include the valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. The Company maintains cash at various regulated financial institutions and brokerage firms which, at times, may be in excess of the federal depository insurance limit. The Company’s management regularly monitors these institutions and believes that the potential for future loss is remote. The Company considers liquid investments with original or acquired maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nFinancial investments are classified as trading or available-for-sale.\nTrading financial investments represent financial investments held by Cboe Trading that retain the industry-specific accounting classification required for broker-dealers and marketable securities held in a rabbi trust for the Company’s non-qualified retirement and benefit plans. The investments held by the broker-dealer subsidiary are recorded at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses reflected within interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of income. The investments held in a rabbi trust are recorded at fair value with changes in unrealized gains or losses recorded within other income (expense) and the equal and offsetting charges in the related liability are recorded in compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nAvailable-for-sale financial investments are comprised of the financial investments not held by Cboe Trading, including highly liquid U.S. Treasury securities. Unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nInterest on financial investments, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is recognized as income when earned. Realized gains and losses on financial investments are calculated using the specific identification method and are included in interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nA decline in the fair value of any available-for-sale investment below carrying amount that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in an impairment to reduce the carrying amount to realizable value. To determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers all available information relevant to the collectability of the investment, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts when developing estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year-end, forecasted performance of the investee, and the general market condition in the geographic area or industry in which the investee operates.\nAccounts receivable are concentrated with the Company’s member firms and market data distributors and are carried at amortized cost. The Company nets transaction fees and liquidity payments for each member firm on a monthly basis and recognizes the total owed from a member firm as accounts receivable, net and the total owed to a member firm as accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. On a periodic basis, management evaluates the Company’s accounts receivable and records an allowance for expected credit losses using an aging schedule. The aging schedule applies loss rates based on historical loss information and, as deemed necessary, is adjusted for differences in the nature of the receivables that exist at the reporting date from the historical period. Due to the short-term nature of the accounts receivable, changes in future economic conditions are not expected to have a significant impact on the expected credit losses.\nThe accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for credit losses on the consolidated balance sheets and the associated losses are presented in other operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income.\n100\nProperty and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets, generally ranging from\nthree\nto\nseven years\n. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of leasehold improvements is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets.\nLong-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company bases this evaluation on such impairment indicators as the nature of the assets, the future economic benefit of the assets, any historical or future profitability measurements, as well as other external market conditions or factors that may be present. If such impairment indicators are present that would indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable, the Company determines whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flow analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. In the event of impairment, the Company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated value of the asset as measured using quoted market prices or, in the absence of quoted market prices, a discounted cash flow analysis.\nThe Company expenses software development costs as incurred during the preliminary project stage, while capitalizing costs incurred during the application development stage, which includes design, coding, installation and testing activities.\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of a business acquired. Goodwill is allocated to the Company’s reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of each reporting unit of the acquired company. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value may be impaired. The impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter using October 1\nst\ncarrying values, and if the fair value of the reporting unit is found to be less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded. The Company performed its 2020 annual goodwill impairment test and determined that\nno\nimpairment existed.\nIntangible assets, net, primarily include acquired trademarks and trade names, customer relationships, strategic alliance agreements, licenses and registrations and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized based on the discounted cash flow method applied over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets and are tested for impairment if certain events occur indicating that the carry value may be impaired.\nIntangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, usually concurrently with goodwill. Impairment exists if the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying amount, and in that case, an impairment loss is recorded. The Company performed its 2020 annual intangible assets impairment test using October 1, 2020 carrying values and determined that\nno\nimpairment existed.\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect as of each balance sheet date. Statements of income and cash flow amounts are translated using the average exchange rate during the period. The cumulative effects of translating the balance sheet accounts from the functional currency into the U.S. dollar at the applicable exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the balance sheet. Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded as other income, net in the consolidated statements of income. The Company’s operations in the United Kingdom, Amsterdam, Canada, Singapore, and Hong Kong are recorded in Pounds sterling, Euros, Canadian dollars, Singapore dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, respectively.\nDeferred taxes are recorded on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of\n101\nmanagement, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Also, interest and penalties expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision within the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company elected to account for global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore, have not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in the consolidated financial statements.\nFor further discussion related to revenue recognition of fees, such as transaction and clearing fees and liquidity payments, access and capacity fees, market data fees, and regulation transaction and Section 31 fees, see Note 4 (“Revenue Recognition”).\nConcentrations of Revenue and Liquidity Payments\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018,\nno\ncustomer accounted for more than\n15\n%\nof the Company’s total revenue.\nNo customer is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use the Company’s services. The loss of, or a significant reduction of, participation by these customers may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The\ntwo\nlargest clearing members clear the majority of the market-maker sides of transactions at all of the Company’s U.S. options exchanges. If either of these clearing members were to withdraw from the business of market-maker clearing and market-makers were unable to transfer to another clearing member, this could create significant disruption to the U.S. options markets, including Cboe’s.\nThe computation of basic earnings per share is calculated by reducing net income for the period by dividends paid or declared and undistributed net income for the period that are allocated to participating securities to arrive at net income allocated to common stockholders. Net income allocated to common stockholders is divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period to determine net income per share allocated to common stockholders.\nThe computation of diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income allocated to common stockholders by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus all additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect is calculated using the more dilutive of the two-class or treasury stock method.\nThe Company grants stock-based compensation to its employees through awards of restricted stock units. In connection with the acquisition of Bats, Bats previously awarded stock options and restricted stock awards. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation granted based on the grant-date fair value. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock-based compensation awards with graded vesting that have a service condition on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award.\nThe amount of stock-based compensation expense related to awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the fair value of Cboe Global Markets, Inc. common stock at the date of grant. The fair value is based on a current market-based transaction of the Company’s common stock. If a market-based transaction of the Company’s common stock is not available, then the fair value is based on an independent third-party valuation using equal weighting\n102\nof two valuation analysis techniques, discounted cash flows and valuation multiples observed from publicly traded companies in a similar industry.\nThe Company records identifiable assets, liabilities and goodwill acquired in a business combination at fair value at the acquisition date. Additionally, transaction-related costs are expensed in the period incurred.\nAll costs incurred to issue debt are capitalized as a contra-liability and amortized over the life of the debt using the interest method.\nThe Company generally accounts for investments using the measurement alternative when it owns less than 20% of the outstanding voting stock of a company, there is an absence of readily determinable fair value for the respective investment, and the Company has an inability to exercise significant influence over the investment based upon the respective ownership interests held. The Company recognizes dividend income when declared.\nIn general, the equity method of accounting is used when the Company owns 20% to 50% of the outstanding voting stock of a company and when it is able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of a company. For equity method investments, the Company records the pro-rata share of earnings or losses each period and records any dividends received as a reduction in the investment balance. The equity method investment is inclusive of other-than-temporary declines in value, recognized by the investee, who considers a variety of factors such as the earnings capacity of the investment and the fair value of the investment compared to its carrying amount. If the estimated fair value of the investment is less than the carrying amount and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value is recognized in the financial statements as an impairment.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. For arrangements where the Company is the lessee, operating leases are included in operating lease right of use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and non-current operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Company does not have any finance leases as of December 31, 2020.\nROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the lease liabilities, as the rate implicit in the Company’s leases are generally not reasonably determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate when the Company is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company also has lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The Company elected the practical expedient not to separate non-lease components from lease components for the Company’s leases. The Company elected to apply the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption in which ROU assets and lease liabilities are not recognized for short-term leases. For short-term operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLeases with an initial term of\n12 months\nor less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and the Company recognizes lease expense in facilities costs within the consolidated statements of income for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from\none\nto\nfive years\nor more, and some of which include the Company’s option to terminate the leases within\none year\n. When the implicit rate in the Company’s lease is not reasonably determinable, the Company applies an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\n103\nMargin deposits and clearing funds in the form of cash contributions by EuroCCP’s clearing participants where title has transferred to EuroCCP are included as current assets with equal and offsetting current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. These margin deposits and clearing funds are deposited with De Nederlandsche Bank (“DNB”), can only be used for specified EuroCCP operations, and fluctuate over time due to changes in deposit requirements. Certain non-cash margin deposits and clearing fund deposits, as well as interoperability fund deposits, are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, as EuroCCP does not take economic ownership of these balances. Cash held as margin deposits and clearing fund deposits may be invested at an approved bank in accordance with EuroCCP’s investment policy, and any interest or gain received, or loss incurred on invested funds is recorded in other revenue in the consolidated statements of income.\n3.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements – Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Credit Losses. This update replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in GAAP with a methodology that requires management to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets. This includes accounts receivable and notes receivable, which is included in other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The update also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. The forward-looking expected lifetime credit loss model generally will result in the earlier recognition of credit losses. For public entities, the update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective approach and did not restate comparative periods. Upon the adoption of the standard, the Company recognized an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for the estimate of current expected credit loss on financial instruments within the scope of the standard, including accounts receivable, net. Accounts receivable related to clearing operations are fully collateralized, which minimizes credit loss exposure. Based on the Company’s high turnover and collectability of accounts receivable, as well as the monthly billing process for the majority of revenue, there was not a significant variance in the recognized loss between the incurred loss impairment methodology under the prior standard and the expected lifetime credit loss model under this ASU. The financial instruments other than accounts receivable, net that are within the scope of the standard were not materially impacted by the standard. The impact to the consolidated balance sheet was immaterial in nature and there was no impact to the consolidated statements of income and cash flows.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This ASU removes certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value hierarchy, modifies existing disclosure requirements related to measurement uncertainty and adds new disclosure requirements. The new disclosure requirements include disclosing the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. For public entities, the update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2020 using the prospective approach, which did not result in a material impact to the consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements – Issued, not yet Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU removes certain income tax exceptions and modifies existing guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. For public entities, the update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company expects to adopt the update for the financial statements issued for the first quarter of 2021 and does not anticipate a material impact to the consolidated financial statements\n.\n104\n4.  REVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company’s main types of revenue contracts are:\n105\nAll revenue recognized in the income statement is considered to be revenue from contracts with customers.\nThe following table depicts the disaggregation of revenue according to product line and segment (in millions):\n​\nContract liabilities as of December 31, 2020 primarily represent prepayments of transaction fees and certain access and capacity and market data fees to the Exchanges.\nThe revenue recognized from contract liabilities and the remaining balance is shown below (in millions):\n5.  ACQUISITIONS\nOn February 3, 2020, the Company purchased Hanweck Associates, LLC (“Hanweck”) and the assets of FT Providers, LLC (“FT Options”). Hanweck and FT Options are both providers of risk analytics market data and included in the Company’s Options segment. On June 1, 2020, the Company purchased the assets of Trade Alert, LLC (“Trade Alert”), a real-time alerts and order flow analysis service provider included in the Company’s Options segment. On August\n106\n4, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of MATCHNow, one of the largest equities ATSs in Canada, which is included in the Company’s North American Equities segment. Of these acquisitions’ aggregate purchase price,\n$\n100.7\nmillion was allocated to goodwill,\n$\n59.0\nmillion was allocated to intangible assets, and\n$\n2.2\nmillion was allocated to working capital. In connection with these acquisitions, approximately\n$\n32.7\nmillion in contingent consideration (in the aggregate) related to future financial performance of the acquired business or developmental milestones has been recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These amounts represent the allocation of the purchase price and are subject to revision during the remainder of the measurement period, a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date. See below for further discussion of intangible assets acquired.\nOn July 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining\n80\n%\ninterest in EuroCCP, a pan-European equities clearinghouse, which is included in the Company’s European Equities segment. Of the acquisition’s purchase price of the remaining consideration,\n$\n32.3\nmillion was allocated to intangible assets and\n$\n56.0\nmillion was allocated to working capital upon consolidation. Prior to signing the agreement to acquire the remaining\n80\n%\nof EuroCCP, the Company agreed on the purchase price with the other shareholders, as they were looking to liquidate their investments in EuroCCP. That agreement gave way to a\n$\n32.6\nmillion bargain purchase gain, which is included in other non-operating income, net in the consolidated statement of income. These amounts represent the allocation of the purchase price and are subject to revision during the remainder of the measurement period, a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, EuroCCP put in place a committed revolving credit facility of up to\n€\n1.5\nbillion, see Note 13 (“Debt”) for more information. See below for further discussion of intangible assets acquired.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company purchased BIDS Holdings (“BIDS”). BIDS Holdings owns BIDS Trading, LP, a registered broker-dealer and the operator of the BIDS ATS, the largest block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S. The alternative trading system operated by BIDS is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof. The acquisition of BIDS provided the Company with a foothold in the off-exchange segment of the U.S. equities market, which allowed the Company’s presence in the North American equities segment to expand. Of the acquisitions purchase price,\n$\n100.5\nmillion was allocated to goodwill,\n$\n156.4\nmillion was allocated to intangible assets, and\n$\n22.8\nmillion was allocated to working capital. These amounts represent the allocation of the purchase price and are subject to revision during the remainder of the measurement period, a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date. See below for further discussion of intangible assets acquired. The acquisition was funded by the Company’s most recent debt issuance, which the Company secured on December 9, 2020. See Note 13 (“Debt”) for a discussion of debt agreements.\nThe following table presents the details of intangible assets at the dates of acquisition. All acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method.\n​\n​\nAcquisition-related costs relate to acquisitions and other strategic opportunities, including the Merger. The Company expensed\n$\n45.3\nmillion of acquisition-related costs during the year ended December 31, 2020, which included\n$\n22.1\nmillion of professional fees,\n$\n15.1\nmillion of impairment charges related to investments, and other expenses and\n$\n8.1\nmillion of impairment charges related to facilities. These acquisition-related expenses are included in acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company expensed\n$\n48.5\nmillion of acquisition-related costs during the year ended December 31, 2019 that included\n$\n19.3\nmillion of compensation-related costs,\n$\n10.5\nmillion of impairment of goodwill charges,\n$\n6.1\nmillion of impairment of facilities charges,\n$\n4.5\nmillion loss on disposal of data processing software,\n$\n3.9\nmillion of professional fees,\n$\n2.2\nmillion of termination fees related to an assigned lease agreement, and\n$\n2.0\nmillion of general and administrative expenses. These acquisition-related expenses are included in acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company expensed\n$\n30.0\nmillion of acquisition-related costs during the year ended December 31, 2018 that included\n$\n23.6\nmillion of compensation-related costs,\n$\n2.7\nmillion of stock-based compensation,\n$\n3.0\nmillion of professional fees, and\n$\n0.6\nmillion of general and administrative expenses. These acquisition-related expenses are included in acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statements of income.\n​\n​\n107\n6.  INVESTMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company's investments were comprised of the following (in millions)\n:\n​\nEquity Method Investments\nEquity method investments include investments in Signal Trading Systems, LLC, a\n50\n%\njoint venture with FlexTrade System, Inc. to develop and market a multi-asset front-end order entry system, and until the third quarter of 2020, EuroCCP, a Dutch domiciled clearinghouse. EuroCCP is one of\nthree\ninteroperable central counterparties, or CCPs, used to clear trades conducted on Cboe Europe Limited’s and Cboe Europe NL’s markets. As of June 30, 2020, Cboe Europe Limited owned\n20\n%\nof EuroCCP and was able to exercise significant influence over the entity as an equal shareholder with\nfour\nother investors. The Company acquired the remaining\n80\n%\ninterest in EuroCCP on July 1, 2020, see Note 5 (“Acquisitions”) for more information. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company accounts for EuroCCP as a wholly-owned subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the year, the Company commenced an initiative to migrate PULSe, the multi-asset front-end order entry system operated by Signal, and its related activity to Silexx, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. PULSe was decommissioned as of December 31, 2020, and the joint venture with FlexTrade is anticipated to be terminated in the first quarter of 2021. Given the more-likely-than-not expectation that Signal was to be disposed of as of December 31, 2020, the Company concluded that the remaining investment in Signal had no future economic value and was written off in the amount of\n$\n11.0\nmillion as of December 31, 2020. The loss related to the write-off was included within acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nOther Equity Investments\nThe carrying amount of other equity method investments totaled $\n40.7\nmillion and $\n38.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company accounts for these investments using the measurement alternative given the absence of readily determinable fair values for the respective investments and due to the Company’s inability to exercise significant influence over the investments based upon the respective ownership interests held. As of December 31, 2020, other equity investments primarily reflect a\n20\n%\ninvestment in OCC and minority investments in American Financial Exchange, LLC (“AFX”), CurveGlobal, Cboe Vest Financial Group, Inc. (“Vest”), Eris Exchange Holdings, LLC, and Eris Digital Holdings, LLC.\nIn January 2016, the Company, through its subsidiary Cboe Vest, LLC (“Cboe Vest”), acquired a majority of the outstanding equity of Vest, an asset investment manager focused on Target Outcome Investment strategies. The purchase price consisted of\n$\n18.9\nmillion in cash, reflecting payments of\n$\n14.9\nmillion to former stockholders and\n$\n4.0\nmillion to Vest for newly issued shares, and represented an ownership interest of\n60\n%\nresulting in the consolidation of Vest operations. The remaining\n40\n%\nnoncontrolling interest was held by the remaining Vest stockholders. The remaining Vest stockholders had a put option that could have been exercised to Vest and Vest had a call option that could have been exercised to the remaining stockholders. The put and\ncall options\ncould have been exercised after\nfive years\nthough they could have been accelerated by certain employment-related actions. The combination of the noncontrolling interest\n108\nand a redemption feature resulted in a redeemable noncontrolling interest, which was classified outside of permanent equity on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s ownership interest decreased in August 2019 which resulted in the deconsolidation of Vest operations and the elimination of the redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nIn May 2020, Eris Exchange Holdings, LLC completed a restructuring transaction to spin out Eris Digital Holdings, LLC into a stand-alone entity. The restructuring qualifies as an exchange of ownership interest, though it required no additional consideration exchanged to execute the exchange of units. The restructuring did not result in a change in number of units owned by the Company or a substantial change in the Company’s ownership interest percentage.\nNo\ngain or loss is recognized as a result of the restructuring. The Company’s investment in Eris Digital Holdings, LLC is included within “Other equity investments” in the above table.\nIn August 2020, the Company recorded within acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statements of income an impairment charge of\n$\n4.1\nmillion on its investment in AFX based on management’s assessment of the fair value of the investment.\n7.  FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS\nThe Company’s financial investments with original or acquired maturities longer than three months, but that mature in less than one year from the balance sheet date and any money market funds that are considered cash and cash equivalents are classified as current assets. The Company’s marketable securities are also classified as current assets within financial investments.\nThe Company’s financial investments are summarized as follows (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n8.  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n​\nDepreciation expense using the straight-line method was\n$\n26.8\nmillion,\n$\n24.5\nmillion and\n$\n25.1\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs a result of the Merger, there is a reduction in employee workspace needed in Chicago, which led to the decision to market for sale the headquarters location. The Company classified the associated land, building, and certain furniture and\n109\nequipment of the headquarters location as held for sale, performed an impairment assessment, and ceased depreciation effective May 1, 2019, as the Company anticipated selling the property held for sale in less than twelve months. As of December 31, 2020, the headquarters location remains on the market for sale and management’s intent to sell the property is unchanged, and the total value of the property classified as property held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet was\n$\n13.0\nmillion. As a result of an evaluation of the headquarters location’s classification as held for sale during the second quarter of 2020, an impairment assessment was performed and an additional impairment charge of\n$\n8.1\nmillion was recorded in acquisition-related costs within the Options segment in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The impact of ceasing depreciation of the property held for sale did not result in a material impact to the consolidated financial statements\n.\n9.  CREDIT LOSSES\nCurrent expected credit losses are estimated for accounts receivable and notes receivable. The notes receivable included within other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets primarily relate to the consolidated audit trail (“CAT”), which involves the creation of an audit trail that strives to enhance regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in the U.S. markets through a phased implementation. While the funding of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both SROs (which includes the Exchanges) and industry members, until fee filings associated with the funding model are approved by the SEC, the funding to date has solely been provided by the SROs. The funding by the SROs has been done in exchange for promissory notes, which are expected to be repaid once such industry member fees are collected. Until those fees are collected, the SROs may continue to incur additional significant costs. The allowance for notes receivable credit losses associated with the CAT is calculated using a probability of default methodology. Due to the potential changes in the CAT funding model, an additional\n$\n6.7\nmillion was recorded to the allowance for notes receivable for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accounts receivable represent amounts due from the Company’s member firms. The allowance for accounts receivable credit losses is calculated using an aging schedule. The following represents the changes in allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n​\n​\n​\n10.  OTHER ASSETS, NET\nOther assets, net consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n​\nAmortization expense related to data processing software was\n$\n6.9\nmillion,\n$\n13.5\nmillion, and\n$\n18.9\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\n.\n110\n11.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET\nThe following table presents the details of goodwill by segment (in millions)\n:\n​\nGoodwill has been allocated to specific reporting units for purposes of impairment testing - Options, North American Equities, European Equities and Global FX.\nNo\ngoodwill has been allocated to Futures. Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired.\nThe following table presents the details of the intangible assets (in millions):\n​\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, amortization expense was\n$\n124.8\nmillion, $\n138.6\nmillion and\n$\n160.0\nmillion, respectively. The estimated future amortization expense is\n$\n123.7\nmillion for 2021,\n$\n110.7\nmillion for 2022,\n$\n99.4\nmillion for 2023,\n$\n77.8\nmillion for 2024, and\n$\n67.2\nmillion for 2025.\nThe following tables present the categories of intangible assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n​\n111\n​\n​\n​\n12.  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n13.  DEBT\nThe Company’s debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n​\nOn July 28, 2020, the Company drew down on the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined below) in the amount of\n$\n70\nmillion. On December 16, 2020, the Company repaid all of the\n$\n70\nmillion of outstanding indebtedness under the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement by using a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of\n$\n500\nmillion in aggregate principal amount of the\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes (as defined below).\n​\nOn December 16, 2020, the Company repaid\n$\n155\nmillion of outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) by using a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of\n$\n500\nmillion in aggregate principal amount of the\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes (as defined below).\n​\nTerm Loan Agreement\nOn March 22, 2018, the Company, as borrower, entered into a new Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A. (“Bank of America”), as administrative agent and initial lender, and the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time party thereto as lenders. Bank of America also acted as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner with respect to the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of\n$\n300\nmillion. The proceeds of the loan under the Term\n112\nLoan Agreement were used to repay the\n$\n300\nmillion of outstanding indebtedness under the prior term loan agreement entered into on December 15, 2016.\nLoans under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) periodically fixed for an interest period (as selected by the Company) of one, two, three or six months plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from\n1.00\npercent per annum to\n1.50\npercent per annum or (ii) a daily floating rate based on the agent’s prime rate (subject to certain minimums based upon the federal funds effective rate or LIBOR) plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from\nzero\npercent per annum to\n0.50\npercent per annum. The Company was required to pay an up-front fee of\n0.05\npercent to the agent for the entry into the Term Loan Agreement.\nThe Term Loan Agreement, which matures on December 15, 2021, contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants for facilities of its type, including financial covenants, events of default, including cross-defaults from the Company’s other indebtedness, and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders thereunder. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company’s subsidiaries and fundamental changes, subject to certain exceptions in each case. The financial covenants require the Company to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than\n4.00\nto 1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than\n3.50\nto 1.00. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\nOn May 29, 2020, the Company amended the Term Loan Agreement to, among other items, (i) permit liens on assets of the EuroCCP settlement and clearing business that secures indebtedness incurred in support of its settlement and clearing activities, and permit the Company’s subsidiaries to incur such indebtedness, provided that such amounts are repaid within 35 days; and (ii) provide that the LIBOR, as used in the Term Loan Agreement, may be succeeded by one or more secured overnight financing rates (“SOFR”) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then-existing convention for similar agreements\nSenior Notes\nOn January 12, 2017, the Company entered into an indenture (the “Indenture”), by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, in connection with the issuance of\n$\n650\nmillion aggregate principal amount of the Company’s\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes due 2027 (\"\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes\"). The form and terms of the\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes were established pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate, dated as of January 12, 2017, supplementing the Indenture. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes to fund, in part, the Merger, including the payment of related fees and expenses and the repayment of Bats’ existing indebtedness, and the remainder for general corporate purposes. The\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes mature on January 12, 2027 and bear interest at the rate of\n3.650\n%\nper annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 12 and July 12 of each year, commencing July 12, 2017.\nOn December 15, 2020, the Company issued\n$\n500\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes due 2030 (\"\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes\" and, together with the\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes, the \"Senior Notes\"). The form and terms of the\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes were established pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate, dated as of December 15, 2020, supplementing the Indenture. The Company used the net proceeds from the\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes to finance the acquisition of BIDS Trading, repay a portion of amounts outstanding under the term loan facility and all outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of future acquisitions or the repayment of other outstanding indebtedness. The\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes mature on December 15, 2030 and bear interest at the rate of\n1.625\n%\nper annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2021.\nThe Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of the Company’s other existing and future unsecured, senior indebtedness, but are effectively junior to the Company’s secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and will be structurally subordinated to the secured and unsecured indebtedness of the Company’s subsidiaries.\nThe Company has the option to redeem some or all of the Senior Notes, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable Officer’s Certificate. The Company may also be required to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as such term is defined in\n113\nthe applicable Officer’s Certificate) at a repurchase price equal to\n101\n%\nof the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes to be repurchased.\nIndenture\nUnder the Indenture, the Company may issue debt securities, which includes the Senior Notes and the\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes, at any time and from time to time, in one or more series without limitation on the aggregate principal amount. The Indenture governing the\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes and the\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes contains customary restrictions, including a limitation that restricts the Company’s ability and the ability of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries to create or incur secured debt. Such Indenture also limits certain sale and leaseback transactions and contains customary events of default. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nOn December 21, 2020, the Company, as borrower, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement, as defined below, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and as swing line lender, certain lenders named therein (the “Revolving Lenders”), BOFA Securities, Inc., as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner and certain syndication agents named therein (\"Syndication Agents\").\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured\n$\n250\nmillion\nthree-year\nrevolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) that includes a\n$\n25\nmillion swing line sub-facility. The Company may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to\n$\n100\nmillion, for a total of\n$\n350\nmillion. Subject to specified conditions, the Company may designate\none\nor more of its subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the Revolving Credit Agreement provided that the Company guarantees all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020,\nno\nsubsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers.\nFunds borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including the making of any acquisitions the Company may pursue in the ordinary course of its business. As of December 31, 2020,\nno\nborrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2020,\n$\n250\nmillion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nLoans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from\n.875\npercent per annum to\n1.50\npercent per annum or (ii) a daily floating rate based on the agent’s prime rate (subject to certain minimums based upon the federal funds effective rate or LIBOR) plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from\nzero\npercent per annum to\n0.50\npercent per annum. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a mechanism to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate that includes the forward-looking term rate for any interest period that is based on the SOFR published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as may be adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nSubject to certain conditions stated in the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company and any subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on December 21, 2023, unless the commitments are terminated earlier, either at the request of the Company or, if an event of default occurs, by the Revolving Lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events). The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants for facilities of its type, including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the Revolving Lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company’s subsidiaries and fundamental changes, subject to certain exceptions in each case. The financial covenants require the Company to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than\n4.00\nto 1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than\n3.50\nto 1.00; provided that the consolidated leverage ratio may, subject to certain\n114\ntriggering events set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement, be increased to\n4.00\nto 1.00 for four consecutive fiscal quarters. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\nPrior Revolving Credit Agreement\nOn December 15, 2016, the Company, as borrower, entered into a syndicated Credit Agreement (the “Prior Revolving Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and as swing line lender, as well as certain lenders named therein (the “Prior Revolving Lenders”).\nThe Prior Revolving Credit Agreement provided for a senior unsecured\n$\n150\nmillion\nfive-year\nrevolving credit facility (the “Prior Revolving Credit Facility”) that included a\n$\n25\nmillion swing line sub-facility. The Company may have also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increased the commitments under the Prior Revolving Credit Facility by up to\n$\n100\nmillion, for a total of\n$\n250\nmillion. Subject to specified conditions, the Company designated\none\nor more of its subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement provided that the Company guaranteed all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries.\nFunds borrowed under the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement may have been used to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes.\nLoans under the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement bore interest, at the Company’s option, at either (i) LIBOR periodically fixed for an interest period (as selected by the Company) of one, two, three or six months plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from\n1.00\npercent per annum to\n1.75\npercent per annum or (ii) a daily floating rate based on the prime rate (subject to certain minimums based upon the federal funds effective rate or LIBOR) plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from\nzero\npercent per annum to\n0.75\npercent per annum.\nThe commercial terms of the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement are substantially similar to the Revolving Credit Agreement, other than interest rates and the maturity date. On May 29, 2020, the Company amended the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement to, among other items, (i) permit liens on assets of the EuroCCP settlement and clearing business that secures indebtedness incurred in support of its settlement and clearing activities, and permit the Company’s subsidiaries to incur such indebtedness, provided that such amounts are repaid within\n35 days\n; and (ii) provide that the LIBOR, as used in the Prior Revolving Credit Agreement, may be succeeded by one or more SOFR published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then-existing convention for similar agreements.\nEuroCCP Credit Facility\nOn July 1, 2020, EuroCCP, as borrower, the Company, as guarantor, entered into a Facility Agreement (the “Facility”) with Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Designated Activity Company, as co-ordinator, facility agent, lender, sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, Citibank N.A., as security agent, and certain other lenders named therein.\nThe Facility provides for a\n€\n1.5\nbillion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility (i) that is available to be drawn by EuroCCP (as borrower) towards (a) financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through EuroCCP’s clearing system and (b) financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of EuroCCP incurred in the operation of its clearing system and (ii) under which the scheduled interest and fees on borrowings (but not the principal amount of any borrowings) are guaranteed by the Company. Subject to certain conditions, EuroCCP is able to increase the commitments under the Facility by up to\n€\n500\nmillion, to a total of\n€\n2.0\nbillion.\nBorrowings under the Facility are secured by cash, eligible government bonds and eligible equity assets deposited by EuroCCP into secured accounts. In addition, EuroCCP must ensure that at all times the aggregate of (a) each clearing participant’s contribution to the relevant clearing fund, (b) each clearing participant’s margin amount and (c) any cash equities purchased using the proceeds of the assets described in (a) and (b), less the amount of any such clearing participant contribution, margin amount or cash equities which have been transferred to (or secured in favor of) any provider of settlement or custody services to EuroCCP, is not less than\n€\n500\nmillion. As of December 31, 2020,\nno\nborrowings were outstanding under the Facility. Accordingly, at December 31, 2020,\n€\n1.5\nbillion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Facility.\n115\nBorrowings under the Facility’s revolving loans and non-U.S. dollar swingline loans bear interest at the relevant floating base rate plus a margin of\n1.75\npercent per annum and (subject to certain conditions) borrowings under the Facility’s U.S. dollar swingline loans bear interest as the higher of the relevant agent’s prime commercial lending rate for U.S. dollars and\n0.5\npercent per annum over the federal funds effective rate. A commitment fee of\n0.30\npercent per annum is payable on the unused and uncalled amount of the Facility during the availability period.\nSubject to certain conditions stated in the Facility, EuroCCP may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the Facility at any time during the term of the Facility. The Facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on\n364 days\nfrom the date of the agreement, unless the commitments are terminated earlier, either at the request of EuroCCP or, if an event of default occurs, by the Lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events).\nThe Facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants for facilities of its type, including events of default of the Company and EuroCCP and indemnification provisions in favor of the Lenders. In particular, the covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens by EuroCCP and its subsidiaries, and an event of default will be triggered if EuroCCP ceases its business, subject to certain exceptions in each case. There is also a requirement for the net worth of (a) the Company to be no less than\n$\n1.75\nbillion on the date of each drawdown and delivery of compliance certificates and (b) EuroCCP to be the higher of\n€\n24\nmillion and any such amount required for EuroCCP to meet minimum liquidity regulations under applicable regulation at all times. At December 31, 2020, the Company and EuroCCP were in compliance with these covenants.\nLoan and Notes Payments and Contractual Interest\nThe future expected loan repayments related to the Term Loan Agreement and the Senior Notes as of December 31, 2020 are as follows (in millions):\n​\nInterest expense recognized on the Term Loan Agreement, the Senior Notes, and the Revolving Credit Agreement is included in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of income. The Company is also obligated to pay commitment fees under the terms of the Facility and Revolving Credit Agreement which are also included in interest expense, net.\nInterest expense, net recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n116\n14.  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET\nThe following represents the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component (in millions):\n​\n​\n15.  CLEARING OPERATIONS\nEuroCCP is a European equities central counterparty that provides post-trade services to stock exchanges, MTFs and for over-the-counter (“OTC”) equities trades. EuroCCP clears equities from\neighteen\nEuropean markets and from the United States, as well as Depositary Receipts, ETFs, and exchange traded currencies (“ETCs”). Through a novation process, EuroCCP becomes the buyer for every seller and the seller for every buyer, thereby protecting clearing participants from counterparty risk and allowing the settlement of trades in the event of a clearing participant default.\nEuroCCP only assumes the guarantor role if it has an equal and offsetting claim against a clearing participant. During the period from July 1, 2020, the date the Company acquired EuroCCP, through December 31, 2020, there were no events of default for which a liability is required to be recognized in accordance with GAAP.\nClearing Participant Deposits\nEuroCCP generally requires all clearing participants to deposit collateral to help mitigate EuroCCP’s exposure to credit risk in the event that a clearing participant fails to meet a financial or contractual obligation.\nMargin Deposits\nMargin deposits, which are predominately in the form of cash and cash equivalents, are deposits made by each clearing participant to EuroCCP to cover some or all of the credit risk of its failure to fulfill its obligations in the trade. EuroCCP maintains and manages all cash deposits related to margin deposits. Substantially all risks and rewards of margin deposit ownership, including net interest income, belong to EuroCCP and are recorded in other revenue on the consolidated statements of income. In the event of a default, EuroCCP can access the defaulting participant’s margin deposits to cover the defaulting participant’s losses. For more information, see “Default and Liquidity Waterfalls” below.\nClearing Funds\nThe clearing fund mutualizes the risk of default among all clearing participants. The entire clearing fund is available to cover potential losses in the event that the margin deposits and the clearing fund deposits of a defaulting clearing participant are inadequate to fulfill that clearing participant’s outstanding financial obligations. In the event of a default, EuroCCP is generally required to liquidate the defaulting clearing participant’s open positions. To the extent that the positions remain open, EuroCCP is required to assume the defaulting clearing participant’s obligations related to the open positions. Clearing participants are required to make contributions to the clearing fund that are proportional to their risk exposure in the form of cash or non-cash contributions, which generally consist of highly liquid securities.\nInteroperability Fund\nEuroCCP has entered into interoperable arrangements with\ntwo\nother central counterparties (“CCPs”). Under these arrangements, margin is required to and from the other CCPs and is deposited in an interoperability fund. The interoperability fund consists of collateral pledged by EuroCCP to the other interoperable CCPs, to cover margin calls EuroCCP received from other interoperable CCPs. For EuroCCP, the collateral pledged by the clearing participants is maintained in an interoperability fund designated account. EuroCCP does not have any economic interest or ownership in the collateral; therefore, these balances are not included in the consolidated balance sheet.\n​\n117\nAs of December 31, 2020, total clearing participant contributions were as follows\n:\n​\n​\nDefault and Liquidity Waterfalls\nThe default waterfall is the priority order in which the capital resources are expected to be utilized in the event of a default where the defaulting clearing participant’s collateral would not be sufficient to cover the cost to liquidate its portfolio. If a default occurs and the defaulting clearing participant’s collateral, including margin deposits, clearing fund deposits, and pledged assets into the interoperability fund, are depleted, then additional capital is utilized in the following order:\nIn addition to the default waterfall, the liquidity waterfall is the priority order in which the liquidity resources are expected to be utilized for EuroCCP’s ordinary course business operations and in situations when additional liquidity resources and liquidity measures may be activated in case of a potential liquidity shortfall. Liquidity, intraday or overnight, is mainly required for securities settlement. In ordinary course business circumstances, liquidity resources include the collateral directly deposited with EuroCCP, FX swap arrangements, and reverse repurchase agreements, as well as the use of the Facility\n.\n16.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\nFair value is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid upon the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including the Company’s own credit risk.\nThe Company applied FASB ASC 820\n—\nFair Value Measurement and Disclosure\n, which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities by defining fair value and establishing the framework for measuring fair value. ASC 820 applies to financial and nonfinancial instruments that are measured and reported on a fair value basis. The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:\n118\nThe Company has included a tabular disclosure for financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following tables present the Company’s fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n​\n​\nThe following is a description of the Company’s valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nFinancial Investments\n​\nFinancial investments consist of highly liquid U.S. Treasury securities and marketable securities held in a rabbi trust for the Company’s non-qualified retirement and benefit plans, also referred to as deferred compensation plan assets. The deferred compensation plan assets have an equal and offsetting deferred compensation plan liability based on the value of the deferred compensation plan assets. These securities are valued by obtaining feeds from a number of live data sources, including active market makers and inter-dealer brokers and therefore categorized as Level 1. See Note 18 (“Employee Benefit Plan”) for more information.\nContingent Consideration Liability\nIn connection with the acquisitions of Hanweck and MATCHNow, as well as the acquisition of assets of FT Options and Trade Alert, the Company entered into contingent consideration arrangements with the former owners. The total fair value of the liabilities at December 31, 2020 was\n$\n32.7\nmillion. That value is based on the Company’s estimate of the likelihood that certain performance targets in the respective acquisition agreements are expected to be accomplished. Because the fair value measurements relating to the contingent consideration liabilities are subject to management judgment, measurement uncertainty is inherent in the valuation of the contingent consideration liabilities as of the reporting date. Based on the recorded balance of the liabilities, any measurement uncertainty related to this Level 3 measurement is immaterial as of December 31, 2020.\n119\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nCertain assets, such as goodwill and intangible assets, are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. For goodwill, the process involves using a market approach and income approach (using discounted estimated cash flows) to determine the fair value of each reporting unit on a stand-alone basis. That fair value is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including its recorded goodwill. In connection with the annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles, impairment is considered to have occurred if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than the carrying amount of the reporting unit. For the intangible assets, the process also involves using a discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of each intangible asset. Impairment is considered to have occurred if the fair value of the intangible asset is lower than its carrying amount. These measurements are considered Level 3 and these assets are recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values that are valued using the measurement alternative are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. See Note 6 (“Investments”) for more information.\nProperty held for sale as of December 31, 2020 was measured at fair value, less selling costs at December 31, 2020. See Note 8 (“Property and Equipment, Net”) for more information on property held for sale.\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table presents the Company’s fair value hierarchy for certain assets and liabilities held by the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n​\n​\nCertain financial assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income tax receivable, accounts payable and Section 31 fees payable, are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, but the carrying values approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature.\nDebt\nThe debt balance consists of fixed rate, Senior Notes and a floating rate, Term Loan Agreement. The fair values of the Senior Notes were classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy and were estimated using prevailing market quotes. The fair value of the Term Loan Agreement approximates the carrying amount and is considered a Level 2 measurement.\n120\nAt December 31, 2020, the fair values of the Company’s debt obligations were as follows:\n​\n​\nInformation on Level 3 Financial Liabilities\nThe following table sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 financial liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n17.  SEGMENT REPORTING\nThe Company reports\nfive\nbusiness segments: Options, North American Equities, Futures, European Equities, and Global FX, which is reflective of how the Company's chief operating decision-maker reviews and operates the business, as discussed in Note 1 (“Nature of Operations”). Segment performance is primarily evaluated based on operating income (loss). The Company’s chief operating decision-maker does not use segment-level assets or income and expenses below operating income (loss) as key performance metrics; therefore, such information is not presented below. The Company has aggregated all of its corporate costs, as well as other business ventures, within the Corporate Items and Eliminations totals based on the decision that those activities should not be used to evaluate the operating performance of the segments; however, operating expenses that relate to activities of a specific segment have been allocated to that segment.\nOptions.\nThe Options segment includes listed options on market indices (“index options”), as well as on the stocks of individual corporations (“equity options”) and options on ETPs, such as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and exchange-traded notes (“ETNs”), which are “multi-listed” options and listed on a non-exclusive basis. These options trade on Cboe Options, C2 Options, BZX Options, and EDGX Options, all U.S. national security exchanges. Cboe Options is the Company’s primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on the Cboe Options trading floor in Chicago. There was a temporary suspension of open outcry trading between March 13, 2020 and June 14, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. C2 Options, BZX Options, and EDGX Options are all-electronic options exchanges, and typically operate with different market models and fee structures than Cboe Options. The Options segment also includes applicable market data revenue generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary options market data, index licensing, and access and capacity services.\nNorth American Equities (formerly U.S. Equities)\n.\nThe North American Equities segment includes listed U.S. equities and ETP transaction services that occur on fully electronic exchanges owned and operated by BZX Equities, BYX Equities, EDGX Equities, and EDGA Equities and Canadian equities and other transaction services that occur on or through the MATCHNow ATS. This segment was previously referred to as the U.S. Equities segment, but has been updated as a result of the acquisition of MATCHNow, which provides Canadian equities and other transaction services. In\n121\naddition, in connection with the closing of the acquisition of BIDS Trading, starting January 1, 2021, this segment also includes equities transactions that occur on the BIDS Trading platforms. The North American Equities segment also includes ETP listings on BZX, the Cboe Global Markets, Inc. common stock listing, applicable market data revenue generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary equities market data, routing services, access and capacity services and advertising activity from ETF.com.\nFutures.\nThe Futures segment includes transaction service provided by the Company’s fully electronic futures exchange, CFE, which includes offerings for trading VIX futures and other futures products, the licensing of proprietary market data, as well as access and capacity services\n.\nEuropean Equities.\nThe European Equities segment includes the pan-European listed equities transaction services, ETPs, exchange traded commodities, and international depository receipts that are hosted on MTFs operated by Cboe Europe Equities. It also includes the ETP listings business on RMs and clearing activities of EuroCCP. Cboe Europe Equities operates lit and dark books, a periodic auctions book, and a Large-in-Scale (“LIS”) trading negotiation facility. Cboe NL, launched in October 2019, operates similar business functionality to that offered by Cboe Europe, and provides for trading only in European Economic Area symbols. Cboe Europe Equities also includes revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.\nGlobal FX.\nThe Global FX segment includes institutional FX trading services that occur on the Cboe FX fully electronic trading platform, non-deliverable forward FX transactions (“NDFs”) offered for execution on Cboe SEF and Cboe Swiss, as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.\nSummarized financial data of reportable segments was as follows (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n18.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN\nEmployees are eligible to participate in the Cboe Options SMART Plan (“SMART Plan”). The SMART Plan is a defined contribution plan, which is qualified under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k). In addition, eligible employees may participate in the Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan, Executive Retirement Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan. Effective January 1, 2017, the Executive Retirement Plan is closed to new executive officers and employees. Each plan is a defined contribution plan that is non-qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. The Deferred Compensation Plan assets, held in a rabbi trust, are subject to the claims of general creditors of the Company and totaled\n$\n24.5\nmillion at December 31, 2020. Although the value of the plans are recorded in financial investments on the consolidated balance sheets, there are equal and offsetting liabilities in other non-current liabilities. The investment results of these plans have no impact on net income as the investment results are recorded in equal amounts to both other expense, net and compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of income. The Company contributed\n$\n10.5\nmillion,\n$\n11.3\nmillion, and\n$\n12.4\nmillion to the defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. This expense is included in compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of income.\nFor employees of Cboe Europe Limited, the Company contributes to an employee-selected stakeholder contribution plan. The Company’s contribution amounted to\n$\n0.8\nmillion,\n$\n0.7\nmillion, and\n$\n0.4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. This expense is included in compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of income.\nFor employees of EuroCCP, the Company contributes to an employee selected stakeholder contribution plan. The Company’s contribution amounted to\n$\n0.8\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020. This expense is included in compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of income.\n122\nFollowing the Company’s acquisition of MATCHNow, Cboe elected to establish a Cboe Canadian Retirement Plan which is available to all Canadian Cboe employees, and now includes BIDS employees. The Cboe Canadian Retirement Plan was implemented with an effective date of January 1, 2021. The Cboe Canadian Retirement Plan is a defined contribution plan, delivered by Mercer and Desjardins Financial Security Life Insurance Company. It features a registered retirement savings plan (“RRSP”). BIDS U.S. employees participate in the SMART Plan, effective as of January 1, 2021.\n19.  REGULATORY CAPITAL\nAs a broker dealer registered with the SEC, Cboe Trading and BIDS Trading are subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule (“Rule 15c3-1”), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined therein. The SEC’s requirement also provides that equity capital may not be withdrawn or a cash dividend paid if certain minimum net capital requirements are not met. Cboe Trading and BIDS compute the net capital requirements under the basic method provided for in Rule 15c3-1.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Cboe Trading is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of\n6.67\n%\nof aggregate indebtedness items, as defined, or\n$\n0.1\nmillion. At December 31, 2020, Cboe Trading had net capital of\n$\n15.0\nmillion, which was\n$\n13.9\nmillion in excess of its required net capital of\n$\n1.1\nmillion.\nAs of December 31, 2020, BIDS Trading is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of\n6.67\n%\nof aggregate indebtedness items, as defined, or\n$\n0.1\nmillion. At December 31, 2020 BIDS had net capital of\n$\n13.6\nmillion, which was\n$\n13.5\nmillion in excess of its required net capital of\n$\n0.1\nmillion.\nAs entities regulated by the FCA, Cboe Europe is subject to the Financial Resource Requirement (“FRR”) and Cboe Chi-X Europe is subject to the Capital Resources Requirement (“CRR”). As a RIE, Cboe Europe computes its FRR in accordance with its Financial Risk Assessment, as agreed by the FCA. This FRR was\n$\n24.0\nmillion at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, Cboe Europe had capital in excess of its required FRR of\n$\n28.8\nmillion.\nIn accordance with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive of the FCA requirements, Cboe Chi X Europe computes its CRR as the greater of the base requirement of\n$\n0.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, or the summation of the credit risk, market risk and fixed overheads requirements, as defined. As of December 31, 2020, Cboe Chi X Europe had\n$\n0.3\nmillion capital in excess of its required CRR. Cboe Chi-X Europe Limited is currently dormant having ceased offering its routing service in November 2018.\nOn March 8, 2019, Cboe Europe NL received approval from the Dutch Ministry of Finance to operate a RM, a MTF, and an approved publication arrangement in the Netherlands. As a RM, Cboe Europe NL is subject to minimum capital requirements, as established by the Dutch Ministry of Finance in the license of March 8, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the minimum capital requirement calculated in accordance with the license was\n$\n5.3\nmillion. At December 31, 2020, Cboe Europe NL had capital in excess of its requirement of\n$\n1.4\nmillion.\nOn April 1, 2014, EuroCCP was granted authorization under European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) by the National Competent Authority, DNB. EuroCCP is required by the EMIR, to maintain a minimum amount of capital to reflect an estimate of the capital required to wind down or restructure the activities of the clearinghouse, cover operational, legal and business risks and to reserve capital to meet credit, counterparty and market risks not covered by the clearing participants’ collateral and clearing funds. As of December 31, 2020, EuroCCP’s net capital was\n$\n48.2\nmillion, which was\n$\n17.2\nmillion in excess of its EMIR capital requirement of\n$\n31.0\nmillion.\nThe IIROC sets and monitors regulatory capital requirements for MATCHNow to protect its clients and counterparties. MATCHNow is required to maintain a prescribed minimum level of risk adjusted capital (“RAC”) of\n$\n0.2\nmillion in accordance with such requirements as IIROC may from time to time prescribe. As of December 31, 2020, MATCHNow had RAC of\n$\n2.2\nmillion, which was\n$\n2.0\nmillion in excess of its required RAC of\n$\n0.2\nmillion.\nAs a designated contract market regulated by the CFTC, CFE is required to meet\ntwo\ncapital adequacy tests: (i) its financial resources must be equal to at least twelve months of its projected operating costs and (ii) its unencumbered, liquid financial assets, which may include a line of credit, must be equal to at least six months of its projected operating costs. As of December 31, 2020, CFE had annual projected operating expenses of\n$\n52.1\nmillion and had financial resources that exceeded this amount. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, CFE had projected operating expenses for the upcoming six months of\n$\n26.1\nmillion and had unencumbered, liquid financial assets, including a line of credit from Cboe, that exceeded this amount.\n123\nAs a swap execution facility regulated by the CFTC, Cboe SEF is required to meet two capital adequacy tests: (i) its financial resources must be equal to at least twelve months of its projected operating costs and (ii) its unencumbered, liquid financial assets must be equal to at least six months of its projected operating costs. As of December 31, 2020, Cboe SEF had annual projected operating expenses of\n$\n0.8\nmillion and had financial resources that exceeded this amount. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, Cboe SEF had projected operating expenses for the upcoming six months of\n$\n0.4\nmillion and had unencumbered, liquid financial assets that exceeded this amount.\n20.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nStock-based compensation is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, which is recognized over the related service period, net of actual forfeitures. The service period is the period over which the related service is performed, which is generally the same as the vesting period. Vesting may be accelerated for certain officers and employees as a result of attaining certain age and service-based requirements in the Company’s long-term incentive plan and award agreements.\nThe Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of\n$\n21.7\nmillion,\n$\n21.8\nmillion, and\n$\n35.1\nmillion, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively. Stock-based compensation expense is included in compensation and benefits and acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe activity in the Company's stock options and restricted stock, consisting of restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), was as follows:\nStock Options\nSummary stock option activity is presented below:\n​\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was\n$\n0.9\nmillion and\n$\n26.0\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRSAs and RSUs\nThe following table summarizes RSA and RSU activity during the year ended December 31, 2020:\n​\nRSAs granted to non-employee members of the board of directors have a\none-year\nvesting period and vesting accelerates upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company. Unvested portions of the RSAs will be forfeited if the director leaves the Company prior to the applicable vesting date. The RSAs have voting rights and entitle the holder to receive dividends.\n124\nRSUs entitle the holder to\none\nshare of common stock upon vesting, typically vest over a\nthree\nyear\nperiod, and vesting accelerates upon the occurrence of a change in control or a termination of employment following a change in control or in the event of a participant’s earlier death or disability. Vesting will also accelerate upon a qualified retirement. Qualified retirement eligibility occurs once achieving\n55\nyears of age and\n10\nyears of service for grants awarded in and after 2017. Unvested RSUs will be forfeited if the officer, or employee leaves the Company prior to the applicable vesting date, except in limited circumstances. The RSUs have no voting rights but entitle the holder to receive dividend equivalents.\nIn connection with the Merger, each award of restricted Bats common stock (“Bats restricted shares”) granted under any of the Bats Plans that was unvested immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger was assumed by the Company and converted into an award of restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule) that applied to the applicable Bats restricted shares immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (but taking into account any changes, including any acceleration of vesting of such Bats restricted shares, occurring by reason provided for in the agreement related to the Merger).\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, to satisfy employees’ tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock, the Company purchased\n100,466\nshares of common stock totaling\n$\n11.8\nmillion as the result of the vesting of\n272,258\nshares of restricted stock.\nPSUs\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock unit contingent upon achievement of performance conditions, or PSU, activity during the year ended December 31, 2020:\n​\nPSUs include awards related to earnings per share during the performance period as well as awards related to total shareholder return during the performance period. The Company used the Monte Carlo valuation model method to estimate the fair value of the total shareholder return PSUs which incorporated the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate\n(\n1.36\n)%\n,\nthree\n-year\nvolatility\n(\n21.0\n)%\nand\nthree\n-year\ncorrelation with S&P 500 Index\n(\n0.25\n)\n. Each of these performance shares has a performance condition under which the number of units ultimately awarded will vary from\n0\n%\nto\n200\n%\nof the original grant, with each unit representing the contingent right to receive\none\nshare of the Company’s common stock. The vesting period for the PSUs contingent on the achievement of performance conditions is\nthree\nyears\n. For each of the performance awards, the PSUs will be settled in shares of the Company’s common stock following vesting of the PSU assuming that the participant has been continuously employed during the vesting period, subject to acceleration in the event of a change in control of the Company, or a termination of employment following a change in control, or in the event of a participant’s earlier death or disability. Participants have no voting rights with respect to the PSUs until the issuance of the shares of common stock. Dividends are accrued by the Company and will be paid once the PSUs contingent on the achievement of performance conditions vest.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, to satisfy employees’ tax obligations upon the vesting of performance stock, the Company purchased\n19,456\nshares of common stock totaling\n$\n2.4\nmillion as the result of the vesting of\n48,053\nshares of performance stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were\n$\n21.8\nmillion in total unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance stock units. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.7\nyears.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn May 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (“ESPP”), under which a total of\n750,000\nshares of the Company’s common stock will be made available for purchase to employees. The ESPP is\n125\na broad-based plan that permits the Company’s employees to contribute up to\n10\n%\nof wages and base salary to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount, subject to applicable annual Internal Revenue Service limitations. Under the ESPP, a participant may not purchase more than a maximum of\n312\nshares of the Company’s common stock during any single offering period. No participant may accrue options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a rate that exceeds\n$\n25,000\nin fair market value of the Company’s common stock (determined at the time such options are granted) for each calendar year in which such rights are outstanding at any time. The exercise price per share of common stock shall be\n90\n%\n(for eligible U.S. employees) or\n85\n%\n(for eligible international employees) of the lesser of the fair market value of the stock on the first day of the applicable offering period or the applicable exercise date.\nThe Company records compensation expense over the offering period related to the discount that is given to employees, which totaled\n$\n0.3\nmillion and\n$\n0.4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020,\n692,432\nshares were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP\n.\n21.  EQUITY\nCommon Stock\n​\nThe Company’s common stock is listed on Cboe BZX under the trading symbol CBOE. As of December 31, 2020,\n325,000,000\nshares of the Company’s common stock were authorized,\n$\n0.01\npar value,\n125,998,967\nand\n107,299,933\nshares were issued and outstanding, respectively. The holders of common stock are entitled to\none\nvote per share.\nCommon Stock in Treasury, at Cost\n​\nThe Company accounts for the purchase of treasury stock under the cost method with the shares of stock repurchased reflected as a reduction to Cboe stockholders’ equity and included in common stock in treasury, at cost in the consolidated balance sheets. Shares repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase program are available to be redistributed. When treasury shares are redistributed, they are recorded at the average cost of the treasury shares acquired. The Company held\n18,699,034\nof common stock in treasury as of December 31, 2020 and\n15,044,997\nshares as of December 31, 2019.\nShare Repurchase Program\n​\nIn 2011, the board of directors approved an initial authorization for the Company to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock of\n$\n100\nmillion and approved additional authorizations of\n$\n100\nmillion in each of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016,\n$\n150\nmillion in February 2018,\n$\n100\nmillion in August 2018, and\n$\n250\nmillion in October 2019, and\n$\n250\nmillion in June 2020, for a total authorization of\n$\n1.4\nbillion. The Company expects to fund repurchases primarily through the use of existing cash balances. The program permits the Company to purchase shares, through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws. It does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at any specific time or situation.\nUnder the program, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased\n3,534,115\nshares of common stock at an average cost per share of\n$\n98.78\n, totaling\n$\n349.1\nmillion. Since inception of the program through December 31, 2020, the Company has repurchased\n17,250,124\nshares of common stock at an average cost per share of\n$\n66.66\n, totaling\n$\n1.1\nbillion.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had\n$\n200.1\nmillion of availability remaining under its existing share repurchase authorizations.\n​\n126\nThe table below shows the repurchased shares of common stock under the Company’s share repurchase program during the periods presented as follows:\n​\n​\nPurchase of Common Stock from Employees\n​\nThe Company purchased\n120,552\nand\n143,247\nshares that were not part of the publicly announced share repurchase authorization from employees for an average price paid per share of\n$\n117.98\nand\n$\n97.22\nduring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These shares consisted of shares retained to cover payroll withholding taxes or option costs in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share awards, and stock option exercises.\n​\nPreferred Stock\n​\nThe Company has authorized the issuance of\n20,000,000\nshares of preferred stock, par value\n$\n0.01\nper share, issuable from time to time in one or more series. For the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, the Company had\nno\nshares of preferred stock issued or\noutstanding\n.\n​\nDividends\n​\nDuring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020\n, the Company declared and paid cash dividends per share of\n$\n1.56\n,\nfor an aggregate payout of\n$\n170.6\nmillion. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019\n, the Company declared and paid cash dividends per share of\n$\n1.34\n,\nfor an aggregate payout of\n$\n150.0\nmillion.\nEach share of common stock, including RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs, is entitled to receive dividend and dividend equivalents, respectively, if, as and when declared by the board of directors of the Company. The Company’s expectation is to continue to pay dividends. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of the Company’s board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness and other considerations the board of directors deems relevant. Future debt obligations and statutory provisions, among other things, may limit, or in some cases prohibit, the Company’s ability to pay dividends.\nAs a holding company, the Company’s ability to declare and continue to pay dividends in the future with respect to its common stock will also be dependent upon the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to it under applicable corporate law\n.\n127\n22.  INCOME TAXES\nNet deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n​\nThe Company provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on management’s assessment of historical and projected future operating results and other available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance of\n$\n6.8\nmillion was recorded against gross deferred tax assets for certain investments, net operating and capital losses as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has capital loss carryforwards of\n$\n8.0\nmillion, which, if unused, will expire in 2024.\nThe Company considers its non-U.S. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. to the extent these earnings are not subject to U.S. income tax under an anti-deferral tax regime. As of December 31, 2020, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings in these subsidiaries is\n$\n32.1\nmillion. Given our intent to reinvest these earnings for an indefinite period of time, we have not accrued a deferred tax liability on these earnings. A determination of an unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consists of the following (in millions):\n​\n128\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, income before taxes consists of the following (in millions):\n​\nA reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 is as follows:\n​\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending uncertain tax positions, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in thousands):\n​\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company had\n$\n137.4\nmillion,\n$\n114.9\nmillion, and\n$\n99.5\nmillion, respectively, of uncertain tax positions, net of federal benefit, which, if recognized in the future, would affect the effective income tax rate. Reductions to uncertain tax positions from the lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations and potential audit settlements during the next twelve months are estimated to be approximately\n$\n0.2\nmillion.\nEstimated interest costs and penalties are classified as part of the provision for income taxes in the Company's consolidated statements of income and were\n$\n6.9\nmillion,\n$\n6.6\nmillion, and\n$\n1.1\nmillion, for the periods ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties were\n$\n26.1\nmillion,\n$\n19.2\nmillion and\n$\n12.6\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the tax years that are either currently under audit or remain open and subject to examination by the tax authorities in the most significant jurisdictions in which Cboe operates:\n​\n​\nThe Company petitioned the Tax Court on January 13, 2017, May 7, 2018 and November 29, 2018 for a redetermination of IRS notices of deficiency for Cboe and certain of its subsidiaries for tax years 2011 through 2015 related to its Section 199 claims. The Company also filed a complaint on October 5, 2018 with the Court of Federal Claims for a refund of Section 199 claims related to tax years 2008 through 2010. The U.S. Tax Court set the trial to start in May 2021. The Company believes the aggregate amount of any additional liabilities that may result from these examinations, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not resolved these matters, and proceedings continue in Tax Court and the Court of Federal Claims.\n129\n23.  EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe computation of basic net income per common share is calculated by reducing net income for the period by dividends paid or declared and undistributed net income for the period that are allocated to participating securities to arrive at net income allocated to common stockholders. Net income allocated to common stockholders is divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period to determine net income per share allocated to common stockholders.\nThe computation of diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income allocated to common stockholders by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus all additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect is calculated using the more dilutive of the two-class or treasury stock method.\nAdditionally, the change in the redemption value for the noncontrolling interest reduces net income allocated to common stockholders.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except per share data):\n​\nFor the periods presented, the Company did not have shares of stock-based compensation that would have an anti-dilutive effect on the computation of diluted earnings per share\n.\n24.  COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, AND GUARANTEES\nLegal Proceedings\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below, as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company reviews its legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure\n130\ndecisions. The Company establishes accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and the Company discloses the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for the consolidated financial statements to not be misleading. The Company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. The Company’s assessment of whether a loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews, inspections or other legal proceedings, if any, has been incurred. While the consequences of certain unresolved proceedings are not presently determinable, the outcome of any proceeding is inherently uncertain and an adverse outcome from certain matters could have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company in any given reporting period.\nCity of Providence\nOn April 18, 2014, the City of Providence, Rhode Island filed a securities class action lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Bats and Direct Edge Holdings LLC, as well as\n14\nother securities exchanges. The action purports to be brought on behalf of all public investors who purchased and/or sold shares of stock in the United States since April 18, 2009 on a registered public stock exchange (“Exchange Defendants”) or a U.S.-based alternate trading venue and were injured as a result of the alleged misconduct detailed in the complaint, which includes allegations that the Exchange Defendants committed fraud through a variety of business practices associated with, among other things, what is commonly referred to as high frequency trading. On May 2, 2014 and May 20, 2014, American European Insurance Company and Harel Insurance Co., Ltd. each filed substantially similar class action lawsuits against the Exchange Defendants which were ultimately consolidated with the City of Providence, Rhode Island securities class action lawsuit. On June 18, 2015, the Southern District of New York (the “Lower Court”) held oral argument on the pending Motion to Dismiss and thereafter, on August 26, 2015, the Lower Court issued an Opinion and Order granting Exchange Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, dismissing the complaint in full. Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal of the dismissal on September 24, 2015 and its appeal brief on January 7, 2016. Respondent's brief was filed on April 7, 2016 and oral argument was held on August 24, 2016. Following oral argument, the Court of Appeals issued an order requesting that the SEC submit an amicus brief on whether the Lower Court had jurisdiction and whether the Exchange Defendants have immunity in the claims alleged. The SEC filed its amicus brief with the Court of Appeals on November 28, 2016 and Plaintiff and the Exchange Defendants filed their respective supplemental response briefs on December 12, 2016. On December 19, 2017, the Court of Appeals reversed the Lower Court’s dismissal and remanded the case back to the Lower Court. On March 13, 2018, the Court of Appeals denied the Exchange Defendants’ motion for re-hearing. The Exchange Defendants filed their opening brief for their motion to dismiss May 18, 2018, Plaintiffs’ response was filed June 15, 2018 and the Exchange Defendants’ reply was filed June 29, 2018. On May 28, 2019, the Lower Court issued an opinion and order denying the Exchange Defendants’ motion to dismiss. On June 17, 2019, the Exchange Defendants filed a motion seeking interlocutory appeal of the May 28, 2019 dismissal order, which was denied July 16, 2019. Exchange Defendants filed their answers on July 25, 2019. The discovery period in the matter commenced and is scheduled to continue through at least the first half of 2021. Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate what, if any, liability may result from this litigation. However, the Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to litigate the matter vigorously.\nVIX Litigation\nOn March 20, 2018, a putative class action complaint captioned Tomasulo v. Cboe Exchange, Inc., et al., No. 18-cv-02025 was filed in federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the Company intentionally designed its products, operated its platforms, and formulated the method for calculating VIX and the Special Opening Quotation, (i.e., the special VIX value designed by the Company and calculated on the settlement date of VIX derivatives prior to the opening of trading), in a manner that could be collusively manipulated by a group of entities named as John Doe defendants. A number of similar putative class actions, some of which do not name the Company as a party, were filed in federal court in Illinois and New York on behalf of investors in certain volatility-related products. On June 14, 2018, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation centralized the putative class actions in the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois. On September 28, 2018, plaintiffs filed a master, consolidated complaint that is a putative class action alleging various claims against the Company and John Doe defendants in the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois. The claims asserted against the Company consist of a Securities Exchange Act fraud claim,\nthree\nCommodity Exchange Act claims and a state law negligence claim. Plaintiffs request a judgment awarding class damages in an unspecified amount, as well as punitive or exemplary damages in an unspecified amount, prejudgment interest, costs\n131\nincluding attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses and such other relief as the court may deem just and proper. On November 19, 2018, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the master consolidated complaint and the plaintiffs filed their response on January 7, 2019. The Company filed its reply on January 28, 2019. On May 29, 2019, the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois granted the Company’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ entire complaint against the Company. The state law negligence claim was dismissed with prejudice and the other claims were dismissed without prejudice with leave to file an amended complaint, which plaintiffs filed on July 19, 2019. On August 28, 2019, the Company filed its second motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint and plaintiffs filed their response on October 8, 2019. On January 27, 2020, the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois granted the Company’s second motion to dismiss and all counts against the Company were dismissed with prejudice. On April 21, 2020, the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois granted plaintiffs’ motion to certify the January 27, 2020 dismissal order for an immediate appeal. On May 19, 2020, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (“7th Circuit”), seeking to appeal the April 21, 2020 order granting the entry of partial final judgment and both orders granting the Company’s motions to dismiss entered on May 29, 2019 and January 27, 2020. On June 29, 2020, plaintiffs filed their opening brief with the 7th Circuit, on August 28, 2020 the Company filed its opposition brief with the 7th Circuit, on September 7, 2020, CME Group Inc., Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. and National Futures Association filed an amici curiae brief in support of the Company on the Bad Faith Standard with the 7th Circuit and on October 16, 2020, plaintiffs filed their reply brief with the 7th Circuit. Oral arguments were held remotely on November 30, 2020 and the parties are currently awaiting a decision by the 7\nth\nCircuit. The Company currently believes that the claims are without merit and intends to litigate the matter vigorously. The Company is unable to estimate what, if any, liability may result from this litigation.\nSIFMA\nSecurities Industry Financial Markets Association (“SIFMA”) has filed a number of denial of access applications with the SEC to set aside proposed rule changes to establish or modify fees for Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX and EDGA (the “Exchanges”) market data products and related services (the “Challenged Fees”). The Challenged Fees were held in abeyance pending a decision, which was issued by the SEC on October 16, 2018, on a separate SIFMA denial of access application regarding fees proposed by Nasdaq and the NYSE for their respective market data products. NASDAQ and NYSE filed petitions for review (“PFRs”) with the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) seeking to appeal the SEC’s opinion (“Bellwether Case”). On June 5, 2020, the D.C. Circuit granted the PFRs and vacated the SEC’s finding that SIFMA could challenge generally applicable market data fees as a denial of access under Section 19(d) of the Exchange Act. In a second order entered on October 16, 2018, the SEC issued an order (the “Order”) that remanded the stayed Challenged Fees and ordered the Exchanges to: (i) within six months of the Order, provide notice to the SEC of developed or identified fair procedures for assessing the Challenged Fees (the “Procedures”) and (ii) within one year of the Order, apply the Procedures to the Challenged Fees and submit to the SEC a record explaining the Exchanges’ conclusions. On October 26, 2018, the Exchanges filed a motion to reconsider the Order with the SEC. On November 21, 2018, the Exchanges filed with the SEC a joinder motion to NYSE’s prior motion for stay of the Order. On December 3, 2018, SIFMA filed a response to NYSE’s motion for stay. Nasdaq withdrew its motion to reconsider the Order with the SEC on December 4, 2018, and on December 5, 2018, filed a Petition for Review with the D.C. Circuit. On December 14, 2018, the SEC denied the motion for stay but tolled the compliance date set forth in the remand order until ruling is made on the motion to reconsider. The Exchanges and NYSE filed on January 4, 2019 a motion to intervene in the Nasdaq Petition for Review to ensure the ability to participate in the case; the motion to intervene was granted on January 25, 2019. On the same day, SIFMA filed a motion with the D.C. Circuit moving to dismiss or hold in abeyance the Petition for Review. The Exchanges and NYSE submitted on February 6, 2019 a statement of issues for consideration in connection with the Petition for Review pending before the D.C. Circuit. On March 29, 2019, the D.C. Circuit issued an order indicating that SIFMA’s motion to dismiss will be considered with the underlying merits of the Petition for Review. On May 7, 2019, the SEC denied the Exchanges and NYSE’s motion for reconsideration of the Order. The SEC also further tolled the effectiveness of the remand order subject to the resolution of the substantive SIFMA case against Nasdaq and NYSE Arca that is already before the D.C. Circuit. On June 17, 2019, the Exchanges filed a petition for review of the May 7, 2019 SEC order denying reconsideration of the Order with the D.C. Circuit and of the Order. The Exchanges’ joint opening brief was filed on October 23, 2019, the SEC’s response was filed on November 22, 2019, the Exchanges’ joint reply was filed on December 20, 2019 and final briefs were filed on January 10, 2020. Oral arguments were held on February 18, 2020. On June 5, 2020, the D.C. Circuit remanded the Order to the SEC for reconsideration in light of the Bellwether Case opinion, i.e., that generally applicable market data fees may not be challenged as a denial of access under Section 19(d) of the Exchange Act. On August 7, 2020, the SEC entered an Order Vacating Prior Order and Requesting Additional Briefs. By September 3, 2020, all applications that had been previously filed with the SEC for review were the subject of notices for voluntary dismissal. On September 9, 2020, the Exchanges filed a response to the SEC’s August 7, 2020 Order. On October 5, 2020, the SEC entered an Order Granting Requests to Withdraw Applications for Review and Dismissing Review Proceedings. The SEC did not file a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court as to the Bellwether Case by November 2, 2020. The matter is now concluded.\n132\nOther\nAs self-regulatory organizations under the jurisdiction of the SEC, Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX and EDGA are subject to routine reviews and inspections by the SEC. As a designated contract market under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, CFE is subject to routine rule enforcement reviews and examinations by the CFTC. Cboe SEF, LLC is a swap execution facility registered with the CFTC and subject to routine rule enforcement reviews and examinations by the CFTC. Cboe Trading and BIDS Trading are subject to reviews and inspections by FINRA. The Company has from time to time received inquiries and investigative requests from the SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations and the CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight as well as the SEC Division of Enforcement and CFTC Division of Enforcement seeking information about the Company’s compliance with its obligations as a self-regulatory organization under the federal securities laws and Commodity Exchange Act as well as members’ compliance with the federal securities laws and Commodity Exchange Act.\nIn addition, while Cboe Europe, Cboe Chi-X Europe, EuroCCP, Cboe NL, and MATCHNow have not been the subject of any material litigation or regulatory investigation in the past, there is always the possibility of such action in the future. As Cboe Europe and Cboe Chi-X Europe are domiciled in the UK, it is likely that any action would be taken in the UK courts in relation to litigation or by the FCA in relation to any regulatory enforcement action. As EuroCCP is domiciled in the Netherlands, it is likely that any action would be taken in the Dutch courts in relation to litigation or by the DNB or Dutch Authority for Financial Markets in relation to any regulatory enforcement action. For Cboe NL, also domiciled in the Netherlands, it is likely that any actions would be taken in the Dutch courts in relation to litigation or Dutch Authority for Financial Markets in relation to any regulatory enforcement action. As MATCHNow is domiciled in Canada, it is likely that any action would be taken in the Canadian courts in relation to litigation or by the IIROC or Ontario Securities Commission in relation to any regulatory enforcement action.\nThe Company is also currently a party to various other legal proceedings in addition to those already mentioned. Management does not believe that the likely outcome of any of these other reviews, inspections, investigations or other legal proceedings is expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nSee also Note 10 (“Other Assets, Net”) for information on promissory notes related to the CAT.\nSee also Note 22 (“Income Taxes”).\nContractual Obligations\nSee Note 15 (“Clearing Operations”) for information on EuroCCP’s clearinghouse exposure guarantee.\nSee Note 25 (“Leases”) for information on lease obligations.\n25.  LEASES\nThe Company currently leases office space, data centers, remote network operations centers, and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with third parties as of December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, an additional\n$\n68.9\nmillion of right of use assets and\n$\n96.3\nmillion of lease liabilities were added related to new operating leases and modified operating leases.\n​\nThe following table presents the supplemental balance sheet information related to leases for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n​\n133\nThe following table presents operating lease costs and other information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except as stated):\n​\nThe total rent expense related to lease obligations, reflected in technology support services and facilities costs line items on the consolidated statements of income, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were\n$\n20.2\nmillion,\n$\n12.4\nmillion, and\n$\n10.1\nmillion, respectively.\nThe maturities of the lease liabilities are as follows as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\n(1) Total lease payments include\n$\n20.4\nmillion related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised\n.\n​\n​\n134\n26.  QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)\n​\n​\n27.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn February 5, 2021, the Company announced that its board of directors authorized an additional\n$\n200\nmillion to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock. This is in addition to any unused amount remaining under prior authorizations.\nOn February 11, 2021, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of\n$\n0.42\nper share. The dividend is payable on March 15, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 26, 2021.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Company granted\n239,853\nRSUs and\n71,302\nPSUs to certain officers and employees at a fair value, based on the closing price of the Company’s stock on the grant date. The shares have a\nthree year\nvesting period based on achievement of certain service, performance and/or market conditions and vesting accelerates upon the occurrence of a termination of employment following a change in control of the Company or in the event of earlier death, disability or qualified retirement, though a portion of the awards vest immediately based upon the combination of age and years of service in accordance with the plan.\n​\n135"

Based upon that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\n(b)   Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control system has been designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. Management based its assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included evaluating the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The results of its assessment were reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors.\nManagement’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, excluded EuroCCP, acquired with effect from July 1, 2020; MATCHNow, acquired with effect from August 4, 2020; and BIDS Holdings, acquired with effect from December 31, 2020. These acquired businesses had aggregate total assets and total stockholders’ equity of $1.3 billion and $205.2 million, respectively, and total revenues and revenues less costs of revenues of $30.4 million and $24.2 million, respectively, which are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNo changes occurred in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during fourth quarter 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on its assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, management believes that, as of\nDecember 31, 2020, internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report on page 92."
