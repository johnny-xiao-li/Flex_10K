    "text": "RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and in any other documents to which we refer you in this Form 10-K, before purchasing our securities.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.\nRisks related to our business\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic\nOur overall performance depends upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions.  The global spread of COVID-19 has created volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption.  The pandemic has caused and may continue to cause a slowdown in worldwide economic activity, decreased demand for products and services, and disruptions to global supply chains and financial markets.  These effects have resulted and may result in additional lost or delayed revenue to us and have disrupted our business operations as we have transitioned to remote working environments, restricted employee travel, and significantly limited access to, and imposed social distancing requirements within, our facilities including research and development facilities.\nOur dealer network, suppliers, and contract manufacturers have been similarly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the event of continuing and significant disruptions, there is no guarantee that we would be able to find alternative sources of distribution, supply, or manufacturing, which could delay our ability to market, source, manufacture, and ship our products.  These distribution and supply chain effects may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and could result in an increase in our costs of production and distribution.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, operations, and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including:\n•\nthe duration and scope of the pandemic, the availability of and timing for distributing vaccines and the efficacy of vaccines, including with respect to new strains of the virus, and the continuing economic impacts of the pandemic;\n•\ngovernmental, business, and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic;\n•\nthe effect on our customers and customer demand for and ability to pay for our products and services;\n•\nrestrictions or disruptions to transportation, including reduced availability of ground or air transport;\n•\ndisruption of the supply chain for our products;\n•\nour ability to comply with financial covenants, including maintaining required leverage ratios, which could result in debt becoming due and payable prior to its stated maturity; and\n•\nchanges in our effective tax rate due to effects of COVID-19 on our geographic mix of earnings.\nIn addition, the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions may impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity and energy prices, and interest rates.  Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.  In regions that fail to fully contain COVID-19 or suffer a COVID-19 relapse, those markets may not recover as quickly or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions\nGlobal or regional conditions may harm our financial results.\nWe have operations in many countries, and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from countries outside of the United States.  As a result, our operations, and our financial results, including our ability to design, develop, or sell products, may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n•\nglobal and local economic conditions;\n•\nthe demand and cost of commodities, such as corn and oil;\n•\nthe strength of the agricultural, engineering, and construction markets;\n•\ninadequate infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;\n16\n•\ngovernment restrictions on our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;\n•\ndiffering employment practices and labor issues;\n•\nformal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and import or export licensing requirements, which could be changed without notice;\n•\nineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;\n•\nuncertain economic and political conditions in countries where we do business;\n•\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices;\n•\ndiffering regional responses and restrictions related to global pandemics, like the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n•\nuncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, including the impact of the United Kingdom’s recent withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”).\nThere is inherent risk that political, diplomatic, or military events could result in trade disruptions, including tariffs, trade embargoes, export restrictions, and other trade barriers.  A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the margin that we earn on sales, make our products more expensive for customers or create uncertainty around demand for certain types of products, which could make our products less competitive and reduce customer demand.  Given the change in U.S. presidential administration and the current political climate, there is uncertainty about the trade policies, treaties, government regulations, and tariffs that could apply to trade.  In addition, if there is continuing deterioration in the global economy, the economies of the countries or regions where our customers are located or do business, or the industries that we or our customers serve, the demand for our products and services would likely decrease.  In addition, government or customer efforts, attitudes, laws or policies may lead to non-U.S. customers favoring domestic suppliers that could compete with or replace our products, which would also have an adverse effect on our business.  Changes in economic conditions and political uncertainty surrounding international trade also make it difficult to make financial forecasts.  Any of these factors or any combination of these factors could cause us to miss our financial projections and adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEngaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks.\nRisks associated with engaging in international business include:\n•\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n•\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n•\ndiffering local customer product preferences and requirements than our U.S. markets; and\n•\ndifficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights.\nThese factors or any combination of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our increasingly diverse and complex businesses and operations, our ability to generate growth and revenue from new or existing customers may be adversely affected\nBecause our operations are geographically diverse and increasingly complex, our personnel resources and infrastructure could become strained, and our reputation in the market and our ability to successfully manage and grow our business may be adversely affected.  The size, complexity, and diverse nature of our business and the expansion of our product lines and customer base have placed increased demands on our management and operations, and future growth may place additional strains on our resources in the future.  Our ability to effectively compete and to manage our planned future growth will depend on, among other things, the following:\n•\nmaintaining continuity in our senior management and key personnel;\n•\nincreasing the productivity of our existing employees;\n•\nattracting, retaining, training, and motivating our employees, particularly our technical and management personnel;\n•\ndeploying our solutions using third-party information systems, which may require changes to our applications, documentation, and operational processes;\n•\nimproving our operational, financial, and management controls; and\n•\nimproving our information reporting systems and procedures.\n17\nWe have increasingly diversified the nature of our businesses both organically and by acquisition.  As a result, an increasing amount of our business involves business models that require managerial techniques and skill sets that are different from those required to manage our historical core businesses.\nOver the last few years, we have focused more on subscription models.  As a result, we expect to derive an increasing portion of our revenue in the future from subscriptions.  The subscription models provide our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period.  Market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to security, reliability, performance, current license terms, customer preference and industry adoption, social/community engagement, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data, public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations.  We may be  unable to successfully support and host our subscription offerings in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties.\nThese factors or a combination of these factors could\nhave an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in our software and subscription businesses may adversely impact our operations and financial results\nAn increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue, which includes SaaS and new subscription services for integrated solutions.  Our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period, which typically ranges from one to three years.  Our customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including overall economic conditions, the health of their businesses, competitive offerings, and customer dissatisfaction with our services.  If customers do not renew their contracts for our products, our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline, and our financial results will suffer.  Any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell, even if our customer acquisition rates do not change, will have an adverse impact on our future maintenance revenue growth.  If any of our assumptions about expenses, revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect, or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely impacted.\nWe continually re-evaluate our software licensing programs and subscription programs, including specific license models, delivery methods, and terms and conditions.  Changes to our licensing programs and subscription programs, including the introduction of new subscription services for integrated solutions that include hardware, the timing of the release of enhancements, upgrades, maintenance releases, the term of the contract, discounts, promotions, and other factors could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products, and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  We may implement different licensing models that require us to recognize licensing fees over a longer period.  Over the last few years, we have increasingly offered additional products through a SaaS model.  SaaS revenue is currently recognized ratably over the subscription period.  Any significant increase in the percentage of our business generated from a subscription model could increase the amount of revenue to be recognized over time as opposed to upfront, which would delay revenue recognition and have an adverse impact on our operating results in a quarterly period.  Due to these complexities, we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue, which could cause us to miss our earnings estimates or revenue projections and adversely impact our stock price.\nWe may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships\nWe believe that in certain business opportunities, our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants, such as Caterpillar, Nikon, Hilti, and CNH Global.  Our failure to form and maintain such alliances, or the preemption or disruption of such alliances by actions of competitors, could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers.  Our relationships with substantial industry participants such as Caterpillar and CNH Global are complex and multifaceted and are likely to evolve over time based upon the changing business needs and objectives of the parties.  Evolution of our respective business strategies and diversification of product portfolios may lead to increased competition with our strategic allies, placing additional pressure on these relationships.  Since these strategic relationships contribute to significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets, changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales.  In addition, we utilize dealer networks, including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as Caterpillar and CNH Global to market, sell, and service many of our products.\nChanges in our product mix, including increasing provision of subscription services for integrated solutions tailored to the needs of specific vertical markets, impose new demands on our distribution channels and may require significant changes in the skills and expertise required to successfully distribute our products and services, or the creation of new distribution channels.  Recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use and the selling of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources.  In order to develop and expand our distribution channels, we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channels, including our investment in systems\n18\nand training, and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage.  The time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings, including our new product developments, and newer types of offering, such as subscription programs for integrated solutions that include hardware, software maintenance, and other recurring services, may make it more difficult to introduce those products to end-users and delay end-user adoption, which could result in lower revenue.\nDisruption of dealer coverage within specific geographic or end-user markets could cause difficulties in marketing, selling, or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Moreover, dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability.  Such sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInvesting in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly, place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, or may fail to deliver the expected return on investment, which could adversely impact our results of operations\nWe typically acquire a number of businesses each year and intend to continue to acquire other businesses.  Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including:\n•\npotential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration;\n•\nloss of key employees or customers of acquired operations;\n•\ndifficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and personnel of the acquired companies;\n•\npotential disruption of our business or the acquired business;\n•\nunanticipated expenses related to acquisitions;\n•\nunanticipated difficulties in conforming business practices, policies, procedures, internal controls, and financial records of acquisitions with our own business;\n•\nimpairment of relationships with employees, customers, vendors, distributors or business partners of either an acquired company or our own business;\n•\ninability to accurately forecast the performance of recently acquired businesses, resulting in unforeseen adverse effects on our operating results;\n•\npotential liabilities, including liabilities resulting from known or unknown compliance or legal issues, associated with an acquired business; and\n•\nadverse accounting impact to our results of operations because of purchase accounting treatment and the business or accounting practices of acquired companies.\nAny such effects from acquisitions could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources.\nAs a result of acquisitions, we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles.  The testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions.  Changes in business conditions or in the prospects or results of operations of the acquired business could require negative adjustments to the valuation of these assets resulting in write-offs that would adversely affect our results.  If we divest a business and the proceeds are less than the net book value at the time, we would have to write off the difference.  In addition, changes in the operating results or the valuation of companies in which we have investments may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to write down the value of such investment.\nEven if successfully negotiated and closed, acquisitions may not yield expected synergies, may not advance our business strategy as expected, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets, or may not prove successful or effective for our business.  Companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures, which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face substantial competition in our markets, which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our financial condition and results of operations\nOur markets are highly competitive, and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future.  Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price, quality and performance of our products, the effectiveness of our distribution channel and direct sales force, the level of customer service, the development of new technology, and our ability to participate in emerging markets.  Within each of our markets, we encounter direct competition from other GNSS, software, optical, and laser suppliers, and competition may intensify from various larger U.S. and non-U.S. competitors and new market entrants, particularly from markets such as China.  Our products, which commonly use GNSS for basic location information, may be subject to competition from alternative location technologies such as simultaneous location and mapping technology.  In our software and subscription services businesses, we face competition from a group of large, well-established companies, particularly in the areas of design, enterprise resource planning (ERP), collaboration and project management solutions.  Our integrated hardware and software products may be subject to increasing competition from mass\n19\nmarket devices such as smartphones and tablets used in conjunction with relatively inexpensive applications, which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past.  These developments may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to, including those related to cloud computing, mobile devices, and new computing platforms.  Such competition has in the past resulted, and in the future may result, in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition.  We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products.  We may not be able to implement this strategy successfully, and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and other resources than we do.\nRisks related to our technology and products\nOur products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors, product defects, security vulnerabilities, or software errors\nOur products, including our software products, are highly technical and complex and, when deployed, may contain errors, defects, or security vulnerabilities.  We must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market, and we have a history of frequently introducing new products.  Products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released.  Such occurrences could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources, increased customer service and support costs, warranty claims, and litigation.\nWe warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time, depending on the product.  In addition, certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses.  If invoked, these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory, or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective.\nErrors, viruses, or bugs may be present in software or hardware that we acquire or license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our products.  Our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions.  Changes to third party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable.  Any errors, defects, or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in, or compatibility issues with, any third-party hardware or software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers, theft of trade secrets, data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third party hardware or software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, and other malicious software programs that could attack our products.  Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or use competitive products.\nOur internal and customer-facing systems, and systems of third parties we rely upon, may be subject to cybersecurity breaches, disruptions, or delays\nA cybersecurity incident in our own systems or the systems of our third-party providers may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our own internal data, the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers, or our customer data.  Computer hackers, foreign governments, or cyber terrorists may attempt to or succeed in penetrating our network security and our website.  The recent discovery of wide-scale cybersecurity intrusions into U.S. government and private company computer networks by alleged Russian state actors underscores the ongoing threat posed by sophisticated and foreign state-sponsored attacks.  Unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through break-ins, sabotage, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, employee theft or misuse, breach of the security of the networks of our third-party providers, or other misconduct.  Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data.\n20\nWe have experienced security breaches in the past, and despite our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems, it is impossible to eliminate this risk.  Because the techniques used by computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently, they may take advantage of weaknesses in third-party technology or standards of which we are unaware or that we do not control and may not be recognized until long after they have been launched against a target.  We may be unable to anticipate or counter these techniques.  It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data or confidential information may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers, vendors, or business partners.  Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement, and maintain.  Such efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and may limit the functionality of, or otherwise adversely impact our service offering and systems.  A cybersecurity incident affecting our systems may also result in theft of our intellectual property, proprietary data, or trade secrets, which would compromise our competitive position, reputation, and operating results.  We also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived personal data breach (including the EU Lead Data Protection Authority) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods.\nThe systems we rely upon also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of other factors, including access to the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites, earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, human error, and similar events or disruptions.  Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities.  Our systems are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays, and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services.\nWe rely on our information systems and those of third parties for activities such as processing customer orders, delivery of products, hosting and providing services and support to our customers, billing and tracking our customers, hosting and managing our customer data, and otherwise running our business.  Any disruptions or unexpected incompatibilities in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business.\nAn increasing portion of our revenue comes from SaaS solutions and other hosted services in which we store, retrieve, communicate, and manage data that is critical to our customers’ business systems.  Disruption of our systems that support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems.  Any such disruptions could harm our reputation, create liabilities to our customers, hurt demand for our services and solutions, and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on new products and services, and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market or to effectively compete with new, disruptive product alternatives, our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated\nOur future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis.  We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services, enhance existing products, and achieve market acceptance of such products and services.  We may encounter problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services.  Our development stage products may not be successfully completed or, if developed, may not achieve significant customer acceptance.  Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and we might not achieve our goals as to the timing of introducing new technology products or could encounter increased costs.  The timely availability and cost-effective production of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.  If we are unable to introduce new products and services, if other companies develop competing technology products and services, or if we do not develop compelling new products and services, our number of customers may not grow as anticipated, or may decline, which could harm our operating results.  Many of our offerings are increasingly focused on software and subscription services.  The software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences, which require us to address multiple delivery platforms, new mobile devices, and cloud computing.  Life cycles of software products can be short, and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products.  The introduction of third-party solutions embodying new, disruptive technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete or non-competitive.  If we are not able to develop software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, or if we are unable to adapt to new platforms, technologies, or new industry standards that impact our markets, our ability to retain or increase market share and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n21\nSome of our products rely on third party technologies including open source software, which could result in product incompatibilities or harm availability of our products and services\nWe license software, technologies, and intellectual property underlying some of our software from third parties.  The third-party licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported, maintained, or enhanced by the licensors, resulting in development delays.  Some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors.  In some cases, if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements, the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately.  The loss of licenses to, or inability to support, maintain, and enhance, any such third-party software or technology could result in increased costs, or delays in software releases or updates, until such issues have been resolved.  This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also incorporate open source software into our products.  Although we monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products.  In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to disclose and offer royalty-free licenses in connection with our own source code, to re-engineer our products, or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on proprietary technology, which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources\nOur future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology, and we rely on patent, trade secret, trademark, and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property.  The patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or challenged.  The rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us.  Any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.  Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology, or design around the patents owned by us.  In addition, effective copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited, or not applied for in certain countries.  The steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology.\nThe value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings.  Third parties may claim that we or our customers (some of whom are indemnified by us) are infringing their intellectual property rights.  For example, individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers.  The number of these claims has increased in recent years.  As new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents, it may be necessary for us to secure a license from such patent holders, redesign our products, or withdraw products from the market.  In addition, the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations.  Any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources, including the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n22\nWe are dependent on limited source manufacturers and suppliers for certain of our products and critical components; a disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations\nWe are dependent upon a limited number of contract manufacturers for the manufacture, testing, and assembly of certain products and specific suppliers for a number of our critical components.  Our current reliance on a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required products or components to meet customers’ delivery requirements, a risk that we may accumulate excess inventories if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules, discontinuation of or increased prices for certain components, and economic conditions that may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers.  Any disruption in our supply chain could reduce our revenue and adversely impact our financial results.  Such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events, including, but not limited to, increases in wages that drive up prices or labor stoppages, the imposition of regulations, quotas or embargoes on components, a scarcity of, or significant increase in the price of, required electronic components for our products, trade restrictions, tariffs or duties, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, transportation failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods, third party interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain, the unavailability of raw materials, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, civil unrest, military conflicts, geopolitical developments, war or terrorism, and disruptions in utility and other services.  Any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture, assemble, and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products, which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum; our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses\nOur GNSS technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands.  International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations.  These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.  Each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.\nAny ITU or local reallocation of radio frequency bands, including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant adverse impacts on our customers, both of which could reduce demand for our products.\nFor example, in 2020 the FCC approved a proposal by a private party to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the authorized GNSS bands for terrestrial wireless operations throughout the United States.  The company has opposed and continues to oppose this proposal, along with a wide range of participants in commercial and governmental sectors that rely on the use of GNSS in their critical activities.  The FCC’s action is subject to further review as well as potential legislative action.  If the FCC’s action continues in effect and terrestrial operations are implemented in the affected spectrum, these operations could create harmful interference to GNSS receivers in proximity to such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers.  Similarly, other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our products as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our products.\nMany of our products use other radio frequency bands, such as the public land mobile radio bands, together with the GNSS signal, to provide enhanced GNSS capabilities, such as real-time kinematics precision.  The continuing availability of these non-GNSS radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced GNSS products to our precision survey, agriculture, and construction machine controls markets.  In addition, transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or in-band may impair the utility and reliability of our products.  Any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n23\nMany of our products rely on GNSS technology, GPS and other satellite systems, which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue\nGNSS technology, GPS satellites, and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption.  Many of the GPS satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.  However, of the current deployment of operational satellites in orbit, some have been in operation for 15 years or more.  Repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible.  If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites.  A reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24-satellite standard established for GPS may impair the utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities.  In addition, software updates to GPS satellites and ground control segments, and infrequent known events such as GPS week number rollover, may adversely affect our products and customers.  We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of system updates to mitigate these problems, which may not be available or complete.\nWe are dependent on continued operation of GPS, the principal GNSS currently in operation.  The GPS constellation is operated by the U. S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS.  If supporting policies were to change, or if user fees were imposed, it could have an  adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and  results of operations.\nMany of our products also use signals from systems that augment GPS, such as the Wide Area Augmentation System and National Differential GPS System, and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our RTX corrections services.  Some of these augmentation systems are operated by the U.S. government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems.  Any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to, or use of the signals, or discontinuance of service could result in degradation of our services or product performance, with an adverse effect on our business.\nMany of our products use satellite signals from the Russian GLONASS and the European Galileo GNSS Systems.  Other\ncountries, including China and India, are in the process of creating their own GNSS systems, and we either have developed or will develop products that use GNSS signals from these systems.  National or European authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets, including our competitors, which could harm our competitive position.\nUse of non-U.S. GNSS signals are also subject to FCC waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations.  If we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems, or obtain timely and equal access to service signals, this could result in lost revenue.  These authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use of their GNSS systems, to the detriment of our products using the U.S. GPS system, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRegulatory risks\nWe face risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations\nThese laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export control laws, and laws that prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws that have recently been the subject of a substantial increase in global enforcement.  Many of our products are subject to U.S. export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or that require an export license in connection with sales outside the United States.  Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise.  Also, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions or conditions on the conduct of our business.  Any such violations could include prohibitions or conditions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results.\nWe operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.  We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses, or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties.\n24\nWe are subject to evolving privacy laws in the United States and other jurisdictions that are subject to potentially differing interpretations and which could adversely impact our business and require that we incur substantial costs\nExisting privacy-related laws and regulations in the United States and other countries are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various U.S. federal and state or other international legislative and regulatory bodies may expand or enact laws regarding privacy and data security-related matters.  For example, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, a basis for data transfers from the EU to the U.S., was invalidated by the European Court of Justice, and we expect that the international transfer of personal data will present ongoing compliance challenges and complicate our business transactions and operations.  Brexit, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes with regard to personal data transfers between the two territories.  New privacy laws have come into effect in Brazil and New Zealand in 2020, and revisions of privacy laws are currently pending in countries like Canada and China.  Some countries are considering or have passed legislation that requires local storage and processing of data, including geospatial data.  In addition, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which took effect in January 2020 and has been\namended by\nthe California Privacy Rights Act (“the “CPRA”) passed via ballot initiative in November 2020 and will fully take effect in January 2023.  The CCPA and CPRA, among other things, gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used.  Other states and the U.S. Congress have introduced data privacy legislation that may impact our business.  Data privacy legislation, amendments and revisions to existing data privacy legislation, and other developments impacting data privacy and data protection may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, increase the complexity of providing our products and services, and cause us to incur substantial costs in an effort to comply.  Failure to comply may lead to significant fines and business interruption.\nWe are subject to the impact of governmental and other certifications processes and regulations, which could adversely affect our products and our business\nWe market many products that are subject to governmental regulations and certifications before they can be sold.  The European Union increasingly regulates the use of our products on agriculture, construction, and other types of machinery.  As we develop and enhance features which support automated and autonomous operation of our products, we are increasingly subject to functional safety regulation.  CE certification is required for GNSS receivers and data communications products, which must also conform to the European harmonized GNSS receiver requirements and the radio equipment directive to be sold in the European community.  In the future, U.S., European, or other governmental authorities may propose GPS receiver testing and certification for compliance with published GPS signal interface or other specifications.  Governmental authorities may also propose other forms of GPS receiver performance standards, which may limit design alternatives, hamper product innovation, or impose additional costs.  Some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end-user to obtain licensing from the FCC and other national authorities for frequency-band usage.  Compliance with evolving product regulations in our major markets could require that we redesign our products, cease selling products in certain markets, and increase our costs of product development.  An inability to obtain required certifications in a timely manner could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market and harm our customer relationships.  Failure to comply with evolving requirements could result in fines and limitations on sales of our products.\nFinancial and tax risks\nOur debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, our total debt was comprised primarily of senior notes of $1,300.0 million, and four uncommitted revolving credit facilities totaling $255.8 million.  When our senior notes mature, we will have to expend significant resources to repay these senior notes or seek to refinance them.  If we decide to refinance the senior notes, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the senior notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition.  Any downgrade by credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets, or result in more restrictive covenants in future debt agreements.\nOur outstanding indebtedness could have other important consequences, such as:\n•\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes, and other cash requirements, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward;\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•\nreducing our ability to make investments and acquisitions which support the growth of the company, or to repurchase shares of our common stock; and\n25\n•\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in, our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThere are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments.  If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity, and we may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due.  A default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.  A portion of our outstanding debt has interest rates which float based on prevailing interest rates and we may incur additional variable-rate debt in the future.  Such rates tend to fluctuate based on general economic conditions, general interest rates, Federal Reserve rates, and the supply of and demand for credit in the relevant interbanking market.\nIf interest rates increase, our interest expense will also increase as would the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt.\nOur ability to incur additional indebtedness over time may be limited due to applicable financial covenants and restrictions, and due to the risk that significantly increasing our level of indebtedness could impact the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations, which in turn would increase the interest rates and fees that we pay in connection with our indebtedness.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods\nAs a global company, we are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.  While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.  Our effective tax rate is largely based on the geographic mix of earnings, statutory rates, inter-company transfer pricing, and enacted tax laws.  A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including:\n•\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n•\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with U.S. and foreign tax authorities;\n•\nchanges in our intercompany transfer pricing methodology;\n•\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n•\nincreases in expense not deductible for tax purposes, including transaction costs and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n•\nchanges in the realizability of available tax credits;\n•\nchanges in share-based compensation;\n•\nchanges in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, including the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) and the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) project conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”); and\n•\nchanges in generally accepted accounting principles.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied, and governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies.  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act, which made substantial changes to U.S. tax law.  The ongoing implementation and interpretation of the Tax Act, any additional forthcoming legislative or administrative guidance and accounting standards related to the Tax Act could adversely affect our future effective tax rates.  The implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with, and benefit from, the Tax Act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  In light of recent changes in U.S. tax laws and to align with our international business operations, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed a non-U.S. intercompany transfer of our intellectual property to a subsidiary in the Netherlands.   This transfer and other changes we make to practices and processes based upon changes in U.S. and other tax laws are subject to challenge, and an adverse outcome in any such challenge could adversely affect our reported financial results.\nAdditionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of the BEPS reporting requirements recommended by the G8, G20, and the OECD.  The foreign countries where we do business may change tax laws, regulations, and interpretations on a prospective or retroactive basis and these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates.  As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted.  Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their\n26\npotential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by state and foreign taxing authorities.  If taxing authorities of any jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position, we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings could be adversely affected.\nWe may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates\nWe are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates.  Although the majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies.  An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses, procurement of raw materials from sources outside the United States, and overseas capital expenditures.  We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies.  Our foreign exchange forward contracts reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to ownership of our stock\nThe volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.  During fiscal 2020, our stock price ranged from $21.32 to $66.77.\nWe believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:\n•\ngeneral conditions in the worldwide economy;\n•\nquarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;\nannouncements and reports of developments related to our business, our major customers and partners, and the industries in which we compete, or the industries in which our customers compete;\n•\nsecurity breaches;\n•\nacquisition announcements;\n•\nnew products or product enhancements announced or introduced by us or our competitors;\n•\ndisputes with respect to developments in patents or other intellectual property rights;\n•\ndevelopments in our relationships with our partners, customers, and suppliers;\n•\nthe imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers;\n•\npolitical, economic, or social uncertainty;\n•\nglobal pandemics, like the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n•\nacts of terrorism.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “high-tech” companies in particular have frequently experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.  Any such fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate, which could adversely impact our operations, financial results, and stock price\nOur operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.  Results in any period could be affected by:\n•\nchanges in market demand;\n•\ncompetitive market conditions;\n•\nthe timing of recognizing revenue;\n•\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nthe cost and availability of components;\n•\nthe mix of our customer base and sales channels;\n•\nthe mix of products sold;\n•\npricing of products;\n•\nchanges in U.S. or foreign policies on taxes, trade, or spending, including the Tax Act;\n•\nregional responses and restrictions related to global pandemics, like the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n•\nother risks, including those described below.\n27\nSeasonal variations in demand for our products may also affect our quarterly results.  Construction equipment revenue has historically been the highest in early spring.  Our agricultural equipment revenue has historically been the highest in the first quarter, followed by the second quarter, reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the Northern hemisphere.  If we do not accurately forecast seasonal demand, we may be left with unsold inventory or have a shortage of inventory, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nDue in part to the buying patterns of our customers, a portion of our hardware revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter, while our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable.  These patterns could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred, orders are not received, or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter.\nThe price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event any of these risks result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which are based on historical and predictive models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future.\nGeneral risk factors\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes\nWe are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits.  Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.  Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict.  Management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period.  A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which, if not expected, could harm our financial condition, and results of operations.\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could disrupt our operations\nActs of war, acts of terrorism or civil unrest, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, especially any events that impact our larger markets or GNSS signals or systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military activity in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism or hostilities, may involve a redeployment of the satellites used in GNSS or interruptions of the system.  Civil unrest, local conflicts, or other political instability may adversely impact regional economies, cause work stoppages, or result in limitations on business transactions with the affected jurisdictions.  To the extent that such interruptions result in delays or the cancellation of orders, disruption of the manufacturing or shipment of our products, or reduced demand for our products, these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFuture public health crises and epidemics could impact our international operations and sales\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that future pandemics, similar to COVID-19 or any other epidemic, harm any significant market where we do business.  Contagious disease epidemics or global pandemics could also significantly impact our international supply chain and result in component and product shortages and general disruptions to the economy.  Such outbreaks could also result in mass quarantines, business closures, and significantly impact our suppliers, customers, and commercial partners in affected areas, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations."

Our comprehensive work process solutions are used across a range of industries including architecture, building construction, civil engineering, geospatial, survey and mapping, agriculture, natural resources, utilities, transportation, and government.  Our representative customers include construction owners, contractors, engineering and construction firms, surveying companies, farmers and agricultural companies, energy and utility companies, trucking companies, and state, federal, and municipal governments.  Further information on our business is presented in Part I,\nOur growth strategy is centered on multiple elements:\n•\nExecuting on our Connect and Scale 2025 strategy;\n•\nFocus on attractive markets with significant growth and profitability potential;\n•\nDomain knowledge and technological innovation that benefit a diverse customer base;\n•\nIncreasing focus on software and services;\n•\nGeographic expansion with localization strategy;\n•\nOptimized go-to-market strategies to best access our markets; and\n•\nStrategic acquisitions\nOur focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability and an increasingly diversified business model.  We continue to experience a shift in revenue towards a more significant mix of software, recurring revenue, and services, which represented 58% of total revenue for fiscal 2020, and is leading to improved visibility in our businesses.  Additionally, our success in driving annualized recurring revenue (“ARR”)\n(1)\ngrowth of 9% year-over-year for fiscal 2020 has positively impacted our revenue mix and growth over time.  As our solutions have expanded, our go-to-market model has also evolved with a balanced mix between direct, distribution, and OEM customers as well as an increasing number of enterprise level customer relationships.\n(1)\nSee Supplemental Disclosure of Annualized Recurring Revenue and Non-GAAP Financial Measures for definition.\nCOVID-19 UPDATE\nIn early March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.  As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded globally, we implemented protocols to safeguard our employees, customers, suppliers, third-party business partners and communities, and ensure business continuity.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors outside of our control, such as its continued and future overall impact on the global economy and in the industries where we operate.  We experienced an overall revenue decline in fiscal 2020, due to economic disruptions related to COVID-19 that began in the last weeks of March, primarily in hardware and professional services for the first two quarters.  Overall revenue increased in the third and fourth quarters.\nDespite the revenue shortfall, operating income increased due to improved mix of higher margin sales and reduced spending due to cost containment measures as well as natural reductions in spending resulting from COVID-19 restrictions.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic is continually evolving, we are uncertain of its ultimate duration, and the nature and extent of its impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  To the extent that regions where we do business or source our products experience additional closures or restrictions on business activity, our results of operations could be harmed.\nSee “1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\n32\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs of sales, operating expenses, and related disclosures.  We consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies.  These critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.  Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.  Revenue is recognized net of allowance for returns and any taxes collected from customers.  We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations; however, determining whether products or services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may sometimes require significant judgment.\nJudgment is required to determine stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation.  We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when products and services are sold separately and determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.  In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a U.S. based multinational company operating in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  Judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.  We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes.  Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment.  Changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized.\nWe are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the IRS, state, local, and foreign tax authorities who may challenge our tax positions.  We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree based on their fair values at the acquisition date.  The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill.\nWhen determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.  Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates.  Identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights, patents, licenses, technology, acquired backlog, trademarks, and in-process research and development.\nWe evaluate goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist.  We utilize either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative test to assess the likelihood of an impairment.  In performing the qualitative assessment, we consider macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors that may impact the reporting units.  When we perform a quantitative test, the estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of certain estimates and assumptions including expected future operating performance using risk-adjusted discount rates.\n33\nWe amortize identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.  Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to business models, or changes in the capital strategy could result in a revised useful life.  If the useful life of an asset is revised, the net book value of the estimated residual value is amortized over its revised remaining useful life.  Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows.  The estimated future cash flows are primarily based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe following table shows revenue by category, gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of revenue, operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue, and diluted earnings per share for the periods indicated:\n(1)\nS\nee Supplemental Disclosure of Annualized Recurring Revenue and Non-GAAP Financial Measures for definitions.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe have a 52-53 week fiscal year, ending on the Friday nearest to December 31, which for fiscal 2020 was January 1, 2021.  Fiscal 2020 and 2018 were both 52-week years.  Fiscal 2019 was a 53-week year.\n34\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019\nRevenue\nIn fiscal 2020, total revenue decreased by $116.6 million or 4%.  Overall revenue decreased due to weakness in Transportation, and to a lesser extent, Buildings and Infrastructure and Geospatial, which were impacted in the first two quarters by COVID-19.  The decrease was partially offset by organic and acquisitions growth in Resources and Utilities, as well as recovery in Buildings and Infrastructure and Geospatial in the third and fourth quarters.  We consider acquisition growth to include acquisition revenue that was not applicable in the prior corresponding periods.\nBy revenue category, overall product revenue decreased $106.8 million or 6%, service revenue decreased $41.4 million or 6%, and subscription revenue increased $31.6 million or 5%.  Product revenue decreased primarily due to weakness in our hardware sales in Transportation, and to a lesser extent, Buildings and Infrastructure, partially offset by growth in Resources and Utilities.  Geospatial was relatively flat.  The decrease in Geospatial hardware sales in the first two quarters was largely offset by increased hardware sales in the third and fourth quarters.  Service revenue decreased due to lower professional services associated with customer installations.  Subscription revenue increased primarily due to strong organic growth in Buildings and Infrastructure, and to a lesser extent, acquisition revenue from Resources and Utilities, partially offset by weakness in Transportation.\nDuring fiscal 2020, sales to customers in North America represented\n52%; Europe represented 29%; Asia Pacific represented 13%; and the rest of world represented 6% of our total revenue.\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2020 and 2019.  No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019.\nGross Margin\nGross margin varies due to several factors including product mix, pricing, distribution channel, production volumes, new product start-up costs, and foreign currency translations.\nIn fiscal 2020, gross margin decreased by $26.0 million or 1% primarily due to revenue declines as noted above, partially offset by improved product mix.  Gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 55.8% in fiscal 2020 compared to 54.6% in fiscal 2019.  This growth in gross margin percentage was driven by improved revenue mix, including increased higher margin software and subscription sales in Buildings and Infrastructure and Resources and Utilities, as well as new product introductions and less discounting in Geospatial, partially offset by product mix and pricing pressures in Transportation.\nOperating Income\nIn fiscal 2020, operating income increased by $43.9 million or 12%.  Operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2020 was 13.3% compared to 11.5% in fiscal 2019.  Despite the revenue shortfall, operating income and operating income as a percentage of total revenue increased due to strong results in Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities including improved mix of higher margin sales, as well as operating expense reductions across all segments, partially offset by weaker sales and gross margin compression in Transportation.\n35\nResearch and Development, Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table shows research and development (“R&D”), sales and marketing (“S&M”), and general and administrative (“G&A”) expense along with these expenses as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019\nIn fiscal 2020, overall, R&D, S&M, and G&A expenses decreased by $60.7 million or 5%.\nR&D expense increased by $6.2 million or 1%.  The increase in R&D expense was primarily due to higher compensation expense, including incentive compensation, and increased R&D expenses from acquired businesses not included in the prior corresponding period, partially offset by lower consulting and outside services and travel reductions.\nWe believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success, and we expect to continue active development of new products.\nS&M expense decreased by $37.2 million or 7%.  The decrease in S&M expenses was primarily due to travel reductions, lower advertising costs, and lower compensation expense, partially offset by\nhigher S&M expenses from acquired businesses not included in the prior corresponding p\neriod.\nG&A expense decreased by $29.7 million or 9%.  The decrease in G&A expense was primarily due to lower compensation expense, lower tax and legal costs, and travel reductions, partially offset by increased G&A expenses from acquired businesses not included in the prior corresponding period.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nThe following table shows amortization of purchased intangible assets for the periods indicated:\nIn fiscal 2020, total amortization of purchased intangibles decreased $10.0 million or 6% primarily due to the expiration of prior year acquisitions' amortization.\nNon-operating expense, net\nThe following table shows non-operating expense, net for the periods indicated:\n36\nIn fiscal 2020, total non-operating expense, net decreased by $6.3 million or 20% primarily due to lower interest costs and increased joint venture profitability, partially offset by unfavorable impacts fro\nm foreign currency exchange incl\nuded in Other income, net.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\"), enacted on March 27, 2020, provides tax relief to individuals and businesses in light of the impacts of COVID-19.  It did not result in material adjustments to our income tax provision or to our net deferred tax assets as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nIn December 2020, due to a change in the Netherlands tax law, the statutory tax rate was increased from 21.7% to 25.0%, effective January 1, 2021.  As a result, we recorded a one-time tax benefit of $64.0 million due to the revaluation of the Netherlands deferred tax assets.\nIn December 2019, to align with our international business operations, we completed a non-U.S. intercompany transfer of our intellectual property to a subsidiary in the Netherlands.  The transaction resulted in deferred tax assets in the Netherlands and global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) deferred tax liabilities in the U.S., recorded at the applicable statutory tax rates, resulting in a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $206.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nOur effective income tax rates for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 1.1% and -49.2%, respectively.\nThe effective income tax rates in fiscal 2020 increased compared to 2019 primarily due to the one-time tax benefit from the non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nResults by Segment\nWe report our financial performance, including revenue and operating income, based on four reportable segments:  Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, Resources and Utilities, and Transportation.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Decision Maker views and evaluates operations based on the results of our reportable operating segments under our management reporting system.  These results are not necessarily in conformance with U.S. GAAP.  For additional discussion of our segments, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n37\nThe following table shows a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated:\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to our consolidated income before income taxes for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019\nBuildings and Infrastructure\nBuildings and Infrastructure revenue decreased by $27.2 million or 2%, and segment operating income increased by $18.2 million or 6%.  Revenue decreased primarily due to a decline in civil engineering and construction hardware sales in the first two quarters of fiscal 2020 and lower revenue from professional services due to the economic impacts of COVID-19, partially offset by higher software maintenance and subscription revenue.  Hardware sales recovered in the third and fourth quarters due to improved market conditions including pent up demand and government stimulus programs.  Segment operating income and\n38\noperating income as a percentage of segment revenue increased due to gross margin improvements from higher mix of software maintenance and subscription revenue as well as cost reductions.\nGeospatial\nGeospatial revenue increased by $1.1 million or less than 1%, and segment operating income increased by $52.2 million or 39%.  Revenue was relatively flat for the year; while survey sales recovered in the third and fourth quarters due to improved market conditions, including pent up demand, government stimulus programs, and new product introductions, there was a decline in the first two quarters due to the economic impacts of COVID-19.  Segment operating income and operating income as a percentage of segment revenue increased primarily due to gross margin improvements resulting from new higher margin product introductions and less discounting as well as cost reductions.\nResources and Utilities\nResources and Utilities revenue increased by $58.6 million or 10%, and segment operating income increased by $51.9 million or 31%.  Revenue increased due to strength in agriculture reseller and OEM channels resulting from improved market conditions, including stabilization of commodity prices, government stimulus programs, and weather conditions.  Acquisition revenue, primarily Cityworks, also contributed to growth.  Segment operating income and operating income as a percentage of segment revenue increased due to revenue expansion and gross margin improvements resulting from higher margin software maintenance and subscription sales, as well as cost reductions.\nTransportation\nTransportation revenue decreased by $151.8 million or 19%, and segment operating income decreased by $75.8 million or 60%.  Revenue decreased primarily due to reduced hardware upgrades and subscriber declines, attributable in part to challenges with the electronic logging device transition in the trucking industry, as well as the economic impacts of COVID-19.  Conversion of customers from perpetual software to subscription products also reduced revenue.  Segment operating income and operating income as a percentage of segment revenue decreased primarily due to the revenue declines, discrete inventory charges, and higher operating expense due to the Kuebix acquisition, partially offset by cost reductions.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nOther than inventory purchases and other commitments incurred in the normal course of business (see Contractual Obligations table below), we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities.\nIn the normal course of business to facilitate sales of our products, we indemnify other parties, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with us, with respect to certain matters.  We may agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties.  These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.  In connection with divesting some of our businesses or assets, we may also indemnify purchasers for certain matters in the normal course of business, such as breaches of representations, covenants or excluded liabilities.  In addition, we entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.  Historically, payments made by us under these agreements were not material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019.\n39\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nOur ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability, the rate of collections of accounts receivable, our inventory turns, and our ability to manage other areas of working capital.  Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions.  Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.  Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions considered to be of reputable credit and to present little credit risk.  We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings, as described below under the heading “Debt”, along with cash provided by operations, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, debt service, stock repurchases under our 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, and planned capital expenditures.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $672.0 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $585.0 million for fiscal 2019.  The increase of $87.0 million was primarily driven by an increase in net income, net of non-cash items, and favorable working capital changes, including positive accounts receivable impact, due to improved sales linearity and higher accrued compensation, partially offset by deferred revenue and accrued liabilities changes.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $231.8 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $275.3 million for fiscal 2019.  The decrease of $43.5 million was primarily due to decreased spending for business acquisitions, and to a lessor extent, reduced spending on property and equipment.  The current year included Kuebix acquisition compared to the prior year, which included the Cityworks acquisition.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $400.3 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $292.6 million during fiscal 2019.  The increase of $107.7 million was primarily driven by the increase in debt repayments, net of proceeds, partially offset by a decrease in the repurchase of common stock.\nDebt\nDuring fiscal 2020, we repaid $312.2 million of debt, including the full repayment of our term loan, net of borrowings.  Each of our debt agreements requires us to maintain compliance with certain debt covenants, all of which we were in compliance with at the end of fiscal 2020.  Refer to Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt.\n40\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2020:\n(1)\nAmount represents principal payments over the life of our debt obligations. Refer to Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt.\n(2)\nAmount represents the expected interest payments relating to our debt, calculated using rates in effect at the end of fiscal 2020.  Refer to Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt.\n(3)\nOperating leases represent undiscounted lease payments and include short-term leases and leases that were signed, but have not yet commenced at the end of fiscal 2020.  Refer to Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our leases.\n(4)\nOther purchase obligations and commitments primarily represent open non-cancelable purchase orders for material purchases with our vendors and also include estimated payments due for acquisition related earn-outs.\n(5)\nIncome taxes payable represents a one-time transition tax liability related to known amounts of cash taxes payable in future years as a result of the Tax Act.\nExcluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits of $55.4 million included in Other non-current liabilities, including interest and penalties.  At this time, we cannot make a reasonably, reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability, and therefore, such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above.  Refer to Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our taxes.\nEFFECT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nThe impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in Note 1 of our accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nS\nUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF ANNUALIZED RECURRING REVENUE AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future.  Our non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures.  The non-GAAP financial measures and detailed explanations to the adjustments to comparable GAAP measures are below.\n41\n42\n43\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue Explanation\nIn addition to providing non-GAAP financial measures, we disclose ARR to provide investors with supplementary indicators of the value of our current recurring revenue contracts.\nARR represents the estimated annualized value of recurring revenue, including subscription, maintenance and software revenue,  and term license contracts for the quarter.  ARR is calculated by adding the portion of the contract value of all of our term licenses attributable to the current quarter to our non-GAAP recurring revenue for the current quarter and dividing that sum by the number of days in the quarter and then multiplying that quotient by 365.  ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue, as it is a performance measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items.\nNon-GAAP Explanations\nNon-GAAP revenue\nWe believe this measure helps investors understand the performance of our business, as non-GAAP revenue excludes the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting. Management believes that excluding fair value purchase accounting adjustments more closely correlates with the ordinary and ongoing course of the acquired company’s operations and facilitates analysis of revenue growth and trends.\nNon-GAAP gross margin\nWe believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-GAAP gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix, pricing decisions, and manufacturing costs influence our business.  Non-GAAP gross margin excludes the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue, amortization of purchased intangible assets, amortization of acquisition related inventory step-up, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, restructuring charges, and COVID-19 expenses.  We believe that these adjustments offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses\nWe believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our non-GAAP spending in relation to revenue.  Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude the effects of certain acquired capitalized commissions that were eliminated in purchase accounting, amortization of purchased intangible assets, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, and COVID-19 expenses.  We believe that these adjustments offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results and trends.\nNon-GAAP operating income\nWe believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-GAAP operating income trends, which are driven by revenue, gross margin, and spending.  Non-GAAP operating income excludes the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions, amortization of purchased intangible assets, amortization of acquisition related inventory step-up, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, and COVID-19 expenses.  We believe that these adjustments offer a supplemental means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to prior results and trends.\nNon-GAAP non-operating expense, net\nWe believe this measure helps investors evaluate our non-operating income trends.  Non-GAAP non-operating expense, net, excludes acquisition/divestiture items, deferred compensation, and debt issuance costs.  We believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results.\nNon-GAAP income tax provision\nWe believe this measure helps investors because it provides for consistent treatment of excluded items in our non-GAAP presentation and a difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates.  The non-GAAP tax rate excludes charges and benefits such as net deferred tax impacts results from the non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, tax law changes, net deferred tax impacts resulting from the U.S. 2017 Tax Act, and significant one-time reserve releases upon statute of limitations expirations.  We believe our non-GAAP tax rate facilitates a comparison of our period-to-period results, excluding the above items which can introduce volatility to our tax rate.\n44\nNon-GAAP net income\nThis measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends, which are driven by non-GAAP income before taxes and our non-GAAP tax rate.  Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions, amortization of purchased intangible assets, amortization of acquisition related inventory step-up, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, COVID-19 expenses, debt issuance costs, and non-GAAP tax adjustments.  We believe our investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to prior periods and trends.\nNon-GAAP diluted net income per share\nWe believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-GAAP operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring non-GAAP operating performance by ownership in the company.  Non-GAAP diluted net income per share excludes the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions, amortization of purchased intangible assets, amortization of acquisition related inventory step-up, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, COVID-19 expenses, debt issuance costs, and non-GAAP tax adjustments.  We believe that these adjustments offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to prior periods and trends.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we believe offers a useful view of the overall operations of our business. We believe it is useful because it facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by removing potential differences caused by variations unrelated to operating performance, such as capital structures (interest expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses.  We define Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP operating income plus depreciation expense and income from equity method investments, net.  Other companies define Adjusted EBITDA differently and so our measure may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures.  Our investors should consider the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA, including the fact that this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance.  Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternative to net income or operating income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.  In particular, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for our discretionary expenditures, as this measure does not consider certain cash requirements, such as restructuring charges, executive transition costs, acquisition and divestiture items, interest payments, tax payments and other debt service requirements.\nThese non-GAAP measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance, as well as our performance relative to competitors.  We believe some of our investors track our \"core operating performance\" as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of our operations.  Core operating performance excludes items that are non-cash, not expected to recur, or not reflective of ongoing financial results.  Management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period-to-period comparisons.  Accordingly, management excludes from non-GAAP the effects of purchase accounting adjustments to certain acquired deferred revenue and acquired capitalized commissions, amortization of purchased intangible assets, amortization of acquisition related inventory step-up, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, restructuring charges, executive transition costs, COVID-19 expenses, debt issuance costs, and non-GAAP tax adjustments.\n(A)\nAcquired deferred revenue adjustment\n.  Purchase accounting generally requires us to write-down acquired deferred revenue to fair value. Our GAAP revenue includes the fair value impact from purchase accounting for post-contract support and subscriptions contracts assumed in connection with our acquisitions.  The non-GAAP adjustment to our revenue is intended to reflect the full amount of such revenue.  We believe this adjustment is useful to investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of our business and facilitates analysis of revenue growth and business trends.\n(B)\nAmortization of acquired capitalized commissions\n.  Purchase accounting generally requires us to eliminate capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date.  Our GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect the amortization of these capitalized sales commissions balances. The non-GAAP adjustment to increase our sales and marketing expenses is intended to reflect the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented.  We believe this adjustment to sales and marketing expenses is useful to investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of our business.\n(C)\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n.  Included in our GAAP presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses is amortization of purchased intangible assets. We believe that by excluding the amortization of purchased intangible assets, which primarily represents technology and/or customer relationships already developed, this provides an\n45\nalternative way for investors to compare our operations pre-acquisition to those post-acquisition and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies.  However, we note that companies that grow internally will incur costs to develop intangible assets that will be expensed in the period incurred, which may make a direct comparison more difficult.\n(D)\nAmortization of acquisition-related inventory step-up.\nThe purchase accounting entries associated with our business acquisitions require us to record inventory at its fair value, which is sometimes greater than the previous book value of the inventory.  Included in our GAAP presentation, the increase in inventory value is amortized to cost of sales over the period that the related product is sold.  We exclude inventory step-up amortization from our non-GAAP measures because it is a non-cash expense that we do not believe is indicative of our ongoing operating results.\n(E)\nAcquisition / divestiture items\n.  Included in our GAAP presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses, acquisition costs consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal, due diligence, integration, and other closing costs including the acceleration of acquisition stock options and adjustments to the fair value of earn-out liabilities.  Included in our GAAP presentation of non-operating expense, net, acquisition/divestiture items includes\nunusual\nacquisition, investment, and/or divestiture gains/losses. Although we do numerous acquisitions, the costs that have been excluded from the non-GAAP measures are costs specific to particular acquisitions.  These are one-time costs that vary significantly in amount and timing and are not indicative of our core operating performance.\n(F)\nStock-based compensation / deferred compensation\n.  Included in our GAAP presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses are stock-based compensation consists of expenses for employee stock options and awards and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan.  Additionally included in our GAAP presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses are income or expense associated with movement in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities.  Changes in non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets, included in non-operating expense, net, offset the income or expense in the plan liabilities.  We exclude them from our non-GAAP measures because some investors may view it as not reflective of our core operating performance as they are a non-cash item.\n(G)\nRestructuring charges\n/ executive transition costs.\nIncluded in our GAAP presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses, restructuring charges recorded are primarily for employee compensation resulting from reductions in employee headcount in connection with our company restructurings, and lease and building costs.  Additionally, included in our GAAP presentation of operating expenses are amounts paid to former Company executives under the terms of the executive severance agreements.  We exclude restructuring charges and executive transition costs from our non-GAAP measures because we believe they do not reflect expected future operating expenses, they are not indicative of our core operating performance, and they are not meaningful in comparisons to our past operating performance.  We have incurred restructuring expenses in each of the periods presented. However, the amount incurred can vary significantly based on whether a restructuring has occurred in the period and the timing of headcount reductions. Further, we believe that excluding executive transition costs from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors because it allows for period-over-period comparability.\n(H)\nCOVID-19 expenses.\nIncluded in our GAAP presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses, COVID-19 expenses consist of costs incurred as a direct impact from the COVID-19 virus pandemic, such as cancellation fees of trade shows due to public safety issues, additional costs for disinfecting facilities, and personal protective equipment.  We exclude COVID-19 expenses from our non-GAAP measures because we believe they are one-time costs that vary significantly in amount and timing and are not indicative of our core operating performance.\n(I)\nDebt issuance costs.\nIncluded in our non-operating expense, net this amount represents incurred costs in connection with a bridge facility we put in place for the Viewpoint acquisition, costs associated with the issuance of new credit facilities and our senior notes issued in 2018 that were not capitalized as debt issuance costs, and a write-off of debt issuance costs for terminated and/or modified credit facilities.  We excluded the debt issuance cost write-off from our non-GAAP measures.  We believe that investors benefit from excluding this item from our non-operating income to facilitate an evaluation of our non-operating income trends.\n(J)\nNon-GAAP items tax effected\n.  This amount adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of the non-GAAP items (A) - (I) on non-GAAP net income.  This amount excludes the GAAP tax rate impact resulting from the tax reform impacts and non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, which is separately disclosed in items (L) and (M). We believe this information is useful to investors because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in this non-GAAP presentation.\n46\n(K)\nDifference in GAAP and Non-GAAP tax rate\n.  This amount represents the difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates applied to the non-GAAP operating income plus the non-GAAP non-operating expense, net.  The GAAP tax rate used for this calculation excludes the net deferred tax impacts resulting from the tax reform impacts and non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, which is separately disclosed in items (L) and (M).  T\nhe non-GAAP tax rate excludes charges and benefits such as net deferred tax impacts results from the non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, net deferred tax impacts resulting from the U.S. 2017 Tax Act, and significant one-time reserve releases upon statute of limitations expirations.\nWe believe that investors benefit from excluding this amount from our non-GAAP income tax provision because it facilitates a comparison of the non-GAAP tax provision in the current and prior periods.\n(L)\nTax reform impacts.\nThe provision primarily includes a one-time tax benefit from the policy election to establish deferred taxes in relation to GILTI as created by the Tax Act.  We excluded this item as it is a non-recurring expense.  We believe that investors benefit from excluding this item from our non-GAAP income tax provision because it allows for period-over-period comparability.\n(M)\nIP restructuring and tax law change impacts.\nThese amounts represent net deferred tax impacts resulting from a non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, consistent with tax law changes, including tax rates changes, and our international business operations.  We excluded this because it is not indicative of our core operating performance.\n(N)\nGAAP and non-GAAP tax rate percentages\n.  These percentages are defined as GAAP income tax provision as a percentage of GAAP income before taxes and non-GAAP income tax provision as a percentage of non-GAAP income before taxes.  We believe that investors benefit from a presentation of non-GAAP tax rate percentage as a way of facilitating a comparison to non-GAAP tax rates in prior periods.\n47"

    "text": "We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.  We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  All financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors.\nMarket Interest Rate Risk\nOur cash equivalents consisted primarily of interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits.  The main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return, without significantly increasing risk.\nDue to the nature of our cash equivalents that they are readily convertible to cash, we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates.\nWe are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities.  Our 2018 Credit Facility includes a five-year revolving loan facility with a maturity date of May 2023.  We also have four unsecured, uncommitted revolving credit facilities that are callable by the bank at any time.  We may borrow funds under the 2018 Credit Facility in U.S. Dollars, Euros or in certain other agreed currencies as described in Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, we had one £55.0 million, two $75.0 million, and one €100.0 million revolving credit facilities, which are uncommitted.  A hypothetical 1% increase in our borrowing rates at the end of fiscal 2020 could result in approximately\n$2.6 million\nannual increase in interest expense on these existing principal balances.\nThe hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future. Furthermore, the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time.  As a result, actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe operate in international markets, which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro.  In addition, volatile market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could result in changes in exchange rates.\nHistorically, the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in U.S. Dollars, with the most significant exception being Europe, where we invoice primarily in Euro.  Additionally, a portion of our expenses, primarily the cost to manufacture, cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services, sales and sales support, and research and development, are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro.\nRevenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can affect our operating income.  As exchange rates vary, operating income may differ from expectations. In fiscal 2020, revenue and operating income were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by  $3.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively.\n48\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash, debt, and certain trade and inter-company receivables and payables, primarily denominated in New Zealand Dollars, Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollars, Norwegian Krone, and Euro.  These contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements, as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts.  These instruments are marked-to-market through earnings every period and generally range from one to two months in maturity.  We do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes.  We occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions.  Foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows:\n49\nTRIMBLE INC.\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n50"

    "text": "51\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n52\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nSee accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n53\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n54\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nSee accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n55\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n56\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1:\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nTrimble Inc., (“we” or “our” or “us”) is incorporated in the State of Delaware since October 2016.\nWe are a leading provider of technology solutions that enable professionals and field mobile workers to improve or transform their work processes.  We focus on transforming the way the world works by delivering products and services that connect the physical and digital worlds. We generate revenue primarily through the sale of our hardware, software, maintenance and support, professional services, and subscriptions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Estimates and assumptions are used for revenue recognition, including determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and determining standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, provision for credit losses, sales returns reserve, inventory valuation, warranty costs, investments, acquired intangibles, goodwill and intangibles impairments, other long-lived asset impairments, stock-based compensation, and income taxes.  We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable and i\nnputs into our estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19.  Actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe use a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday nearest to December 31.  Fiscal 2020 and 2018 were both 52-week years ending on January 1, 2021 and December 28, 2018, respectively.  Fiscal 2019 was a 53-week year ended on January 3, 2020.  Unless otherwise stated, all dates refer to our fiscal year and fiscal periods.\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include our results of our consolidated subsidiaries.  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  Noncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling stockholders’ proportionate share of the net assets and results of operations of our consolidated subsidiaries.\nWe present revenue and cost of sales separately for products, services, and subscriptions.  Product revenue includes hardware and software licenses; service revenue includes maintenance and support for hardware and software products and professional services; subscription revenue includes software as a service (“SaaS”), data, and hosting services.\nReportable Segments\nWe report our financial performance, including revenue and operating income, based on\nfour\nreportable segments: Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, Resources and Utilities, and Transportation.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Decision Maker views and evaluates operations based on the results of our reportable operating segments under our management reporting system.  These results are not necessarily in conformance with U.S. GAAP.\nRevenue Recognition\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.  Revenue is recognized net of allowance for returns and any taxes collected from customers.  We enter into contracts that may include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations; however, determining whether products or services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may sometimes require significant judgment.\nJudgment is required to determine SSP for each distinct performance obligation.  We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when products and services are sold separately, and determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.  In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\n57\nNature of Goods and Services\nWe generate revenue primarily from products, services, and subscriptions; each of which is a distinct performance obligation.  Descriptions are as follows:\nProduct\nHardwar\ne is recognized when the control of the product transfers to the customer, which is generally when the product is shipped.  We recognize shipping fees reimbursed by customers as revenue and the cost for shipping as an expense in Cost of sales when control over products has transferred to the customer.\nSoftware\nincluding perpetual and term licenses is recognized upon delivery and commencement of license term.  In general, our contracts do not provide for customer specific acceptances.\nServices\nHardware maintenance and support, commonly called extended warranty,\nentitles the customer to receive replacement parts and repair services.  Extended warranty is separately priced and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the extended service period, which begins after the standard warranty period, ranging from\none\nto\ntwo years\ndepending on the product line.\nSoftware maintenance and support\nentitles the customer to receive software product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis and technical support.  Software maintenance is recognized on a straight-line basis commencing upon product delivery over the post-contract support term, which ranges from\none\nto\nthree years\n, with one year being most common.\nProfessional services\ninclude installation, training, configuration, project management, system integrations, customization, data migration/conversion, and other implementation services.  The majority of professional services are not complex, can be provided by other vendors, and are readily available and billed on a time-and-material basis. Revenue for distinct professional services is recognized over time, based on work performed.\nIn some contracts, products and professional services may be combined into a single performance obligation.  This generally arises when products or subscriptions are sold with significant customization, modification, or integration services.  Revenue for the combined performance\nis recognized over time as the work progresses because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer.\nSubscription\nSaaS may be sold with devices used to collect, generate, and transmit data.  SaaS is distinct from the related devices.  In addition, we may host the software that the customer has separately licensed.  Hosting services are distinct from the underlying software.\nSubscription terms generally range from month-to-month to\nthree years\n.  Subscription revenue is recognized monthly over the subscription term, commencing from activation.\nDeferred Costs to Obtain Customer Contracts\nOur incremental cost of obtaining contracts, which consists of sales commissions related to customer contracts that include maintenance or subscription revenue, are deferred if the contractual term is greater than a year or if renewals are expected, and the renewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission.  These commission costs are deferred and amortized over the benefit period, which is either the contract term or the shorter of customer or product life that ranges from\nthree\nto\nseven years\n.  We have elected the practical expedient to exclude contracts with an amortization period of a year or less from this deferral requirement.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represent contracted revenue for which goods or services have not been delivered.  The contracted revenue, which will be recognized in future periods, includes both invoiced amounts in deferred revenue as well as amounts that are not yet invoiced.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in local currencies are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, with the resulting translation adjustments, net of tax, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss within the Stockholders’ Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Income and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the year.\n58\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables,\nprimarily denominated in New Zealand Dollars, Brazil Real, Canadian Dollars, Norwegian Krone, and Euro.  T\nhese contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements, as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts.  These instruments are marked-to-market through earnings every\nreporting period and generally range from\none\nto\ntwo months\nin original maturity.  We occasionally enter into foreign currency forward co\nntracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions.  We do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes.  As of the fiscal years ended 2020 and 2019, there were\nno\nderivative financial instruments outstanding that were accounted for as hedges.\nConcentrations of Risk\nCash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions.  Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.  Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk.\nWe are also exposed to credit risk in our trade receivables, which are derived from sales to end-user customers in diversified industries as well as various resellers.  We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial conditions and limit the amount of credit extended, when deemed necessary, but generally do not require collateral.\nIn addition, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for a number of our critical components.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable, net, includes billed and unbilled amounts due from customers.  Unbilled receivables include revenue recognized that exceeds the amount billed to the customer, provided the billing is not contingent upon future performance, and we have the unconditional right to future payment with only the passage of time required.  Both billed and unbilled amounts due are stated at their net estimated realizable value.  The unbilled receivables were $\n138.7\nmillion and $\n129.5\nmillion at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n59\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that will not be collected.  Each reporting period, we evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality, historical experience, and current\nand future\neconomic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay.\nChanges in our allowance for credit losses at the end of fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Adjustments are also made to reduce the cost of inventory for estimated excess or obsolete balances.  Factors influencing these adjustments include declines in demand that impact inventory purchasing forecasts, technological changes, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration, and quality issues.  If our estimate used to reserve for excess and obsolete inventory differs from what is expected, we may be required to recognize additional reserves, which would negatively impact our gross margin.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the lease terms when applicable.  Useful lives generally range from\nfour\nto\nsix years\nfor machinery and equipment,\nfive\nto\nten years\nfor furniture and fixtures,\ntwo\nto\nfive years\nfor computer equipment and software,\nthirty-nine years\nfor buildings, and the life of the lease for leasehold improvements.  We capitalize eligible costs to acquire or develop certain internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage.  Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range generally from\ntwo\nto\nfive years\n.  The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.\nDepreciation expense was $\n39.7\nmillion\n,\n$\n39.4\nmillion and $\n35.6\nmillion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.  Operating leases with lease terms greater than one year are included in Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, in both Other current liabilities, and Operating lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.  Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.  Present value is determined by using our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowings over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date.  The operating lease ROU asset includes adjustments made for uneven rents, lease incentives, and lease impairments.  Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLease agreements that include both lease and non-lease components are accounted for as part of the overall lease arrangement.\n60\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree based on their fair values at the acquisition date, with any excess purchase price recognized as goodwill.\nWhen determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.  Critical estimates when valuing intangible assets include expected future cash flows based on consideration of future growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates.  Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions we believe a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.  Amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.  Intangible assets acquired individually, with a group of other assets, or in a business combination are recorded at fair value.  Identifiable intangible assets are comprised of technology, patents, licenses, customer contracts, acquired backlog, trademarks, and in-process research and\ndevelopment.  Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and have estimated useful lives ranging from\nthree years\nto\nten years\nwith a weighted average useful life of approximately\nseven years\n.  We write off fully amortized intangible assets when those assets are no longer used.  Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is subject to, at a minimum, an annual assessment for impairment.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist.  We utilize either a qualitative or quantitative approach to assess the likelihood of impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter.  When performing the qualitative assessment, we consider macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors that may impact the reporting units.  When performing the quantitative assessment, we compare the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the reporting unit's fair value.  When we perform a quantitative test, the estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of certain estimates and assumptions including expected future operating performance using risk-adjusted discount rates.  Actual future results may differ from those estimates.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.\nIdentifiable intangible assets and long-lived assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.  Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to business models, or changes in the capital strategy could result in a revised useful life.  If the useful life of an asset is revised, the net book value of the estimated residual value is amortized over its revised remaining useful life.  Intangible assets and long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment according to their asset groups whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets  may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows.  The estimated future cash flows are primarily based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance.  Assets held for disposal are measured at fair value less selling costs, and assets that are no longer in use are written off entirely at their cease-use dates.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock compensation expense is based on the\nmeasurement\ndate fair value of the awards, net of expected forfeitures.  Expense is generally recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over\nthe requisite service period of the stock awards.  The estimate of the forfeiture rate is based on historical experience.\nWarranty\nWe accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material product costs, technical support labor costs, and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf.  Our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment.  When products sold include warranty provisions, they are covered by a warranty for periods ranging from\none year\nto\ntwo years\n.\nAccrued warranty expenses o\nf $\n13.8\nmillion\nand $\n16.3\nmillion are included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n61\nGuarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others\nIn the normal course of business to facilitate sales of our products, we indemnify other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters.  We may agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties.  These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.  In connection with divesting some of our businesses or assets, we may also indemnify purchasers for certain matters in the normal course of business, such as breaches of representations, covenants, or excluded liabilities.  In addition, we entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.  Historically, payments made under these agreements were not material, and\nno\nliabilities have been recorded for these obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019.\nAdvertising and Promotional Costs\nWe expense all advertising and promotional costs as incurred.\nAdvertising and promotional expense was approximately\n$\n28.6\nmillion, $\n42.7\nmillion, and $\n42.7\nmillion, in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.  Costs of software developed for external sale subsequent to reaching technical feasibility were not significant and were expensed as incurred.  We received third-party funding of approximately\n$\n16.3\nmillion\n, $\n16.5\nmillion, and $\n19.5\nmillion in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  We offset research and development expense with any unconditional third-party funding earned and retain the rights to any technology developed under such arrangements.\nComputation of Earnings Per Share\nThe number of shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share represents the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period and excludes any potentially dilutive securities.  The dilutive effects of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and shares to be purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) are included in diluted earnings per share unless they are anti-dilutive.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized.  Our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to foreign net operating losses and state research and development credit carryforwards.\nRelative to uncertain tax positions, we only recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes.  Changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.  Our practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous other countries and are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions.  We generally believe that positions taken on our tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, but tax authorities in some circumstance have, and may in the future, successfully challenge these positions.  Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges.  The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income, and cash flows.\n62\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFiscal 2020 Adoption\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard that requires credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented based on the net amount expected to be collected.  Application of this standard replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects all expected credit losses.  Additionally, credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded through an allowance for credit losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost.\nWe adopted the new standard at the beginning of fiscal 2020 by applying a modified retrospective method without restating comparative periods.  The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring impairment charges to be based on the first step in the current two-step impairment test.  The impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\nWe adopted the new standard on a prospective basis at the beginning of fiscal 2020.  The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIntangibles - Internal-Use Software\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance that clarifies the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract.  This guidance aligns the accounting for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.\nWe adopted the guidance on a prospective basis for all implementation costs incurred after the beginning of fiscal 2020.  The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture Adoption\nIncome Taxes - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting for Income Taxes to reduce complexity by removing certain exceptions and implementing targeted simplifications.  The new standard is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2021.  Early adoption is permitted.  We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n63\nNOTE 2:\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing Net income attributable to Trimble Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing Net income attributable to Trimble Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been issued.  Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, RSUs, contingently issuable shares, and shares to be purchased under our ESPP.\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nFor fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018,\n0.5\nmillion,\n0.1\nmillion, and\n0.7\nmillion, respectively, of shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nNOTE 3:\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nDuring fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, we acquired multiple businesses, all with cash consideration.  The Consolidated Statements of Income include the operating results of the businesses from the dates of acquisition.\nDuring fiscal 2020, we acquired\nthree\nbusinesses, with total purchase consideration of\n$\n205.1\nmillion\n.  The acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate.  The largest acquisition was Kuebix,\na transportation\nmanagement system provider.  In the aggregate, the businesses acquired contributed less than\n1\n% of our total revenue during fiscal 2020.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we acquired\nfour\nbusinesses, with total purchase consideration of $\n247.0\nmillion.  The acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate.  The largest acquisition was Cityworks, a company that provides enterprise asset management (EAM) software for utilities and local government.  In the aggregate, the businesses acquired contributed less than\n1\n% of our total revenue during fiscal 2019.\nDuring fiscal 2018, we acquired\nsix\nbusinesses, with total purchase consideration of $\n1.8\nbillion, including e-Builder and Viewpoint, having cash transactions valued at $\n485.5\nmillion and $\n1,212.1\nmillion, respectively.  In the aggregate, the businesses acquired contributed approximately\n5\n% of our total revenue during fiscal 2018.\nWe determined the total consideration paid for each of our acquisitions as well as the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of each acquisition.  The excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.  The fair value of intangible assets acquired is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis.  For the acquisitions in fiscal 2020, the preliminary fair values of net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired were based on preliminary valuations and estimates, and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).\nAcquisition costs of\n$\n21.4\nmillion\n,\n$\n20.5\nmillion, and $\n38.9\nmillion in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, were expensed as incurred and are included in Cost of sales and General and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n64\nThe following table summarizes the business combinations completed during the periods indicated:\nIntangible Assets\nThe following table presents details of total intangible assets.  As of the end of fiscal 2020, $\n338.3\nmillion of fully amortized intangible assets were written off.  Amounts reported at the end of fiscal 2019 have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.\nThe estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets at the end of fiscal 2020 is as follows (in millions):\nGoodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment were as follows:\n65\nNOTE 4:\nCERTAIN BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS\nThe components of inventory, net were as follows:\nFinished goods includes $\n11.7\nmillion\nand $\n5.6\nmillion at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, for costs of sales that have been deferred in connection with deferred revenue arrangements.\nThe components of property and equipment, net were as follows:\nThe components of other non-current liabilities were as follows:\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related tax were as follows:\n66\nNOTE 5:\nREPORTING SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\nWe determined our operating segments based on how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") views and evaluates operations.  Various factors, including market separation and customer-specific applications, go-to-market channels, and products and services, were considered in determining these operating segments.  Our CODM regularly reviews our segment operating results to make decisions about resources to be allocated to each segment and assess performance.  In each of our segments, we sell many individual products.  For this reason, it is impracticable to segregate and identify revenue for each of the individual products or group of products we sell.\nOur reportable segments are described below:\n•\nBuildings and Infrastructure:  This segment primarily serves customers working in architecture, engineering, construction, and operations and maintenance.\n•\nGeospatial:  This segment primarily serves customers working in surveying, engineering, and government.\n•\nResources and Utilities:  This segment primarily serves customers working in agriculture, forestry, and utilities.\n•\nTransportation:  This segment primarily serves customers working in long haul trucking and freight shipper markets.\nThe following Reporting Segment tables reflect the results of our reportable operating segments under our management reporting system.  These results are not necessarily in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  This is consistent with the way the CODM evaluates each of the segment's performance and allocates resources.\n67\n68\nA reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes was as follows:\n(1) Unallocated corporate expense includes general corporate expense.\n69\nOn a total Company basis, the disaggregation of revenue by geography is summarized in the tables below.  Revenue is defined as revenue from external customers attributed to countries based on the location of the customer and excludes the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting, consistent with the Reporting Segment tables above.\nTotal revenue in the United States as included in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $\n1,502.3\nmillion, $\n1,641.0\nmillion, and $\n1,518.1\nmillion in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  No single customer or country other than the United States accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018.  No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019.\nProperty and equipment, net by geographic area were as follows:\n70\nNOTE 6:\nDEBT\nDebt consisted of the following:\nEach of our debt agreements requires us to maintain compliance with certain debt covenants, all of which we complied with at the end of fiscal 2020.\nDebt Maturities:\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, our debt maturities based on outstanding principal were as follows (in millions):\nSenior Notes:\nAll series of senior notes in the above table bear interest that is payable semi-annually in June and December of each year.  For the 2023 and 2028 senior notes, the interest rate is subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P (or, if applicable, a substitute rating agency) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the notes.\nSenior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness.  We may redeem the notes of each series of senior notes at our option in whole or in part at any time.  Such indenture also contains covenants limiting our ability to create certain liens, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, and consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets, each subject to certain exceptions.\n71\n2018 Credit Facility:\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, we had access to a $\n1.25\nbillion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in May 2023, which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions.  As part of the credit facility, we may request an additional term loan facility up to $\n500.0\nmillion prior to the maturity of the credit facility and subject to approval.  There were\nno\namounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility at the end of fiscal 2020.\nUncommitted Facilities:\nOn February 24, 2020, we entered into a line of credit to borrow an amount up to £\n55.0\nmillion.  At the end of fiscal 2020, we had\none\n£\n55.0\nmillion,\ntwo\n$\n75.0\nmillion, and\none\n€\n100.0\nmillion revolving credit facilities, which are uncommitted (the \"Uncommitted Facilities\").  Generally, these uncommitted facilities may be redeemed upon demand.  Borrowings under uncommitted facilities are classified as short-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nPromissory Notes and Other Debt\nAt the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, we had promissory notes and other notes payable totaling approximately $\n0.1\nmillion and $\n0.3\nmillion, classified as long-term debt and short-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively.\nNOTE 7:\nLEASES\nWe have operating leases primarily for certain of our major facilities, including corporate offices, research and development facilities, and manufacturing facilities.  Lease terms range from\n1\nto\n10\nyears, and certain leases include options to extend the lease for up to\n6\nyears.  We consider options to extend the lease in determining the lease term.\nOperating lease expense consisted of:\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n(1)\nExcludes cash payments for short-term leases, which are not capitalized.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\n72\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, the maturities of lease liabilities were as follows (in millions):\nWe signed operating leases for real estate of approximately $\n40.0\nmillion that have not yet commenced at the end of fiscal 2020, and as such, have not been recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These operating leases are expected to commence in 2021 with lease terms ranging from\n1\nto\n13\nyears.\nNOTE 8:\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, we had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $\n241.1\nmillion.  These unconditional purchase obligations primarily represent open non-cancelable purchase orders for material purchases with our vendors.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business.  There are no material legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party or of which any of our or our subsidiaries' property is subject.\nNOTE 9:\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nWe determine fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Hierarchical levels are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, and are as follows:\nLevel I - Observable inputs such as unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel II - Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level I) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability.  These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel III - Unobservable inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.  Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.\n73\nFair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe fair value of assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at the end of the period indicated were as follows:\n(1)\nWe have a self-directed, non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain executives and other highly compensated employees.  The plan assets and liabilities are invested in actively traded mutual funds and individual stocks valued using observable quoted prices in active markets.  Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities are included in Other non-current assets and Other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.\n(2)\nDerivative assets and liabilities primarily represent forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rates on certain trade and inter-company receivables and payables.  Derivative assets and liabilities are included in Other current assets and Other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.\n(3)\nContingent consideration liabilities represent arrangements to pay the former owners of certain companies that we acquired.  The fair values are estimated using scenario-based methods or option pricing methods based upon estimated future revenues, gross margins, or other milestones.  At the end of fiscal 2020, we have $\n12.3\nmillion included in Other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The undiscounted maximum payment under the arrangements is $\n18.3\nmillion at the end of fiscal 2020.\nAdditional Fair Value Information\nThe total estimated fair value of all outstanding financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis (debt) was approximately $\n1.8\nbillion and $\n1.9\nbillion at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, consistent with the carrying values.\nThe fair value of our senior notes was determined based on observable market prices in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level II in the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value of the bank borrowings and promissory notes has been calculated using an estimate of the interest rate we would have had to pay on the issuance of notes with a similar maturity and by discounting the cash flows at that rate and is categorized as Level II in the fair value hierarchy.  The fair values do not give an indication of the amount that we would currently have to pay to extinguish any of this debt.\nNOTE 10:\nDEFERRED COSTS TO OBTAIN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS\nDeferred cost to obtain customer contracts of $\n51.3\nmillion and $\n45.4\nmillion is included in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAmortization expense related to deferred costs to obtain customer contracts was $\n22.8\nmillion, $\n22.3\nmillion, and $\n23.6\nmillion, for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  This expense was included in Sales and marketing expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.  There were\nno\nimpairment losses related to the deferred costs for the periods presented.\n74\nNOTE 11:\nDEFERRED REVENUE AND REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\nDeferred Revenue\nChanges in our deferred revenue during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of the end of fiscal 2020, approximately $\n1.3\nbillion of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for which goods or services have not been delivered, primarily subscription, software, maintenance and support, and to a lesser extent, hardware and professional services.  We expect to recognize $\n1.0\nbillion or\n73\n% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue during the next\n12\nmonths.  We expect to recognize the remaining $\n0.3\nbillion or\n27\n% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue thereafter.\n75\nNOTE 12:\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome before taxes and the provision (benefit) for taxes consisted of the following:\nThe difference between the tax provision (benefit) at the statutory federal income tax rate and the tax provision (benefit) as a percentage of income before taxes (\"effective tax rate\") was as follows:\n76\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\"), enacted on March 27, 2020, provides tax relief to individuals and businesses in light of the impacts of COVID-19.  It did not result in material adjustments to our income tax provision or to our net deferred tax assets as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nIn December 2020, due to a change in the Netherlands tax law, the statutory tax rate was increased from\n21.7\n% to\n25.0\n%, effective January 1, 2021.  As a result, we recorded a one-time tax benefit of $\n64.0\nmillion due to the revaluation of the Netherlands deferred tax assets.\nIn December 2019, to align with our international business operations, we completed a non-U.S. intercompany transfer of our intellectual property to a subsidiary in the Netherlands.  The transaction resulted in deferred tax assets in the Netherlands and GILTI deferred tax liabilities in the U.S., recorded at the applicable statutory tax rates, resulting in a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $\n206.3\nmillion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, we have U.S. federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately\n$\n16.7\nmillion and $\n83.4\nmillion, respectively.  The U.S. federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2026.  There is generally no expiration for the foreign NOLs.  Utilization of our U.S. federal and state NOLs is subject to annual limitations in accordance wit\nh the applicable tax code.  We have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize a portion of the foreign NOLs and, accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established for such amount.\nWe have U.S. federal and California research and development credit carryforwards of approximatel\ny $\n11.8\nmillion and $\n33.1\nmillion, respectively.  The U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning 2040.  The California research tax credits\n77\nhave an indefinite carryforward period.  We believe that it is more likely than not that we will not r\nealize a significant portion of the California research and development credit carryforwards and, accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established for such amount.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, we can repatriate foreign earnings back to the U.S. when needed with minimal U.S. income tax consequences, other than the transition tax and GILTI tax.  We reinvested a large portion of our undistributed foreign earnings in acquisitions and other investments and inte\nnd to bring back a portion of foreign cash that was subject to the transition tax and GILTI.  During fiscal 2020, we repatriated $\n272.7\nmillion of our foreign earnings to the U.S.\nThe total amount of the unrecognized tax benefits at the end of fiscal 2020 was $\n64.1\nmillion.  A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefit was as follows:\nTotal unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were\n$\n47.8\nmillion\nand $\n59.5\nmillion at the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes.  Our tax years are substantially closed for all U.S. federal and state income taxes for audit purposes through 2014.  Non-U.S. income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2007.  We are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations state, and foreign (multiple jurisdictions) taxing authorities.  While we generally believe it is more likely than not that our tax positions will be sustained, it is reasonably possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise.  We believe that our reserves are adequate to cover any potential assessments that may result from the examinations and negotiations.\nAlthough timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe that our gross unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next twelve months.\nOur practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.  Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties was recorded in Other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At the end of fiscal 2020 and 2019, we accrued\n$\n9.6\nmillion\nand $\n11.5\nmillion, respectively, for interest and penalties.\nNOTE 13: EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS\nAmended and Restated 2002 Stock Plan\nOn November 20, 2020,\nour stockholders approved an amendment to the 2002 Stock Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance by\n18.0\nmillion shares.  As such, our Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Plan provides for the granting of incentive and non-statutory stock options and RSUs for up to\n92.6\nmillion shares.  At the end of fiscal 2020, the remaining number of shares available for grant under the 2002 stock plan was\n21.1\nmillion.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table summarizes the components of stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the periods indicated:\n78\nStock-based compensation expense was allocated as follows:\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, total unamortized stock-based compensation expense was $\n164.5\nmillion, with a weighted-average recognition period of\n2.4\nyears.\nRestricted Stock Units\nWe grant RSUs containing only service conditions and RSUs containing a combination of service, performance, and/or market conditions (“PSUs”).  RSUs containing only service conditions typically vest ratably over a\nthree\nto\nfour year\nservice period.  PSUs are granted to executive officers and other senior employees and vest after a\ntwo\nto\nthree year\nservice period.\nThe fair value at the grant date is determined by (1) the closing pr\nice of our common stock for awards containing only service or both service and performance conditions, or (2) the Monte Carlo valuation model for awards containing both service and  market conditions.\nFor PSUs granted prior to and during fiscal 2020, the number of shares received at vesting will range from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target grant amount based on either (1) market conditions, (2) performance conditions, or (3) both.  Market conditions consider our relative total stockholder return (“TSR”) of our common stock as compared to the TSR of the constituents of either the S&P 500 or S&P 400 over the vesting period.  Performance conditions consider the achievement of our financial results over the vesting period.\n(1) Includes\n0.2\nmillion PSUs granted,\n0.5\nmillion PSUs vested, and\n1.3\nmillion PSUs outstanding at the end of the year.\n(2) Excludes approximately\n0.2\nmillion PSUs related to achievement above target levels at the vesting date.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of all RSUs granted during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was\n$\n42.50\n, $\n41.38\n, and $\n37.43\nper share, respectively.  The fair value of all RSUs vested during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was\n$\n78.0\nmillion\n, $\n75.7\nmillion, and $\n73.9\nmillion, respectively.\n79\nStock options\nEmployee stock options generally vest after\nthree years\n, or after\nfive years\nfor certain executive awards, with expiration\nseven\nto\nten years\nfrom the date of grant.  The fair value at the grant date is determined by (1) the Black-Scholes valuation model for options with only service conditions, or (2) the Monte Carlo valuation model for certain executive options containing both service and market conditions.\nThe following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at the end of fiscal 2020:\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $\n11.5\nmillion, $\n16.4\nmillion, and $\n30.0\nmillion, respectively.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value per share of stock options granted during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n14.30\n, $\n12.92\n, and $\n10.62\n, respectively.  The fair value of all stock options vested during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was\n$\n0.2\nmillion\n, $\n0.2\nmillion, and $\n1.9\nmillion, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have an ESPP under which the stockholders have approved an aggregate of\n39.0\nmillion shares of common stock for issuance to eligible employees.  The fair value at the grant date is based on the Black-Scholes valuation model.  The plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions at\n85\n% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or at the end of each offering period, which is\nsix months\n.  Rights to purchase shares are granted during the first and third quarter of each fiscal year.  The ESPP terminates on March 15, 2027.  In fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018,\n0.8\nmillion shares were issued, in each fiscal year respectively, representing $\n26.9\nmillion, $\n25.7\nmillion, and $\n24.0\nmillion in cash received for the issuance of stock under the ESPP.  At the end of fiscal 2020, the number of shares reserved for future purchases was\n6.6\nmillion.\nNOTE 14:\nCOMMON STOCK REPURCHASE\nIn November 2017, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (“2017 Stock Repurchase Program”), authorizing us to repurchase up to $\n600.0\nmillion of our common stock.  The 2017 Stock Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date.\nUnder the stock repurchase program, we may repurchase shares from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share buyback programs, tender offers, or by other means.  The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by our management based on our evaluation of market conditions, share price, legal requirements and other factors.  The program may be suspended, modified or discontin\nued at any time without prior notice.  At the end of fiscal 2020, the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds of $\n90.7\nmillion.\nDuring fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, we repurchased approximately\n1.9\nmillion,\n4.7\nmillion, and\n2.4\nmillion shares of common stock in open market purchases, at an average price of $\n43.40\n, $\n38.51\n, and $\n37.23\nper share, for a total of $\n81.6\nmillion, $\n179.8\nmillion, and $\n90.0\nmillion, respectively, under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.\nStock repurchases are reflected as a decrease to common stock based on par value and additional-paid-in-capital, based on the average book value per share for all outstanding shares calculated at the time of each individual repurchase transaction.  The excess of the purchase price over this average for each repurchase was charged to retained earnings.  As a result of the 2020 repurchases, retained earnings was reduced by $\n68.6\nmillion in fiscal 2020.  Common stock repurchases under the program were recorded based upon the trade date for accounting purposes.\n80\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Trimble Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trimble Inc. (the Company) as of January 1, 2021 and January 3, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 1, 2021 and January 3, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 26, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n81\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1986.\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 26, 2021\n82\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Trimble Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Trimble Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Trimble Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of all current year acquisitions, which are included in the 2020 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted less than 1% of tangible assets and net assets as of January 1, 2021, and less than 1% of revenues and net income for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of all current year acquisitions.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 1, 2021 and January 3, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated February 26, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n83\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 26, 2021\n84"

    "text": "(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.  The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\n(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nOur management, including the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).  We have excluded from our evaluation the internal control over financial reporting of all current year acquisitions, which are included in the January 1, 2021 consolidated financial statements and constituted less than 1% of tangible assets and net assets, respectively, as of January 1, 2021, and less than 1% of revenue and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.  Based on the results of this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the end of fiscal 2020.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at the end of fiscal 2020 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included elsewhere herein.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting."
