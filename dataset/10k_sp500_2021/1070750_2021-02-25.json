    "text": "We are the largest publicly traded lodging REIT, with a geographically diverse portfolio of luxury and upper upscale hotels. As of February 19, 2021, our consolidated lodging portfolio consists of 80 primarily luxury and upper-upscale hotels containing approximately 46,300 rooms, with the majority located in the United States, and with five of the hotels located outside of the U.S. in Brazil and Canada. In addition, we own non-controlling interests in five domestic and one international joint venture that own hotels\nand in a timeshare joint venture in Hawaii.\nHost Inc. was incorporated as a Maryland corporation in 1998 and operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT. Host Inc. owns properties and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of the partnership interests (“OP units”) as of December 31, 2020. The remaining partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.’s day-to-day management and control.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur goal is to be the preeminent owner of high-quality lodging real estate in growing markets in the U.S. and to generate superior long-term risk adjusted returns for our stockholders throughout all phases of the lodging cycle through a combination of appreciation in asset values, growth in earnings and dividend distributions. The pillars of our strategy to achieve this objective include:\n1\nGeographically Diverse Portfolio.\nWe seek to have a geographically diversified portfolio in major markets and premier resort destinations in the U.S. We primarily focus on acquisitions and, occasionally, new development opportunities to enhance our portfolio. We have historically targeted acquisitions in the top twenty-five U.S. markets but also consider hotels in other markets which we believe have high growth potential and diverse demand generators. We focus generally on the following types of assets:\nAs one of the largest owners of Marriott and Hyatt properties, our hotels primarily are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Within these brands, we have focused predominantly on the upper-upscale and luxury chain scales, as we believe these have a broad appeal for both individual and group leisure and business customers. In addition, we own several unbranded or soft-branded hotels that appeal to distinctive customer profiles in certain submarkets.\nStrong Scale and an Integrated Platform\nEnterprise Analytics Platform.\nDue to the scale of our asset management and business intelligence platform, we believe we are in a unique position to implement value-added real estate decisions and to assist managers in improving operating performance and profitability. The size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading brands and operators in the industry allow our enterprise analytics team to benchmark similar hotels and identify revenue-enhancement opportunities and cost efficiencies that can maximize the operating performance, long-term profitability and value of our real estate. We perform independent underwriting of return on investment (“ROI”) projects and potential acquisitions, as well as revenue management analysis of ancillary revenue opportunities. Our goal is to continue to differentiate our assets within their competitive markets, drive operating performance and enhance the overall value of our real estate through the following:\nDisciplined Capital Allocation.\nGuided by a disciplined approach to capital allocation, we are equipped to make investment decisions that seek to deliver the greatest value and returns to stockholders. Our goal is to allocate capital to enhance and improve our portfolio, while balancing the importance of prudently returning capital to stockholders.\nWe will continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Despite the challenging economic landscape for lodging in 2021, we constantly are evaluating opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions. This may include the sale of assets where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or properties with significant capital expenditure requirements that we do not believe would generate an adequate return.\nWe may acquire additional properties or dispose of properties through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotel properties to our stockholders. We anticipate that any acquisitions may be funded by, or through a combination of, proceeds from the sales of hotels, equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., incurrence of debt (currently restricted as discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”), available cash or advances under our credit facility. We note, however, that the nature and supply of these assets make acquisitions inherently difficult to predict. For these\n2\nreasons, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in purchasing any one or more hotels that we are reviewing\ncurrently\n, or may in the future review, bid on or negotiate to buy.\nWe also seek to create\nand mine value from our existing portfolio through value enhancement initiatives and ROI projects. We believe these investments provide a significant opportunity to achieve returns well in excess of our cost of capital. We work closely with our managers to attempt to schedule these projects to minimize operational disruption and environmental impact. Value enhancement initiatives seek to maximize the value of real estate within our existing portfolio through the highest and best use of our real estate. These projects may include hotel expansion, timeshare, office space or condominium units on excess land, redevelopment or expansion of existing retail space, and the acquisition of development entitlements. ROI projects are designed to\nimprove the positioning of our hotels within their markets and competitive set. These projects include extensive renovations, including guest rooms, lobbies, food and beverage outlets; expansions and/or extensive renovation of ballroom and meeting rooms; major mechanical system upgrades; and green building initiatives and certifications. It also includes projects focused on increasing space profitability or lowering net operating costs, such as converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space, adding guestrooms, and implementing energy and water conservation measures such as LED lighting, high-efficiency mechanical, electrical and plumbing equipment and fixtures, solar power, energy management systems, guestroom water efficient fixtures, and building automation systems.\nRenewal and replacement capital expenditures are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotels. Typically, renovations occur at intervals of approximately seven to ten years, but the timing may vary based on the type of property, function of area being renovated, hotel occupancy and other factors. These renovations generally are divided into the following types: soft goods, case goods, bathroom and architectural and engineering systems. Soft goods include items such as carpeting, textiles and wall finishes, which may require more frequent updates in order to maintain brand quality standards. Case goods include dressers, desks, couches, restaurant and meeting room tables and chairs, which generally are not replaced as frequently. Bathroom renovations include the refurbishment or replacement of tile, vanity, lighting and plumbing fixtures. Architectural and engineering systems include the physical plant of the hotel, including the roof, elevators/escalators, façade, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and fire systems.\nThroughout the lodging cycle, to the extent that we are unable to find appropriate investment opportunities that meet our return requirements, we will focus on returning capital to stockholders through dividends or common stock repurchases. Significant factors we review to determine the level and timing of the returns to stockholders include our current stock price compared to our determination of the underlying value of our assets, current and forecast operating results and the completion of hotel sales.\nInvestment Grade Balance Sheet\nOur goal is to maintain a flexible capital structure that allows us to execute our strategy throughout the lodging cycle. To maintain its qualification as a REIT, Host Inc. is required to distribute 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gain) to its stockholders each year and, as a result, generally relies on external sources of capital, as well as cash from operations, to finance growth.\nManagement believes that a\nstrong balance sheet\nis a key competitive advantage that affords us a lower cost of debt and positions us for external growth. While we may issue debt at any time, we will target a net debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio, (or “Leverage Ratio,” as defined in our credit facility) that allows us to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. We believe an investment grade rating will give us the most consistent access to capital throughout the business cycle.\nWe seek to structure our debt profile to\nmaintain financial flexibility and a staggered maturity schedule\nwith access to different forms of financing, consisting primarily of senior notes and exchangeable debentures, as well as mortgage debt. Generally, we look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt, minimize near-term maturities and maintain a staggered maturity schedule. Depending on market conditions, we also may utilize variable rate debt which can provide greater protection during a decline in the lodging industry.\nCorporate Responsibility\nWe are committed to creating long-term value through investing responsibly in our business, environment, people and community. Our corporate responsibility program is centered around the concept of responsible investment—an overarching strategy that guides our focus and actions across our three main themes of Environmental Stewardship, Social Responsibility and Governance:\n3\nThe Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”)  outlines the disclosure topics and accounting metrics for the real estate industry. The energy and water management metrics that best correlate with our industry include total energy consumed (“Total Energy Consumption”) and total water withdrawn (“Total Water Consumption”). The energy and water data we use is collected and reviewed by third-parties who compile the data from property utility statements.\nBeginning in 2015, we contracted with a third-party to provide further verification of our energy and water consumption data. The charts below detail our Total Energy Consumption and Total Water Consumption for 2017 through 2019, the last three fiscal years for which data is available\n(1)\n:\nOur expanded and interactive 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report, which details our commitment to corporate responsibility along with our results, performance and progress, including full SASB disclosure, was issued in October 2020.\nThe Lodging Industry\nThe lodging industry in the United States consists of private and public entities that operate in a diversified market under a variety of brand names. The lodging industry has several key participants:\nThe hotel manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the hotel, including the employment of hotel staff, the determination of room rates, the development of sales and marketing plans, the preparation of operating and capital expenditures budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner. The hotel manager typically receives fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel.\nSupply and Demand.\nOur industry is influenced by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms. Lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy, in addition to local market factors that stimulate\n4\ntravel to specific destinations. Trends in economic indicators such as gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth, business investment, corporate profits and employment growth are key indicators of the relative strength of lodging demand. Lodging demand also will be affected by changes to international travel patterns.\nLodging supply growth generally is driven by overall lodging demand, as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development. However, the rate of supply growth also is influenced by several additional factors, including the availability of capital, interest rates, construction costs and unique market considerations. The relatively long lead-time required to complete the development of hotels makes supply growth easier to forecast than demand growth, but increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry, as new supply may be planned during an upcycle but such supply may open for business in a weaker economy. Therefore, as illustrated in the charts below for the U.S. lodging industry, at different points in the cycle, demand growth may accelerate when supply growth is very low, or supply may accelerate while demand growth is slowing. A recent source of supply for the industry has been the rapid growth of online short-term rentals, including as a flexible option for apartment buildings. Though not reported through official industry statistics, the impact on the hotel industry and the availability of these outlets is more variable than typical changes in supply from hotel construction and tends to be very market specific. Local legislation has the potential to limit supply growth for these online short-term rentals in many top markets, though the growth of professional management for legal rentals remains a key trend.\nOur portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale and luxury hotels and, accordingly, its performance is best understood in comparison to the luxury and upper upscale categories rather than the entire industry. The charts below detail the historical supply, demand and revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) growth for the U.S. lodging industry and for the U.S. luxury and upper upscale categories for 2016 to 2020. For 2020, RevPAR and demand both suffered unprecedented declines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, as noted in the charts, the negative scale has been truncated for ease of view and the decline in 2020 is not shown to scale:\nU.S. Lodging Industry Supply, Demand and RevPAR Growth\nSource: STR\n*2020 Supply, Demand and RevPAR estimates reflect economic methodology that assumes no temporary hotel closures\n**Negative scale adjusted\n5\nU.S. Luxury and Upper Upscale Supply, Demand and RevPAR Growth\nSource: STR\n*2020 Supply, Demand and RevPAR estimates reflect economic methodology that assumes no temporary hotel closures\n**Negative scale adjusted\nOur Customers.\nOur customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business. Similar to the majority of the lodging industry, we further categorize business within these broad groups based on characteristics they have in common as follows:\nTransient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers. Business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. Therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand. The four key subcategories of rates offered to the transient business group are:\nGroup business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together, usually with a minimum of 10 rooms. The three key sub-categories of the group business category are:\n6\nContract business refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period at significantly discounted rates. Airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our airport hotels. Contract rates may be utilized by hotels that are in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand.\nManagers and Operational Agreements\nAll our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements, with some of such hotels also subject to separate franchise or license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operations under the designated brand. Under these agreements, the managers have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the day-to-day operation of the hotels, including establishing room rates, securing and processing reservations, procuring inventories, supplies and services, providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers’ technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels. The managers employ all managerial and other employees for the hotels, review hotel operations with a focus on improving revenues and managing expenses, review the maintenance of the hotels, prepare reports, budgets and projections, and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels. These support services include planning and policy services, divisional financial services, product planning and development, employee staffing and training, corporate executive management and certain in-house legal services. We have certain approval rights over budgets, capital expenditures, significant leases and contractual commitments, and various other matters.\nGeneral Terms and Provisions\n– Agreements governing our hotels that are managed by brand owners (Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton and AccorHotels) typically include the terms described below:\n7\n8\nIn addition to hotels managed by brand owners, we have both branded hotels and non-branded hotels operated by independent managers. Our management agreements with independent managers, while similar in operational scope to agreements with our brand managers, typically have shorter initial terms, no renewal rights, more flexible termination rights, and more limited system-wide services. However, while we have additional flexibility with respect to these operators, certain of those hotels remain subject to underlying franchise or licensing agreements. These franchise or licensing agreements allow us to engage independent managers to operate our hotels under the applicable brand names and to participate in the brands’ reservation and loyalty-rewards systems. Under these agreements, we pay the brand owners a franchise or licensing fee equal to a specified percentage of gross room revenues, as well as other system fees and reimbursements. In addition, we are obligated to maintain applicable brand standards at our franchised hotels.\nOperating Structure\nHost Inc. operates through an umbrella partnership structure in which substantially all its assets are owned by Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and holds approximately 99% of the OP units as of December 31, 2020. A REIT is a corporation that has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and that meets certain ownership, organizational and operating requirements set forth under the Code. In general, by payments of dividends to stockholders, a REIT is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level. Each OP unit owned by unaffiliated limited partners other than Host Inc. is redeemable, at the option of the limited partner, for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of Host Inc. common stock multiplied by the current conversion factor of 1.021494. Host Inc. has the right to acquire any OP unit offered for redemption directly from the limited partner in exchange for 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock instead of Host L.P. redeeming such OP unit for cash. Additionally, for every share of common stock issued by Host Inc., Host L.P. will issue .97895 OP units to Host Inc. in exchange for the consideration received from the issuance of the common stock. As of December 31, 2020, unaffiliated limited partners owned 7.2 million OP units, which were convertible into 7.3 million Host Inc. common shares. Assuming that all OP units held by unaffiliated limited partners were converted into common shares, there would have been 712.7 million common shares of Host Inc. outstanding at December 31, 2020.\n9\nOur operating structure is as follows:\nAs a REIT, certain tax laws limit the amount of “non-qualifying” income that Host Inc. and Host L.P. can earn, including income derived directly from the operation of hotels. As a result, we lease substantially all our consolidated hotels to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”) for federal income tax purposes. Our TRS are subject to corporate income tax and are not limited as to the amount of non-qualifying income they can generate, but they are limited in terms of their value as a percentage of the total value of our assets. Our TRS enter into agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the hotels. Our TRS also may own assets engaging in activities that produce non-qualifying income, such as the development of timeshare or condominium units, subject to certain restrictions. The difference between the hotels’ net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to Host L.P. is retained by our TRS as taxable income or loss. Accordingly, the net effect of the TRS leases is that a portion of the net operating cash flow from our hotels is subject to federal, state and, if applicable, foreign corporate income tax.\nOur Consolidated Hotel Portfolio\nAs of February 19, 2021, we owned a portfolio of 80 hotels, of which 75 are in the United States and five are located in Brazil and Canada. Our consolidated hotels located outside the United States collectively have approximately 1,500 rooms. Approximately 1% of our revenues in 2020, and 2% in 2019 and 2018, were attributed to the operations of these five foreign hotels.\nThe lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different categories, each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs: luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper midscale, midscale and economy. Our portfolio primarily consists of luxury and upper upscale properties, which are operated under internationally recognized brand names such as Marriott, Westin, Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt and Hilton. There also has been a trend towards specialized, smaller boutique hotels that are customized towards a particular customer profile. Generally, these hotels will be operated by an independent third-party and either will have no brand affiliation, or will be associated with a major brand, while maintaining most of its independent identity (which we refer to as “soft-branded” hotels).\nRevenues earned at our hotels consist of three broad categories: rooms, food and beverage, and other revenues. While approximately 60% of our revenues in 2020 are generated from rooms sales, the majority of our properties feature a variety of amenities that help drive demand and profitability. Our hotels typically include meeting and banquet facilities, a variety of restaurants and lounges, swimming pools, exercise facilities and/or spas, gift shops and parking facilities, the combination of which enable them to serve business, leisure and group travelers.\n10\nOur consolidated portfolio includes\n3\n2\nhotels\nthat\nhave more than 500 rooms. The average age of our properties is 3\n6\nyears, although substantially all of them have benefited from significant renovations or major additions, as well as regularly scheduled renewal and replacement expenditures and other capital improvements.\nIn our consolidated portfolio\n,\napproximately 8\n8\n% of our hotels, by room count, are managed by their own brand managers, and\n12\n% are managed by independent managers as a franchise or\nas an\nindependent brand.\nBy Brand.\nThe following table details our consolidated hotel portfolio by brand as of February 19, 2021:\n11\nBy Location.\nThe following table details the location\ns\nof\nand number of rooms at our consolidated hotels as of\nFebruary 19, 2021\n:\n12\nBy Market Location:\nWith our geographically diverse portfolio, no individual market represents more than\n1\n2\n% of total revenues. The following chart summarizes the composition of our consolidated hotels as of\nFebruary 19, 2021\nby\neach\nmarket location based on\nits\npercentage of 20\n20\nrevenues:\nOther Real Estate Interests\nWe own non-controlling interests in several entities that, as of February 19, 2021, owned, or owned an interest in, 10 hotels. Due to the ownership structure and economic or participating rights of the partners, we do not consolidate the operations of the properties owned by these entities and they are included in equity in earnings in our consolidated results of operations. Our investments in these entities are as follows:\nAsia/Pacific Joint Venture.\nWe have a 25% interest in an Asia/Pacific JV with RECO Hotels JV Private Limited, an affiliate of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd. The agreement may be terminated by either partner at any time, which would trigger the liquidation of the joint venture. The commitment period for equity contributions to the Asia/Pacific JV has expired. Certain funding commitments remain, however, related to its existing investments in India.\n13\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Asia/Pacific JV has invested approximately $\n109\nmillion (of which our share is $\n27\nmillion) in a separate joint venture in India with Accor S.A. and InterGlobe Enterprises Limited, in which it holds a 36% interest. This joint venture owns seven hotels and an office building in Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai,\nIndia,\ntotaling approximately 1,720 rooms. The hotels are managed by AccorHotels under the Pullman, ibis and Novotel brands.\nMaui Joint Venture.\nWe own a 67% interest in a joint venture with an affiliate of HV Global Group, a subsidiary of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, that owns a 131-unit vacation ownership development in Maui, Hawaii adjacent to our Hyatt Regency Maui Resort & Spa (the “Maui JV”). Since 2012, we have contributed approximately $87 million to the Maui JV, which includes the contribution of land valued at $36 million.\nHyatt Place Joint Venture\n. We own a 50% interest in a joint venture with White Lodging Services that owns the 255-room Hyatt Place Nashville Downtown in Tennessee. The joint venture has a $60 million mortgage loan that is non-recourse to us.\nHarbor Beach Joint Venture.\nWe own a 49.9% interest in a joint venture with R/V-C Association that owns the 650-room Fort Lauderdale Marriott Harbor Beach Resort & Spa in Florida. The joint venture has approximately $150 million of mortgage debt that is non-recourse to us.\nFor additional information see Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4. Investments in Affiliates.”\nCompetition\nThe lodging industry is highly competitive. Competition often is specific to individual markets and is based on several factors, including location, brand, guest facilities and amenities, level of service, room rates and the quality of accommodations. The lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different categories, each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs: luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper midscale, midscale and economy. The classification of a hotel is based on lodging industry standards, which take into consideration many factors, such as guest facilities and amenities, level of service and quality of accommodations. Most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties under such brand names as Andaz\n®\n, Fairmont\n®\n, Grand Hyatt\n®\n, JW Marriott\n®\n, Ritz-Carlton\n®\n, St. Regis\n®\n, The Luxury Collection\n®\nand W\n®\n, or as upper upscale properties under such brand names as Embassy Suites\n®\n, Hilton\n®\n, Hyatt\n®\n, Marriott\n®\n, Marriott Marquis\n®\n, Autograph Collection\n®\n, Curio – A Collection by Hilton\n®\n, Marriott Suites\n®\n, Pullman\n®\n, Sheraton\n®\n, Swissôtel\n®\nand Westin\n®\n.\n(1)\nWhile our hotels compete primarily with other hotels in the luxury and upper upscale category, they also may compete with hotels in other lower-tier categories. A recent source of supply for the lodging industry has been the rapid growth of online short-term rentals, including as a flexible option for apartment buildings. Our hotels also may compete with these short-term rentals in certain markets. In addition, many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from converting, franchising or developing other hotels in our markets. As a result, our hotels compete with other hotels that our managers may own, invest in, manage or franchise.\nWe also compete with other REITs and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities as we attempt to position our portfolio to best take advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers.\nSeasonality\nOur hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate seasonality, which varies based on the individual hotel and the region. In 2020, the sharp decline in hotel sales began in March, when many states and localities implemented mandatory quarantines and travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and varied for the remainder of the year, resulting in hotel sales for our consolidated portfolio that were approximately 66%, 6%, 12% and 16% for the first, second, third and fourth calendar quarters, respectively, in 2020. In 2019, our sales were approximately 26%, 27%, 23% and 24% for the first, second, third and fourth calendar quarters, respectively.\nEnvironmental, Governmental and Regulatory Matters\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances. These laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of hazardous or toxic materials, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released hazardous or toxic materials. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the way property may be used or\n14\nbusinesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures. In connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels, we potentially may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities. Although currently we are not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us, we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future.\nOur hotels also are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety. Under the ADA, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons and we have in the past and may in the future incur capital expenditures to make our hotels accessible\n.\nThese and other building laws and regulations may be changed from time-to-time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. A determination that we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance, the imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the Justice Department or an award of attorneys’ fees to private litigants. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures\n.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of February 19, 2021, we had 163 employees, all of whom work in the United States, including our regional offices in Miami and San Diego. The current average tenure of our employees is more than 10 years and the voluntary and total turnover rates in 2020 were 7.7% and 9.4%, respectively. Our human capital objectives include encouraging individual contributions, reinforcing Host’s EPIC values and culture, maximizing employee engagement and retention and minimizing organizational disruption through succession action plans.  Our employees are given the opportunity to participate in training and education programs such as external training, professional certifications, executive and leadership coaching, continuing education and professional memberships. Additionally, all employees receive annual performance reviews that incorporate our EPIC values of Excellence, Partnership, Integrity and Community, and our competencies, which include adaptability, communication, teamwork and complete thinking. We encourage regular and ongoing feedback tied to performance and career development. In order to ensure that we are meeting our human capital objectives, we conduct employee surveys to obtain feedback on various topics, informing how we execute on specific programs.\nDuring 2020, we launched a formal diversity and inclusion initiative. Our CEO joined the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion initiative in order to continue to advance diversity and inclusion within our workplace. We also provide unconscious bias training to our employees and plan to expand upon this training as part of our participation in the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion initiative. As of December 31, 2020, our total workforce consists of 43% men and 57% women, with 43% of management positions held by women.\nThe number of employees referenced above does not include the hotel employees of our three hotels in Brazil, which, while technically Host employees, are under the direct supervision and control of our third-party hotel managers. The employees at all of our U.S. and Canadian hotels are employees of our third-party hotel managers, who are responsible for hiring and maintaining employees.\nAlthough we do not manage employees at our consolidated hotels, we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force. Employees of our third-party hotel managers at 18 of our hotels, representing approximately 25% of our total room count, are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to review and renewal on a regular basis. For a discussion of these relationships, see Part I Item 1A. “Risk Factors—We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.” None of Host’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nWhere to Find Additional Information\nThe address of our principal executive office is 4747 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 1300, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814.

    "text": "For an enterprise as large and complex as we are, a wide range of factors could materially affect future results and performance. The statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nFinancial Risks and Risks of Operation\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nSince first reported in December 2019,\nthe novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease has spread globally, including to every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19.  The pandemic has significantly adversely impacted U.S. and global economic activity, resulting in a global recession, and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and, in the United States, certain states and cities, including most where we own hotels, have reacted by instituting various restrictive measures such as quarantines, restrictions on travel, \"stay at home\" rules, limitations on the size of gatherings, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, and/or restrictions on the types of construction projects that may continue. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry directly or indirectly and is having an outsized impact on the U.S. lodging industry. Many of our hotels are operating at very low occupancy.\nFor these reasons, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a sharp decline in revenues at our hotels and significantly adversely affected the ability of our hotel managers to successfully operate our hotels and has had a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows due to, among other factors:\nIn addition, quarantines, temporary closures of businesses, states of emergencies and other restrictive measures taken by governments and organizations may negatively impact the ability of our hotel managers to continue to obtain goods and services necessary for the operation of our hotels, obtain necessary personal protective equipment, provide adequate hotel staffing, provide customary levels of hotel services or operate the hotel in a way that facilitates social distancing, all of which may adversely affect the operation of our hotels. The reduced economic activity also may negatively impact future lodging demand even after the restrictive measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic are lifted as, historically, trends in economic indicators such as gross domestic product, business investment, corporate profits and employment growth (all of which have been negatively impacted) all have been key indicators of the relative strength of future lodging demand.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lodging industry are unprecedented and have materially adversely affected our operations.  The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope and severity of the pandemic, the timing of when vaccines become widely available, governmental actions taken to contain the pandemic or to mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The rapid development and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it extremely difficult to assess its full adverse economic impact on our business, financial condition,\n16\nresults of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of heightening our other risk factors disclosed in this section.\nOur revenues and the value of our hotels are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry.\nThe performance of the lodging industry traditionally has been affected by the strength of the general economy and, specifically, growth in gross domestic product. Because lodging industry demand typically follows the general economy, the lodging industry is highly cyclical, which contributes to potentially large fluctuations in our financial condition and our results of operations. Changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers, particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the majority of our hotels are classified as luxury or upper upscale and generally target business and high-end leisure travelers. In periods of economic difficulties, business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce the cost of their trips. Consequently, our hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenues during an economic downturn, as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates.  Other circumstances affecting the lodging industry which may affect our performance and the forecasts we make include:\nWe cannot assure you that adverse changes in the general economy or other circumstances that affect the lodging industry will not have an adverse effect on the hotel revenues or earnings at our hotels. A reduction in our revenues or earnings because of the above risks may reduce our working capital, impact our long-term business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements. In addition, we may incur impairment expense in the future, which expense will affect negatively our results of operations. We can provide no assurance that any impairment expense recognized will not be material to our results of operations.\n17\nIn addition to general economic conditions affecting the lodging industry, new hotel room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industry’s performance and overbuilding has the potential to further exacerbate the negative impact of an economic downturn.  Room rates and occupancy, and thus RevPAR, tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth.  A reduction or slowdown in the growth of lodging demand or increased growth in lodging supply could result in returns that are substantially below expectations or result in losses which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.\nWe depend on external sources of capital for future growth; therefore, any disruption to our ability to access capital at times, and on terms reasonably acceptable to us, may affect adversely our business and results of operations.\nSince we have elected REIT status, Host Inc. must finance its growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because it is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gain) each year in order to qualify as a REIT.  In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to raise additional capital to fund losses and improve our liquidity position.  Our ability to access external capital could be hampered by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\nAs a result of COVID-19, some credit agencies have placed a “negative outlook” on our credit ratings.  If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, our access to capital and the cost of debt financing could be further negatively impacted, particularly if we were downgraded to below an investment grade rating.  The occurrence of any of the above factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on (i) our ability to finance our future growth and acquire hotels, (ii) our ability to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures, and (iii) our results of operations and financial condition.  Potential consequences of disruptions in U.S. and global equity and credit markets could include the need to seek alternative sources of capital with less attractive terms, such as more restrictive covenants, shorter maturity and higher costs which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe lodging industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors are other owners and investors in upper upscale and luxury full-service hotels, including other lodging REITs. Our hotels face strong competition for individual guests, group reservations and conference business from major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands, as well as from other smaller hotel chains, independent and local hotel owners and operators. Our hotels compete for customers primarily based on brand name recognition and reputation, as well as location, room rates, property size and availability of rooms and conference space, quality of the accommodations, customer satisfaction, amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our hotels also compete for customers based on cleanliness protocols adopted in response to the pandemic.  New hotels may be constructed and these additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. Our competitors may have similar or greater commercial and financial resources which allow them to improve their hotels in ways that affect our ability to compete for guests effectively and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.  We also compete for hotel acquisitions with others that have similar investment objectives to ours. This competition could limit the number of investment opportunities that we find suitable for our business. It also may increase the bargaining power of hotel owners seeking to sell to us, making it more difficult for us to acquire new hotels on attractive terms or on the terms contemplated in our business plan.\nThe growth of internet reservation channels also is a source of competition that could adversely affect our business. A significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual or “transient” customers are booked through internet travel intermediaries. Search engines and peer-to-peer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our hotels. If bookings shift to higher\n18\ncost distribution channels, including these internet travel intermediaries, it could materially impact our revenues and profitability. Additionally, as intermediary bookings increase, they may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from the brands and hotel management companies managing and operating our hotels. Also, although internet travel intermediaries traditionally have competed to attract transient business rather than group and convention business, in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business. If that expansion continues, it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and increase our cost of sales for group and convention business and materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nThere are inherent risks with investments in real estate, including their relative illiquidity.\nInvestments in real estate are inherently illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. For this reason, we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel that we desire to sell for the price or on terms acceptable to us, or the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close on the sale of a hotel. Therefore, we may not be able to vary the composition of our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions and dispose of hotels at opportune times or on favorable terms, which may adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders.  In addition, real estate ownership is subject to various risks, including:\nWe have significant indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately $5.5 billion.  We have significantly increased our indebtedness in the past year and have substantially utilized the full $1.5 billion available under the revolver portion of our credit facility in order to increase our cash position and to preserve financial flexibility in light of the impact resulting from COVID-19. Our indebtedness requires us to commit a significant portion of our annual cash flow from operations to debt service payments, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs. Additionally, our substantial indebtedness could:\nIf our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness, we will be required to raise additional funds through sales of common or preferred OP units of Host L.P. or common or preferred stock of Host Inc., the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by Host L.P. (which is currently unavailable to us due to limits placed on incurring additional debt under our senior notes) or sales of our assets. We cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or, if available, will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan.\n19\nThe terms of our indebtedness place restrictions on us and on our subsidiaries and these restrictions reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks.\nWe are, and may in the future become, party to agreements and instruments that place restrictions on us and on our subsidiaries.  For instance, the covenants in the documents governing the terms of our senior notes and our credit facility restrict, among other things, our ability to:\nIn addition, certain covenants in our credit facility also require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial metrics which are currently waived due to the pandemic but which we would not otherwise satisfy.  The restrictive covenants in our senior notes and credit facility reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our indebtedness.  For a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness and the terms of our current waiver under the credit facility, see Part II Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition.”\nOur expenses may not decrease if our revenues decrease.\nMany of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels, such as debt-service payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, are relatively inflexible. They do not necessarily decrease directly with a reduction in revenues at the hotels and may be subject to increases that are not tied to the performance of our hotels or the increase in the rate of inflation generally.  Additionally, certain costs, such as wages, benefits and insurance, may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. In the event of a significant decrease in demand, our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits. Our managers also may be unable to offset any fixed or increased expenses with higher room rates. Any of our efforts to reduce operating costs also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotels.\nOur acquisition of hotels may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.\nWe routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible transactions for acquiring hotels. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions. Our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations. These adverse effects may occur because the performance of the hotel does not support the additional indebtedness and related interest expense that we incurred as a result of the acquisition. In addition, hotels and entities that we have acquired, or may in the future acquire, may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse, or only limited recourse, against the sellers.  In general, the representations and warranties provided in the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and to seek recourse against our sellers and indemnification covering representations and warranties often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses. As a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties.\nWe may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotels.\nWe currently are, and in the future may be, involved in the development or redevelopment of hotels, timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing hotels, including the development of retail, office or apartments, and including through joint ventures. There are risks inherent in any new development, including:\n20\nAny of the above factors could affect adversely our ability to complete the developments on schedule and consistent with the scope that currently is contemplated, or to achieve the intended value of these projects\nWe do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels.\nTo maintain our status as a REIT, we are not permitted to operate or manage any of our hotels. As a result, we, through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, have entered into management agreements with third-party managers to operate our hotels. For this reason, we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels, such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates, food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters. Although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans, the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters. While we monitor the hotel managers’ performance, we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately. The cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name.  Because our management agreements are long-term in nature, we also may not be able to terminate these agreements if we believe the manager is not performing adequately.\nFrom time to time, we have had, and continue to have, disputes with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements.  If we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third-party dispute resolution. Failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations could affect adversely our results of operations.\nIn addition, our hotel managers or their affiliates manage, and in some cases own, have invested in, or provided credit support or operating guarantees, to hotels that compete with our hotels, all of which may result in conflicts of interest. As a result, our hotel managers have in the past made, and may in the future make, decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest. Furthermore, our management agreements for our brand managed properties generally have provisions that can restrict our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer our hotels, unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets other specified conditions. Our ability to finance or sell our hotels, depending upon the structure of the transactions, may require the manager’s consent. Similarly, decisions with respect to the repositioning of a hotel, such as the outsourcing of food and beverage outlets, also may require the manager’s consent.\nThe properties managed by Marriott International account for most of our revenues and operating income. Adverse developments in Marriott’s business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us.\nApproximately 70% of our hotels (as measured by 2020 revenues) are managed or franchised by Marriott International. We rely on Marriott’s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage and maintain our hotel operations efficiently, effectively, profitably and in compliance with the terms, responsibilities and duties of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse developments in Marriott’s business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our hotels and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.\nOur third-party managers are responsible for hiring, maintaining and managing the labor force at each of our hotels. We do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels (other than employing, but not managing, directing or supervising, the employees at our three hotels in Brazil). However, we remain subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly at those hotels with unionized labor. From time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted because of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity. We also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs because of disputes involving our third-party managers and their labor force. The resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, a significant component of our hotel operating costs, either by increases\n21\nin wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. As we are not the employer nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement, we do not negotiate with any labor organization, and it is the responsibility of each\nhotel’s\nmanager to enter into such labor contracts. Our ability, if any, to have any meaningful impact on the outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the individual management agreement covering a specific hotel and we may have little\nor no\nability to control the outcome of these negotiations.\nOur hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace, to maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations. The timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments.\nWe will need to make capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels, to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We also are required by our hotel management agreements to make agreed upon capital expenditures to our hotels. In addition, the timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance, particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels, such as ballrooms, meeting space and restaurants. These capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays. In addition, because we depend on external sources of capital, we may not have the necessary funds to invest and, if we fail to maintain our hotels in accordance with brand standards set by our managers, they may terminate the management agreement. Moreover, we may not necessarily realize a significant, or any, improvement in the performance of the hotels at which we make these investments.\nA large proportion of our hotels are located in a limited number of large urban cities and, accordingly, we could be disproportionately harmed by adverse changes to these markets, a natural disaster or the threat of a terrorist attack.\nHotels in the following cities and markets represented approximately 67% of our 2020 revenues: New York, Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco, Boston, Florida, Hawaii, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. An economic downturn, an increase in hotel supply in these cities and markets, a natural disaster, a terrorist attack or similar disaster in any one of these cities and markets likely would cause a decline in hotel demand and adversely affect occupancy rates, the financial performance of our hotels in these cities and markets and our overall results of operations. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, large urban markets with enhanced restrictions on social gatherings have been disproportionately impacted by the decline in lodging demand. Additionally, in September 2017, our operations in Florida and Houston were impacted negatively by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. The threat of terrorism also may negatively impact hotel occupancy and average daily rate, due to resulting disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety. Hotels in major metropolitan areas, such as the major cities that represent our largest markets, may be particularly adversely affected due to concerns about travel safety.\nWe may acquire or develop hotels in joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts.\nWe have made investments in joint ventures and are exploring further investment or development opportunities. We may, from time to time, invest as a co-venturer in other entities owning hotels instead of purchasing them directly. We also may sell interests in existing hotels to a third-party as part of forming a joint venture with the third-party. Investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present were a third-party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Co-venturers often share control over the operations of a joint venture. Actions by a co-venturer also could subject the hotels to additional risks because our co-venturer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals.  Disputes between us and our partners or co-venturers may result in litigation that would increase our expenses and may negatively impact hotel operations.\nSome potential losses are not covered by insurance.\nWe carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption, cyber threats, terrorism and other risks with respect to all our hotels and other properties. In a limited number of instances, and certain coverages related to hotel managers’ employer status, properties instead may be insured under the hotel manager’s policies. As of February 2021, all consolidated hotels currently are covered under the company’s property insurance. These policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties. Generally, our “all-risk” property policies provide coverage that is available on a per-occurrence basis and that, for each occurrence, has an overall limit, as well as various sub-limits, on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive. Sub-limits exist for certain types of claims, such as service interruption, debris removal, expediting costs, landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes, and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits. The dollar amounts of these sub-limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit. In this regard, hotels in certain of our markets, including California, Florida, Hawaii, Houston, New Orleans and\n22\nSeattle, have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters and the applicable sub-limits are significantly lower than the total value of the hotels we own in states where natural disasters are possible. Recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income. There is no assurance that this insurance, where maintained, will fully fund the re-building or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake, hurricane, or other natural disaster, or a terrorism event, or will fully fund\nt\nhe income lost as a result of the damage. Our property insurance policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub-limits provided in our policies have been exceeded and, in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage, any such claims will be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the manager’s program for the same purpose. Therefore, if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels, the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. Each affected hotel only may receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available. For example, if a hurricane were to cause widespread damage to Florida or up the East Coast, claims from each of our hotels would be aggregated against the policy limit or sub-limit and likely would exceed the applicable limit or sub-limit. We may incur losses in excess of insured limits, and we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or certain types of terrorism.\nIn addition, there are other risks relating to property insurance, such as certain environmental hazards, that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage. Also, insurance coverage for war, infectious disease, and nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological perils is extremely limited.  We also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy. Should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur, or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier, we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a hotel, as well as its anticipated future revenues.\nCyber threats and the risk of data breaches or disruptions of our managers’ or our own information technology systems could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur third-party hotel managers are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to access, process, transmit and store proprietary and customer information. These complex networks include reservation systems, vacation exchange systems, hotel management systems, customer databases, call centers, administrative systems, and third-party vendor systems. These systems require the collection and retention of large volumes of personally identifiable information of hotel guests, including credit card numbers and passport numbers. Our hotel managers may store and process such proprietary and customer information both on systems located at the hotels that we own and other hotels that they operate and manage, their corporate locations and at third-party owned facilities, including, for example, in a third-party hosted cloud environment. These information networks and systems have been and continue to be vulnerable to threats such as system, network or internet failures; computer hacking or business disruption; cyber-terrorism; viruses, worms or other malicious software programs; and employee error, negligence or fraud. These threats can be introduced in any number of ways, including through third parties accessing our hotel managers’ information networks and systems. The risks from these cyber threats are significant and, Marriott International, the manager of a majority of our hotels, experienced a material data security breach involving the unauthorized access to the Starwood guest reservation database between 2014 and 2018.  As of this date, Marriott has been named as a defendant in various lawsuits and investigations arising out of the database breach and no assurances can be made as to the outcome of these lawsuits or investigations.\nWe rely on the security systems of our managers to protect proprietary and hotel customer information from these threats. Any compromise of our managers’ networks could result in a disruption to our managers’ operations, such as the disruption in fulfilling guest reservations, delayed bookings or sales, or lost guest reservations. Any of these events could, in turn, result in disruption of the operations of the hotels that we own that are managed by them, in increased costs and in potential litigation and liability. All our major hotel management companies and a majority of our third-party operators maintain insurance against cyber threats. However, these policies provide varying limits and may be subject to sub-limits for certain types of claims, and it is not expected that these policies will provide a total recovery of all potential losses. In addition, public disclosure, or loss of customer or proprietary information, such as disclosed by Marriott in November 2018, may result in damage to the manager’s reputation and a loss of confidence among hotel guests and result in reputational harm for the hotels owned by us and managed by them, which may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the information technologies and systems of our managers used to operate our hotels, we have our own corporate technologies and systems that are used to access, store, transmit, and manage or support a variety of our business processes. There can be no assurance that the security measures we have taken to protect the contents of these systems will prevent failures, inadequacies or interruptions in system services or that system security will not be breached through physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, and attacks by hackers. Disruptions in service, system shutdowns and security breaches in the information technologies and\n23\nsystems we use, including unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial reporting and compliance, and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, which amounts could be significant.  We currently maintain cyber insurance, which includes coverage for third-party liability (damages and settlements to third parties) and first-party loss (costs incurred by us in response to a network security or privacy event). However, as with our operator’s coverage, our policy is subject to limits and sub-limits for certain types of claims and we do not expect that this policy will cover all the losses that we could experience from these exposures.\nApplicable REIT laws may restrict certain business activities.\nAs a REIT, each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT is subject to various restrictions on the types of revenues it can earn, assets it can own and activities in which it can engage. Business activities that could be restricted by applicable REIT laws include, but are not limited to, developing alternative uses of real estate and the ownership of hotels that are not leased to a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), including the development and/or sale of timeshare or condominium units or the related land parcels. Due to these restrictions, we anticipate that we will continue to conduct certain business activities, including, but not limited to, those mentioned above, in one or more of our TRS. Our TRS are taxable as regular C corporations and are subject to federal, state, local, and, if applicable, foreign taxation on their taxable income.\nWe face possible risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, which can include more frequent or severe storms, droughts, hurricanes and flooding, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our hotels, operations and business. Over time, our coastal markets are expected to experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels causing damage to our hotels. As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance. Other markets may experience prolonged variations in temperature or precipitation that may limit access to the water needed to operate our hotels or significantly increase energy costs, which may subject those hotels to additional regulatory burdens, such as limitations on water usage or stricter energy efficiency standards.  Climate change also may affect our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs at our hotels, such as the cost of water or energy, and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our hotels against such risks. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our hotels, operations or business.\nRisks of Ownership of Host Inc.’s Common Stock\nThere are limitations on the acquisition of Host Inc. common stock and changes in control.\nHost Inc.’s charter and by-laws, the partnership agreement of Host L.P., and the Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”) contain a number of provisions, the exercise or existence of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for Host Inc.’s stockholders or Host L.P.’s unitholders, including the following:\n24\nHost Inc. is subject to the Maryland business combination statute. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the MGCL. There can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.\nFederal Income Tax Risks\nAdverse tax consequences would occur if Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT.\nWe believe that Host Inc. has been organized and has operated in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT under the Code, commencing with its taxable year beginning January 1, 1999, and Host Inc. currently intends to continue to operate and qualify as a REIT during future years. In addition, Host Inc. owns, through Host L.P., one entity that also has elected to be treated as a REIT. As the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a REIT are limited, no assurance can be provided that Host Inc. currently qualifies as a REIT or will continue to qualify as a REIT or that Host Inc.’s subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT or will continue to qualify as a REIT. If our subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that Host Inc. would fail to qualify as a REIT unless it (or the subsidiary REIT) could avail itself of certain relief provisions. If Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and any available relief provisions did not apply, the non-qualifying REIT would not be allowed to take a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its taxable income. Any such corporate income tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the non-qualifying REIT’s cash available for, among other things, operations and dividends to its stockholders. In addition, if Host Inc. were to fail to qualify as a REIT, it would not be required to pay dividends to its stockholders. Moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying REIT could not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification was lost.\nTo qualify as a REIT, Host Inc. is required to satisfy the requirements of several asset and gross income tests. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which assets are not susceptible to a precise determination of fair market value, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT asset and gross income tests requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our gross income and assets on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) will not contend that our hotel leases, interests in subsidiaries, or interests in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the REIT gross income and asset tests requirements.\nAny determination that Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT does not qualify as a REIT will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce materially the value of Host Inc.’s common stock. The additional corporate income tax liability\n25\nof Host Inc. or the subsidiary REIT for the year, or years, in which it does not qualify as a REIT would reduce its cash flow available for investment, debt service or dividends to stockholders. Furthermore, the entity not qualifying as a REIT no longer would be required to pay dividends to its stockholders as a condition to REIT qualification, and any dividends paid to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary C corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that, if Host Inc. were to fail to qualify as a REIT, Host Inc.’s stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on dividends at capital gain tax rates and Host Inc.’s corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject in each case to applicable limitations under the Code. Host Inc.’s failure to qualify as a REIT also would cause an event of default under Host L.P.’s credit facility, which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder, which, in turn, would constitute an event of default under Host L.P.’s outstanding debt securities.\nIf our hotel managers do not qualify as “eligible independent contractors,” or if our hotels are not “qualified lodging facilities,” each of Host Inc. and our subsidiary REIT will fail to qualify as a REIT.\nEach hotel with respect to which our TRS pays rent must be a “qualified lodging facility.” A “qualified lodging facility” is a hotel, motel, or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis, including customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who legally is authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility. We believe that all the hotels leased to our TRS are qualified lodging facilities. However, the REIT provisions of the Code provide only limited guidance for making determinations of whether a hotel is considered a qualified lodging facility, and there can be no assurance that our hotels will be so considered in all cases.\nIf our hotel managers do not qualify as “eligible independent contractors,” Host Inc. and our subsidiary REIT likely will fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Each of the hotel management companies that enters into a management contract with our TRS must qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” under the REIT rules in order for the rent paid to Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT by our TRS to be qualifying gross income for the REIT gross income tests requirements. Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, a hotel manager cannot own more than 35% of our outstanding shares (by value) and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and the ownership interests of the hotel manager, taking into account only owners of more than 5% of our shares and, with respect to ownership interests in such hotel managers that are publicly traded, only owners of more than 5% of such ownership interests. Complex ownership attribution rules apply for purposes of these 35% ownership thresholds. Although we monitor ownership of our shares by our hotel managers and their owners, and certain provisions of our charter are designed to prevent ownership of our shares in violation of these rules, there can be no assurance that these ownership limits will not be exceeded.\nThe size of our TRS is limited and our transactions with our TRS will cause us to be subject to a 100% excise tax on certain income or deductions if such transactions are not conducted on arm’s-length terms.\nA REIT may own up to 100% of the equity interests of an entity that is a C corporation for federal income tax purposes if the entity is a TRS. A TRS may own assets and earn gross income that would not be considered as qualifying assets or as qualifying gross income if owned or earned directly by a REIT, including revenues from hotel operations. Both the REIT and its C corporation subsidiary must jointly elect to treat such C corporation subsidiary as a TRS. A C corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of its stock or securities automatically will be treated as a TRS. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, no more than 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008 and on or before December 31, 2017) of the total value of a REIT’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRS.\nOur TRS will pay federal corporate income tax and applicable state and local corporate income tax and, if applicable, foreign corporate income tax on its taxable income. The after-tax net income of our TRS will be available for distribution to us as a taxable dividend to the extent of its accumulated earnings and profits, but it is not required to be so distributed. We believe that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of our TRS has been and will continue to be less than 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008 and on or before December 31, 2017) of the total value of our assets (including our TRS stock and securities). Furthermore, we monitor the value of our investments in our TRS for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this 20% requirement. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008 and on or before December 31, 2017) value limitation discussed above.\nRent paid to Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT by our TRS cannot be based on its net income or profits for such rents to qualify as “rents from real property.” We receive “percentage rent” from our TRS that is calculated based on the gross revenues of the hotels subject to leases - not based on net income or profits of such hotels. If the IRS determines that the rent paid pursuant to our leases with our TRS are excessive, the deductibility thereof by the TRS may be challenged, and we could be subject to a 100% excise tax on “re-determined rent” or “re-determined deductions” to the extent that such rent exceeds an arm’s-length amount. We believe that our rent\n26\nand other transactions between our REITs and their TRS are based on arm’s-length amounts and reflect normal business practices, but there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with our belief.\nDespite the REIT status of each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT, we remain subject to various taxes.\nNotwithstanding Host Inc.’s status as a REIT, Host Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (including our subsidiary REIT) are subject to federal, state, local and foreign corporate taxes on their net income, gross receipts, net worth, and property, in certain cases. Host L.P. is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes (and any related interest and penalties) incurred by Host Inc.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us.\nNew legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entity’s qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of its REIT qualification. If Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and any available relief provisions did not apply, the non-qualifying REIT would not be allowed to take a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. Moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying REIT could not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification was lost.\nRisks Relating to Redemption of OP Units\nA holder who offers its OP units for redemption may have adverse tax consequences.\nA limited partner who elects to redeem its OP units will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the OP units, resulting in a taxable event to such limited partner.  The gain or loss recognized by the limited partner is measured by the difference between the amount realized thereby and the tax basis in the OP units redeemed (which tax basis includes the amount of the qualified nonrecourse liabilities of Host L.P. allocated to the redeemed OP units). It is possible that the amount of gain and/or the tax liability related thereto that the limited partner recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash received from the redemption of its OP units.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nShares of Host Inc.’s common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of Host Inc.’s common stock.\nWe have in the past issued and may in the future issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, refinance debt or for other corporate purposes. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Host Inc.’s common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could affect adversely prevailing market prices for Host Inc.’s common stock. In addition, limited partners of Host L.P. who redeem their OP units and receive, at Host Inc.’s election, shares of Host Inc. common stock will be able to sell those shares freely. As of December 31, 2020, there are approximately 7.2 million Host LP OP units outstanding that are owned by third parties and that are redeemable, which represents approximately 1% of all outstanding OP units. Further, shares of Host Inc.’s common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans.  We currently maintain two stock-based compensation plans: (i) the comprehensive stock and cash incentive plan, and (ii) an employee stock purchase plan. At December 31, 2020, there were approximately 15 million shares of Host Inc.’s common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan and employee stock purchase plan.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate indebtedness and could impact adversely our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or to sell assets.\nInterest payments for borrowings on our credit facility and the mortgages on certain non-consolidated properties are based on floating rates. As a result, an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes, including investments in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 45% of our debt is subject to floating interest rates.  Rising interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness when it matures and increase interest costs on any indebtedness that is refinanced. We may from time to time enter into agreements such as floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other hedging contracts in order to fully or partially hedge against the cash flow effects of changes in interest rates for floating rate debt. These agreements expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements\n27\nwill be unenforceable. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our hotels, thereby limiting our ability to dispose of them as part of our business strategy.\nA portion of our long-term indebtedness, specifically $2.5 billion of credit facility revolving and term loans, bears interest at floating interest rates based on USD-LIBOR. We expect to transition from LIBOR to another reference rate due to the expected cessation of the LIBOR reference rate. On November 30, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board expressed support for a plan to cease publication of the one week and two month LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021, and the remaining LIBOR rates after June 30, 2023, and encouraged banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as possible. Accordingly, it is highly likely that LIBOR for the primary LIBOR rates under our credit facility will be discontinued after June 2023, and, until our credit facility is modified to provide for a specific benchmark replacement, it is unclear what rate will apply to such credit facility debt. Such transition could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated and adverse consequences.\nCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other government regulations can be costly.\nOur hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety. Under the ADA, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons and we incur capital expenditures to make our hotels accessible. In addition, we have committed to provide, and certain local laws and contracts between our hotel managers and hotel workers’ unions require our hotels to provide, our managers’ employees with safety devices, sometimes known as “panic buttons.” We fund the capital necessary to ensure that employees at our hotels will be equipped with these safety devices. These and other laws and regulations may be changed from time-to-time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. A determination that we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance, imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the Justice Department, or an award of attorneys’ fees to private litigants. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. Any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, the operations of our foreign hotels are subject to a variety of United States and international laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, but we cannot assure that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations.\nLitigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business and are defending these claims vigorously; however, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. We believe, based on currently available information, that the results of current proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any period, depending, in part, upon the quantum of our operating results for such period. We also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels, individuals or companies who use our hotels, our investors, our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental liabilities are possible and can be costly.\nOur hotels are subject to requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. Unidentified environmental liabilities could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. Additionally, even after we have sold a hotel, we may be liable for environmental liabilities that occurred during our ownership. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property. The owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials.\n28"

    "text": "The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.\nThis discussion focuses on our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For a discussion and analysis of the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020.\nOverview\nHost Inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT that owns hotels and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of its common OP units as of December 31, 2020. The remainder of Host L.P.’s common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.’s day-to-day management and control.\nHost Inc. is the largest lodging REIT in NAREIT’s composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotels. As of February 19, 2021, we own 80 hotels in the United States, Canada and Brazil and have minority ownership interests in an additional 10 hotels through joint ventures in the United States and in India. These hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Most of our hotels are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations.\nOur customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business, which accounted for approximately 64%, 30%, and 6%, respectively, of our 2020 room sales. By comparison, our 2019 room sales consisted of 61%, 35%, and 4%, respectively, for transient business, group business and contract business. Transient business broadly represents individual business and leisure travelers. Business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. Therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than by trends in leisure demand. However, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand during the period April 2020 to present has primarily been driven by leisure customers. For a discussion of our customer categories, see “Item 1 Business – Our Customers”.\nCOVID-19 Impact and Response.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly adversely impacted U.S. and global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets beginning in the first quarter of 2020. The adverse economic impact continues as various restrictive measures remain in place in many jurisdictions where we own hotels, including quarantines, restrictions on travel, school closings, limitations on the size of gatherings and/or restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate. As a result, the pandemic continues to negatively impact almost every industry directly or indirectly, including having a severe impact on the U.S. lodging industry generally and our company specifically. The ongoing effects of the pandemic on our operations and future bookings have had, and will continue to have, a material negative impact on our financial results and cash flows, and such negative impact may continue well after restrictive measures imposed by federal, state, local and other governmental authorities to contain the outbreak have been lifted.\nWe have not filed for any relief under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act); however, several of our operators, including Hyatt and Marriott, have filed for the Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”) to partially offset the costs of their furloughed hotel employees under Title II of the CARES Act, as discussed below. Benefits received by our operators from the ERC related to employees at our hotels ultimately will benefit us as we bear the expense for the wages and benefits of all persons working at our hotels.\nIn response to the pandemic, we and our managers, as applicable, have taken the following actions:\n33\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company remains fluid, as does our corporate and property-level response, together with the response of our hotel operators. There remains a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the timing for widespread availability of vaccines and, as a result, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains difficult to predict. We, and our hotel managers, may take additional actions in response to future developments.\nUnderstanding Our Performance\nOur Revenues and Expenses.\nOur hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month, which distribution reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation).\nOperations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 99% of our total revenues and 1% relate to our five hotels in Canada and Brazil. The following table presents the components of our hotel revenues as a percentage of our total revenues:\n34\nHotel operating expenses represent approximately\n97%\nof our total operating costs and expenses. The following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses:\nThe expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. It also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. Taken separately, these costs represent approximately 59% of our rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses.\nKey Performance Indicators.\nThe following key performance indicators commonly are used in the hospitality industry and we believe provide useful information to management and investors in order to compare our performance with the performance of other lodging REITS:\nRevPAR changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit, than do changes that are driven by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage revenues, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, will not result in additional room-related costs, except those charged as a percentage of revenues. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by\n35\nincreases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels.\nWe also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non-GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. We provide a more detailed discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Our non-GAAP financial measures include:\nIn discussing our operating results, we typically present RevPAR and certain other financial data on a comparable hotel basis. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between years. For this reason, we are temporarily suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of December 31, 2020, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019 or 2020; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. We also present RevPAR separately for our consolidated domestic and foreign (both on a nominal and constant dollar basis) hotels. We provide RevPAR results in constant currency due to the consolidated hotels that we own in Canada and Brazil and the effect that exchange rates have on our reporting. We use constant currency because we believe it is useful to investors as it provides clarity on how the hotels are performing in their local markets. For all other measures (net income, operating profit, EBITDA, FFO, etc.), our discussion refers to nominal US$, which is consistent with the presentation of our financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nSummary of 2020 Operating Results\nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations and the significant operating statistics for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except per share and hotel statistics):\nHistorical Income Statement Data:\n36\nAll Owned\nHotel Data:\nN/M = Not meaningful.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues declined $3,849 million, or 70.4%, compared to 2019, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as we experienced a sharp decline in group, business and leisure travel beginning in mid-March 2020. An overall decline in travel as well as the postponement or cancellation of conventions and conferences, music and arts festivals, sporting events and other large public gatherings and on-going travel restrictions have significantly reduced demand at our hotels. All owned hotel pro forma RevPAR decreased 70.3% compared to 2019, on a constant US$ basis, due to a 5,260 basis point decline in occupancy to 26.0%. All owned hotel pro forma Total RevPAR decreased 69.4% for the year\nas food and beverage revenues also experienced significant declines due to the decline in occupancy. (see “Statement of Operations Results and Trends”).\nFollowing RevPAR increases in January and February 2020 across the majority of the portfolio, we experienced unprecedented occupancy declines in the second quarter, followed by modest sequential improvements in the third and fourth quarters. The incremental quarterly improvement in the second half of the year was driven by increased demand in drive-to leisure markets. As a result, all owned hotel Total RevPAR in our Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville and Miami markets declined the least during the year, with decreases of 40.6%, 46.1% and 46.6%, respectively, due primarily to short-term leisure demand in the second half of the year. All owned hotel Total RevPAR at our Phoenix properties declined 51.1% during the year, also benefiting from leisure business, which led to strong golf revenues at two of our properties in that market, while all owned hotel Total RevPAR at our Maui/Oahu properties declined 69.6%, with operations suspended for three of our hotels through the third quarter followed by hotel reopenings and loosening travel restrictions in the fourth quarter. Our hotels in San Francisco/San Jose and New York, our two largest markets by room count, experienced declines in all owned hotel Total RevPAR of 74.5% and 80.3%, respectively, due to suspension of operations for a portion of the year at several of these hotels. The largest all owned hotel Total RevPAR declines occurred in our Boston and Chicago markets, with decreases of 84.8% and 82.7%, respectively, as operations remain suspended at the Sheraton Boston Hotel and the Westin Chicago River North.\nOperating Profit\nOperating profit margins (calculated based on GAAP operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenues) declined in 2020 to (58.8)% due to the decline in operations from the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profit margins under GAAP also are affected significantly by several items, including dispositions, depreciation expense and corporate expenses. Our all owned hotel pro forma EBITDA margins, which exclude these items, declined to (8.5)% for the year.\n37\nNet Income, Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nand Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share\nNet income for Host Inc. decreased $1,673 million in 2020 to a loss of $741 million primarily due to the decline in operations from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a $132 million decrease in other gains/(losses), consisting primarily of lower gain on sale of assets in 2020 as compared to 2019. These results led to a diluted loss per common share for Host Inc. of $1.04. Adjusted EBITDA\nre,\nwhich excludes, among other items, gain on sale of assets, impairment expense and severance expense, decreased to $(168) million for the year, while Adjusted FFO per diluted share, which excludes gain on sale of assets and other real estate transactions, including depreciation, impairment and severance, decreased to $(0.17) in 2020.\nThe trends and transactions described above for Host Inc. affected similarly the operating results for Host L.P., as the only significant difference between the Host Inc. and Host L.P. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the unaffiliated limited partners of Host L.P.\n2021 Outlook\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted macroeconomic and industry expectations for 2021. While economic growth and business investment are expected to accelerate meaningfully in 2021, supported by further stimulus, low interest rates, and vaccine distribution, government-imposed restrictions across the U.S. remain. Many regions continue to grapple with the early 2021 surge in outbreaks and new variants of the virus, which has resulted in elevated jobless claims and slower economic activity in the first part of the year. While forecasts for 2021 remain uncertain, Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus currently estimates an increase in real GDP of 4.9% for the year, while business investment is anticipated to increase 6.8%. Though analysts believe the unemployment rate peaked in 2020, it is anticipated to remain elevated into 2021, with an expected average of 5.8% for the year. The range of potential outcomes on the economy and the lodging industry specifically is exceptionally wide, reflecting both the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and varying analyst assumptions surrounding infection rates, new virus variants and the timing of vaccine deployments.\nHotel supply growth is anticipated to remain below the long-term historical average in 2021, as social distancing measures and supply chain challenges resulted in project delays across the U.S. A large percentage of U.S. hotels closed temporarily in 2020, and while many have begun to reopen, we anticipate that the number of permanent hotel closures will be higher than historical averages. The pandemic’s outsized impact on our industry has resulted in a breakdown of the relationship between increased business investment and RevPAR growth. RevPAR recovery is anticipated to lag that of the broader U.S. economy, despite lower supply growth. Luxury and upper upscale hotels in top markets, where a majority of our hotels are located, have been most heavily affected by the pandemic, due in part to the sharp decline in air travel, particularly from international arrivals, and the slower recovery of corporate and group demand. While we have seen slightly improving trends, we anticipate that these factors will persist in 2021.\nAs a result of the significant uncertainties related to the timing of vaccine deployment, further government stimulus and related policy, and resulting broader macroeconomic trends in 2021, we anticipate that the industry outlook will continue to be weighed down by the slow return of corporate and group travel, as businesses likely will remain cautious. While investor optimism has grown in the early part of 2021 as analysts focus on the potential for significant pent-up leisure demand, existing corporate policies are expected to continue to constrain nonessential business transient and group travel until the country approaches herd immunity. Given the unprecedented and unpredictable nature of the pandemic and its effect on our industry, we are not able to provide a full year forecast for RevPAR at this time. We believe that recovery within the lodging industry is highly dependent on the strength of the economy, consumer confidence and, especially with respect to corporate and group travel, the timing of vaccine deployment. Accordingly, we believe the recovery in 2021 likely will be gradual and that the impact on specific markets and industries will be uneven.\nAs noted above, the current outlook for the lodging industry remains highly uncertain. There can be no assurances as to the timing for a recovery in lodging demand for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated return of group and business travel. For more information on the risks that can affect our future results, see Part 1 Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”\nStrategic Initiatives\nFor 2021, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation in order to strengthen our portfolio and to deliver stockholder value through multiple levers, which may include, over time, acquiring hotels or investing in our portfolio. We intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to acquire upper-upscale and luxury properties, through single asset or portfolio acquisitions, that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive long-term value to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise as a result of the pandemic. At the same time, we will opportunistically sell hotels when market conditions permit, including the pursuit of exiting the Brazil and Canada markets in order to focus on our domestic portfolio. We also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to seek to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate for its highest and best use.\n38\nDispositions\n.\nWe completed the sale of\nthe Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa\nin 20\n20\nfor\nnet\nproceeds of approximately\n$202\nmillion\n. Additionally, in transactions completed\nduring the year,\nwe sold a total of\n38\nacres of land adjacent to The\nPhoenician\nfor $\n83\nmillion\n.\nFinancing transactions\n.\nSenior Notes.\nOn August 20, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Series I senior notes and on September 3, 2020, we completed the issuance of an additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of Series I senior notes, for total proceeds of approximately $733 million, net of discounts, underwriting fees and expenses. The Series I senior Notes have been designated as green bonds, as an amount equal to the net proceeds will be allocated to eligible green projects. A portion of the proceeds were used in August 2020 to repay approximately 81% of the outstanding 4.75% Series C senior notes due 2023 for $390 million, including $26 million of prepayment costs. Additionally, the remaining $86 million of Series C senior notes were redeemed in December 2020 for $94 million, including a premium of approximately $8 million. This eliminated the final series of senior notes issued before we attained an investment grade rating, and therefore any covenants or restrictions under our non-investment grade senior notes indentures no longer are applicable.\nCredit Facility.\nDuring the year, we had a net draw of $1,483 million under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Additionally, in June 2020 and February 2021, we amended the terms of our credit facility, under which t\nhe quarterly-tested financial maintenance covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022\n.\nFollowing the covenant waiver period, certain financial maintenance covenants are modified through the third quarter of 2023.\nWe believe that our ability to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and well-laddered maturity schedule is an important factor in our investment strategy. Through our transactions in 2020, we were able to lower our weighted average interest rate to 3.0% at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.8% at December 31, 2019, and extended our weighted average debt maturity to 5.0 years. We have a debt balance of $5.5 billion and no significant debt maturities until 2023.\nFor a detailed discussion, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” For a detailed discussion of our significant debt activities, see Part II Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5.  Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital Projects.\nWe continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements, including projects that are designed to increase the eco-efficiency of our hotels, incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology. During 2020, we spent approximately $499 million on capital expenditures, of which $343 million represented return on investment (“ROI”) capital expenditures and $156 million represented renewal and replacement projects.\nIn collaboration with Marriott, we initiated a transformational capital program in 2018 on an initial 17 properties, now 16 properties following the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa, that is expected to occur over a four-year period. We believe these investments will make these hotels more competitive in their respective markets and will enhance long-term performance through increases in RevPAR and market yield index. To accelerate this process, we agreed to invest amounts in excess of the FF&E reserves required under our management agreements, or approximately an average of $175 million per year, which amounts are included in the forecast range of 2021 capital expenditures reflected below. In exchange, Marriott has provided additional priority returns on the agreed upon investments and operating profit guarantees of $83 million, before reductions for incentive management fees, over the four years to offset expected business disruption.\nOf the 16 properties included in the program, we substantially completed the projects at the Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa, New York Marriott Downtown, San Francisco Marriott Marquis, and Santa Clara Marriott in 2019 and projects at the Minneapolis Marriott City Center, San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter\nand\nJW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead in 2020. W\nork is underway at seven other properties. Approximately 65% of the total estimated costs of the transformational capital program have been spent as of December 31, 2020 and, in 2021, we expect to substantially complete four additional properties, including:  The Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island, New York Marriott Marquis, Houston Medical Center Marriott and Orlando World Center Marriott.\nIn 2021, we also have several projects scheduled to be completed or initiated that seek to add value to our existing portfolio over time. These include:\n39\nFor 2021, we expect to make capital expenditures of $375 million to $475 million, including approximately $110 million to $140 million for the Marriott transformational capital program discussed above,\nwhich is expected to be nearly 85% complete by year-end 2021. We received approximately $19 million in operating profit guarantees in 2020 from Marriott and expect to receive approximately $16 million in 2021. The total expected capital spend consists of $275 million to $325 million of ROI projects and $100 million to $150 million of renewal and replacement projects. We have established key milestones to review major projects prior to implementation, with the ability to reduce 2021 capital expenditures by approximately $150 million, if required, to conserve cash.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends.\nOn August 5, 2019, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized an increase in its share repurchase program from $500 million to $1 billion. In the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased 8.9 million common shares at an average price of $16.49 per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $147 million, prior to suspending our repurchases in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, we had $371 million available for repurchase under the program. Repurchases are currently restricted under the terms of our credit facility amendment.\nDuring 2020, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per share in the first quarter, with respect to Host Inc.’s common stock. Accordingly, Host L.P. made distributions of $0.2042988 per unit with respect to its common OP units for 2020.\nAs part of its response to COVID-19 and in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility, Host suspended its regular quarterly common cash dividend\ncommencing with the second quarter dividend that would have been paid in July 2020.\nThere can be no assurances as to when dividends will be restored but, based on the terms of the credit facility amendments, we are restricted to paying a quarterly common cash dividend of $0.01 per share or higher amounts to the extent necessary to allow Host Inc. to maintain REIT status or to avoid corporate income or excise taxes, until after the covenant waiver period expires following the second quarter of 2022. The amount of any future dividends will be based on our policy of distributing, over time, 100% of our taxable income and will be determined by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors. However, while the dividend is suspended to preserve cash and liquidity, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to fund our capital expenditures programs and to take advantage of investment opportunities.\n40\nResults of Operations\nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages):\nN/M = Not meaningful\nStatement of Operations Results and Trends\nThe following table presents revenues in accordance with GAAP for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages):\nThe significant decline in revenues was due predominantly to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began to significantly impact hotel operations beginning in March of 2020. After a significant decline in revenues in the second quarter, revenues gradually improved through subsequent quarters, although they remained well below historical levels. Our 2020 revenues on a quarterly basis were as follows:\nRooms\n. Total rooms revenues decreased $2,455 million, or 71.6%, in 2020. Rooms revenues in 2019 include $196 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.\nFood and beverage\n. Total F&B revenues decreased $1,221 million, or 74.1%, in 2020. F&B revenues in 2019 include $77 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.\nOther revenues\n. Total other revenues decreased $173 million, or 44.2%, in 2019. Attrition and cancelation fees increased $3 million compared to 2019. Other revenues in 2019 include $26 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.\n41\nProperty-level Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents consolidated property-level operating expenses in accordance with GAAP for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages):\nOur operating costs and expenses, which consist of both fixed and variable components, are affected by several factors. Rooms expenses are affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Food and beverage expenses correlate closely with food and beverage revenues and are affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet and audio-visual and outlet sales. However, the most significant expense for the rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses is wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 59% of these expenses in any year. During 2020, these expenses declined 54% compared to 2019, excluding the severance expense discussed below. Included in these amounts in 2020 is $125 million for benefits to hotel employees who were furloughed by our managers and special pay, partially offset by approximately $39 million related to the ERC recorded by our managers. We also\nrecorded $65 million of severance costs in 2020, which has been excluded from the wage and benefit discussions below\n. Other property-level expenses consist of property taxes, which are highly dependent on local taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.\nThe decline in expenses for rooms, food and beverage, other departmental and support, and management fees predominantly are due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as follows:\nRooms\n. Rooms expenses decreased $511 million, or 58.5%, during 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 71% of our 2020 rooms expenses and 66% of our 2019 rooms expenses.\nFood and beverage.\nF&B expenses decreased $700 million, or 62.5%, in 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 74% of our 2020 F&B expenses and 70% of our 2019 F&B expenses.\nOther departmental and support expenses\n. Other departmental and support expenses decreased $609 million, or 47.0%, in 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 44% of our 2020 other departmental and support expenses and 41% of our 2019 other departmental and support expenses.\nManagement fees\n. Total management fees decreased $200 million, or 83.7%, in 2020.\nBase management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, decreased $119 million, or 72.1%, compared to 2019. Incentive management fees, which generally are based on the amount of operating profit at each hotel after we receive a priority return on our investment, decreased $91 million, as we did not pay incentive management fees during 2020.\nOther property-level expenses\n. These expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. Other property-level expenses decreased $53 million, or 14.5%, in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in rent on a portion of our ground leases that are based on a percentage of sales. Other property-level expenses were partially offset by the receipt of operating profit guarantees from Marriott under the transformational capital program in both 2020 and 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $11 million, or 1.6%, to $665 million in 2020, due to impairment expense that was recorded in 2019.\n42\nOther Income and Expense\ns\nCorporate and other expenses\n.\nCorporate and other expenses include the following items (in millions):\nGeneral and administrative costs primarily consist of wages and benefits, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, audit fees, building rent and systems costs. In 2020, corporate and other expenses declined by approximately 17% compared to 2019, as a result of r\neduced compensation, travel and other overhead.\nIn 2019, corporate and other expenses include costs associated with a significant transformation of our corporate information systems platform, the implementation of which was completed in the second quarter of 2019.\nGain on insurance and business interruption settlements\n.\nIn 2019, we received $27 million of property insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Irma, that occurred in 2017, resulting in a gain of $4 million.\nInterest income.\nInterest income decreased $24 million, or 75.0%, in 2020 due to a decline in interest rates.\nInterest expense\n.\nInterest expense decreased $28 million, or 12.6%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, reflecting the benefits from refinancing activities in 2019 and 2020 as well as a decline in floating interest rates, which was partially offset by increased principal balances outstanding due to the credit facility draw. Interest expense for 2020 also reflects less prepayment premiums on the repayment of the Series C senior notes compared to the prepayment premiums paid in 2019 on the Series Z and Series B senior notes. The following table presents certain components of interest expense (in millions):\nOther gains/(losses).\nThe following table presents the gains recognized on the sale of assets and other (in millions):\n43\nEquity in earnings (losses) of affiliates\n. In 2020, we recorded a loss of $\n30\nmillion related to our unconsolidated investments\n.\nThis included a $14 million\nloss\nfor\nour share of\nan\ninventory impairment expense recorded by our Maui timeshare joint venture\n, in addition to operating losses\nincurred\nby our investments. In 2019\n,\nwe recorded earnings of $\n14\nmillion from our unconsolidated investments.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes.\nWe lease substantially all our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable income or loss generated/incurred by the TRS primarily represents hotel-level operations and the aggregate rent paid to Host L.P. by the TRS, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. In 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $220 million due primarily to the domestic net operating loss incurred by our TRS.\nAs a result of legislation enacted by the CARES Act, such domestic net operating loss may be carried back up to five years in order to procure a refund of U.S. federal corporate income taxes previously paid. Any domestic net operating loss incurred by our TRS not carried back pursuant to these rules may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limit on the use thereof of 80% of annual taxable income.\nWe expect to generate additional net operating losses from our TRS in 2021 and we will evaluate whether or not to record an income tax benefit for all or a portion of such net operating loss at that time. The 2019 income tax provision of $30 million primarily related to hotel operations at our TRS. See also Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7. Income Taxes” for a discussion of our income taxes.\nHotel RevPAR Overview\nTo facilitate a year-over-year comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics for the periods included in this presentation on a comparable hotel basis. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we are revising our presentation to instead present pro forma hotel operating results for all hotels. See “All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics” for a complete description of our methodology. We also discuss our Hotel RevPAR results by geographic location and mix of business (i.e., transient, group, or contract).\n44\n20\n20\nCompared to 201\n9\nHotel Operating Data by Location\n.\nThe following table sets forth performance information for our hotels by geographic location as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nAll Owned Hotels (pro forma) by Location in Constant US$\n(1)\n45\nHotel Sales by Business Mix.\nThe majority of our customers fall into three broad categories:  transient, group and contract business. The information below is derived from business mix results from the 79 hotels owned as of December 31, 2020.\nThe following are the results of our consolidated portfolio transient, group and contract business:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nThe liquidity and capital resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are derived primarily from the activities of Host L.P., which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations, the incurrence of debt, the issuance of OP units or the sale of hotels. Host Inc. is a REIT and its only significant asset is the ownership of general and limited partner interests of Host L.P.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through Host L.P., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. Proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances by Host Inc. are contributed to Host L.P. in exchange for common and preferred OP units. Additionally, funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase its stock are provided by Host L.P. Therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P., we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion below applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nOverview.\nWe look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility of the lodging industry. We believe this strategy has resulted in a better cost of debt capital, allowing us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and it positions us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle. We have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. Currently, none of our consolidated hotels are encumbered by mortgage debt. Over the past several years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had decreased our leverage as measured by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and reduced our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result, the company was well positioned at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to withstand the severe slowdown in U.S. economic activity and lodging demand brought on by the pandemic. We were able to take further steps in 2020 to bolster our liquidity position as outlined below.\nUnder the current challenging operating environment posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to preserve liquidity by drawing on our credit facility, working with our hotel operators to reduce operating costs at the hotel, reducing corporate level expenses, suspending our quarterly dividend and stock repurchases and deferring certain capital expenditures projects to future years. These actions contributed to lowering our cash used in operating activities each quarter following the beginning of the pandemic. We intend to use available cash in the near term predominantly to fund negative operations at our hotels, corporate expenses and reduced levels of capital expenditures. However, we also are well positioned to execute acquisitions to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise.\n46\nDespite the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, we believe\nthat\nwe have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current decline in operating cash flow and to fund our capital expenditures programs. We may access equity markets if favorable conditions exist in order to enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs, including to fund acquisitions or other investment opportunities generated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe following summarizes the change in cash flows from 2\n019 to 2020 for significant items that affected our cash balance and reflect\ns\nour actions to preserve financial liquidity:\nCash Requirements.\nWe use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, and corporate and other expenses, as well as for dividends and distributions to stockholders and Host L.P. limited partners and stock and OP unit repurchases. Our primary sources of cash include cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances. Our cash obligations include the minimum lease payments on our ground leases, which in 2021 are approximately $32 million. For a summary of our obligations under our ground leases, see Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report. Our ground lease payments are the longest time horizon obligations and currently run up to 91 years, while other operating obligations are generally short term in nature. We have no significant debt maturities until 2023.\nIn addition to the liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, under our capital expenditures program, we have budgeted to spend $375 million to $475 million in 2021, but have the ability to reduce this spend by approximately $150 million if required to conserve cash.\nCommitments for capital expenditures generally run less than two years for the life of the project.\nAs a REIT, Host Inc. is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. As part of our COVID-19 response, our regular quarterly common cash dividend currently is suspended and we are restricted from repurchasing stock or OP Units under the terms of our credit facility amendment as discussed below. See also Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17. Legal Proceedings, Guarantees and Contingencies” for a discussion of obligations under contingent liabilities or guarantees.\nCapital Resources.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $2,335 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $139 million in our FF&E escrow reserve. We have substantially utilized the $1.5 billion revolver under our credit facility to increase our liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the near term, we expect to fund our above cash requirements, including our capital expenditures program, debt payments, operating and corporate costs, primarily with our existing cash reserves due to the negative operating cash from operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our cash balance at December 31, 2020 and our expected cash obligations, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our near-term obligations, even if our hotel operations remain at current negative operating levels.\nWe depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Our financial flexibility (including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends, make distributions and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility and senior notes, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges.\nFollowing the amendments of our credit facility agreement discussed below, the quarterly-tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022. However, we currently are below the interest coverage ratio required under our senior notes indentures to incur additional debt and, while not an event of default, we will be unable to incur additional debt while we remain below the required covenant level.\n47\nGiven the total amount of our debt and our maturity schedule, we\nmay\ncontinue to redeem or\nrepurchase\nsenior notes from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions\n. In\nFebruary\n20\n2\n1\n, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of senior notes other than in accordance with their respective terms, of which the entire amount remains available under this authority. We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the accelerated expensing of previously deferred and capitalized financing costs. Accordingly, considering our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws\nand the requirement\ns\nof our credit facility and senior notes\n, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes or the repurchase or sale of\nour\ncommon stock. Any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously.\nIn February 2017, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of Host Inc. common stock, and on August 5, 2019, authorized an increase in the program to $1 billion. The common stock may be purchased from time to time depending upon market conditions and may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions or by other means, including principal transactions with various financial institutions, like accelerated share repurchases, forwards, options, and similar transactions and through one or more trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number or any specific dollar amount of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. Under the terms of our credit facility amendment in 2020, we currently are restricted from repurchasing stock.\nWe continue to explore potential acquisitions and dispositions. We anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of hotels, but also potentially from equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P.,  or available cash. Given the nature of these transactions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase or that we will be successful in disposing of any one or more of our hotels. We may acquire additional hotels or dispose of hotels through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders.\nSources and Uses of Cash.\nIn 2020, our primary sources of cash included proceeds from the issuance of debt, draws on our credit facility revolver and dispositions. Our primary uses of cash during the year consisted of capital expenditures, operating costs, debt repayments, repurchases of common stock and distributions to equity holders. We do not anticipate significant cash from operations in 2021 and we are restricted from issuing debt under the covenants of our senior notes indenture. However, we have significant available cash and also have access to stock issuances and property dispositions as alternative sources of cash. Primary uses of cash are expected to include continued funding of operating shortfalls at our properties, interest and other corporate expenses and capital expenditures. Subject to market conditions, other uses of cash may include property acquisitions or other investments.\nCash Provided by/Used in Operations\n. Our net cash used in operations for 2020 was $307 million compared to cash provided by operations in 2019 of $1,250 million due primarily to the decline in operations at our properties due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to fund operating shortfalls at our properties.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, our portfolio provided cash from operations due to positive operating results in January and February. However, beginning with the second quarter, we experienced significant cash outflows from operating activities which continued through the second half of the year. However, net cash used in operations did decrease in each sequential quarter as a result of reducing operating costs at our hotels and the slightly improving levels of operations. The following presents the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for each quarter in 2020:\nCash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities\n. Approximately $195 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2020 compared to $58 million provided in 2019. In addition to the acquisition and disposition activity detailed in the charts below, we spent approximately $499 million on capital expenditures in 2020, compared to $558 million in 2019. These amounts include certain internal costs and interest expense associated with our capital expenditures projects that have been capitalized in accordance with GAAP. These capitalized costs were $12 million, $12 million and $11 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n48\nThe following tables summarize significant acquisitions, dispositions and return of investments in affiliates from January 1, 201\n9\nthrough\nFebruary 19, 2021\n(in millions):\nCash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities\n. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,231 million for 2020, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1,315 million in 2019. Cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of the issuance of $750 million of 3.5% Series I senior notes and a draw on the credit facility,\nwhile 2019 included the issuance of $650 million of senior notes. Cash used in financing activities in 2020 included the repayment of the Series C senior notes, with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Series I senior notes, and the redemption of preferred OP units and cash used in 2019 included the repayment of senior notes. While cash used in 2020 and 2019 both included stock repurchases and dividend payments, payments in 2020 for these items were $638 million lower compared to 2019, as we suspended dividends and repurchases in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe following table summarizes significant issuances, net of deferred financing costs and issuance discounts, that have been completed from January 1, 2019 through February 19, 2021 (in millions):\n49\nThe following table presents significant debt repayments, including prepayment premiums, that have been completed from January 1, 201\n9\nthrough\nFebruary 19, 2021\n(in millions):\nEquity/Capital Transactions.\nThe following table summarizes significant equity transactions that have been completed from January 1, 2019 through February 19, 2021 (in millions):\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total debt was approximately $5.5 billion, of which 55% carried a fixed rate of interest. Total debt was comprised of the following (in millions):\n_________\n50\nAggregate debt maturities at December 31, 20\n20\nare as follows (in millions):\nSenior Notes.\nOn August 20, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Series I senior notes and on September 3, 2020, we completed the issuance of an additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of Series I senior notes. The proceeds were used to make a tender offer for our Series C senior notes and to improve our liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Series I senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the September 15, 2030 maturity date, except at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The Series I senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes.\nThe following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing the various senior notes issued by Host L.P., to which we refer collectively as the senior notes indenture. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.’s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P. Currently there are no guarantees provided to the senior notes, but we have agreed that all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guarantee other Host L.P. debt must similarly provide guarantees to the senior notes.\nAll of our outstanding senior notes at December 31, 2020 were issued after we attained an investment grade rating and have covenants customary for investment grade debt and covenants that are similar to each other series of our senior notes. These covenants are primarily limitations on our ability to incur additional debt. There are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.\nUnder the terms of our senior notes, Host L.P.’s ability to incur debt is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5x by Host L.P. As calculated, this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on Host L.P.’s audited consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the calculation is based on Host L.P.’s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Other covenants limiting Host L.P.’s ability to incur debt include maintaining total debt of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), maintaining secured debt of less than 40% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured debt of Host L.P. and its subsidiaries. So long as Host L.P. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may incur additional debt.\nThe following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of December 31, 2020:\n51\nWe are in compliance with certain of the financial ratios applicable to our senior notes as of\nDecember\n3\n1\n, 2020,\nbut\nwe fell below the 1.5x requirement for the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio\nstarting\nas of the end of the third quarter of 2020 and, as a result,\nwhile not in default,\nwe will not be able to incur additional debt while the ratio remains below this requirement.\nWe expect to continue to be below the 1.5x interest coverage ratio and hence\nwill be\nunable to incur additional debt until operations substantially improve from current levels.\nCredit Facility.\nOn August 1, 2019, we entered into the fifth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as co-syndication agents, and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion (which is substantially fully utilized). The revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, British pounds sterling and, if available to the lenders, Mexican pesos, of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $500 million, subject to a lower amount in the case of Mexican peso borrowings. The credit facility also provides for a term loan facility of $1 billion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $100 million for swingline borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars and a subfacility of up to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. Host L.P. also has the option to add in the future $500 million of commitments which may be used for additional revolving credit facility borrowings and/or term loans, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments (which we have not currently obtained) and the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nThe revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity date of January 11, 2024, which date may be extended by up to a year by the exercise of up to two 6-month extension options, each of which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties. One $500 million term loan tranche has an initial maturity date of January 11, 2024, which date may be extended up to a year by the exercise of one 1-year extension option, which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee; and the second $500 million term loan tranche has a maturity date of January 9, 2025, which date may not be extended.\nNeither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans, as applicable, requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity, other than those required during the Covenant Relief Period as set forth below. The term loans are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees, operational covenants, financial covenants and events of default (as discussed below).\nGuarantees.\nSimilar to our senior note indentures, the credit facility requires all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guaranty Host L.P. debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility. Currently, there are no such guarantees.\nPrepayments.\nVoluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty.\nFinancial Covenants.\nThe credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. We are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA (“leverage ratio”) is not in excess of 7.25x, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.25x. Except as set forth below during the Covenant Relief Period, these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan in order to establish its fair value and non-cash interest expense, all of which are included in interest expense on our audited consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a “net debt” concept, pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million are deducted from our total debt balance.\nAmendments\n.  On June 26, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility and on February 9, 2021, we entered into a second amendment to the credit facility (collectively, the “Amendments”). The Amendments suspend requirements to comply with all existing financial maintenance covenants under the credit facility for the period which began on July 1, 2020 and ending on the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022 (such period, the “Covenant Relief Period”). The existing financial maintenance covenants are reinstated for the quarter ending June 30, 2022, except that after the reinstatement instead of using the prior four calendar quarters’ results in the calculations, only results for the second quarter of 2022 and thereafter are used during a phase in period.  In addition, for the second quarter of 2022, the only financial covenant that shall be required to be satisfied shall be a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00:1.00 as of the end of such quarter.  For the fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period (i.e., after June 30, 2022), the financial covenant requirements set forth in the credit facility before the Amendments shall apply, except that the maximum leverage ratio requirement will be amended to be (a) 8.50:1:00 as at the end of the first and second fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period, (b) 8.00:1.00 as at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period, (c) 7.50:1:00 as at the end of the fifth fiscal quarter ending after the Covenant Relief\n52\nPeriod and (d) 7.25:1.00 at all times thereafter.\nThe Amendment\ns\npermit us to terminate the Covenant Relief Period at any time, subject to demonstrating satisfaction of the financial maintenance covenants that otherwise would apply for the quarter ending\nJune\n30, 202\n2\n.\nThe Amendments also provide for, among other things:\nIn connection with each Amendment, we paid a consent fee of 7.5 basis points on the amount of each consenting lender’s commitments under the revolver and term facilities.\n53\nAt December 31, 2020, the following table summarizes the results of the financial tests required by the credit facility, for informational purposes only, as the covenants are not currently in effect under the Amendment\ns\n:\nInterest and Fees.\nWe pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin. Outside of the Covenant Relief Period, the margin ranges from 77.5 to 145 basis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating). The Amendments increased the applicable margin during the Covenant Relief Period by 40 basis points. We also pay a facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. Based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2020, we are able to borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points and pay a facility fee of 25 basis points. Outside of the Covenant Relief Period, interest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 85 to 165 basis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating). The Amendments also increased the applicable margin during the Covenant Relief Period by 40 basis points. Based on Host L.P.’s long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2020, our applicable margin on LIBOR loans under both term loans is 165 basis points.\nBorrowings under our revolver (currently $1.5 billion) and the $1 billion outstanding in term loans constitute our primary obligations denominated in LIBOR. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR over time. On November 30, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board expressed support for a plan to cease publication of the one week and two month LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021, and the remaining LIBOR rates after June 30, 2023, and encouraged banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as possible. Accordingly, it is highly likely that the LIBOR rates under our credit facility will be discontinued after June 2023. There currently is no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined.  Our credit facility provides that in the event LIBOR no longer is published, we and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, will amend the credit facility to provide for a comparable successor rate or, in the absence of an amendment, borrowings will be deemed converted to base rate borrowing at the higher of the federal funds rate plus ½ of 1% or the “prime rate” announced by Bank of America, N.A.\nOther Covenants and Events of Default.\nThe credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x. At any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, and outside of the Covenant Waiver Period, acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions generally are permitted except where they would result in a breach of the financial covenants, calculated on a pro forma basis. Additionally, the credit facility’s restrictions on incurrence of debt incorporate the same financial covenant as set forth in our senior notes indenture.\nThe credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders’ commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders’ commitments automatically will terminate.\nMortgage Debt of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.\nWe own non-controlling interests in joint ventures that are not consolidated and that are accounted for under the equity method. The portion of the mortgage and other debt of these joint ventures attributable to us, based on our ownership percentage thereof, was $145 million at December 31, 2020. The debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures is non-recourse to us.\nDistributions/Dividends\n.\nHost Inc.’s policy on common dividends generally is to distribute, over time, at least 100% of its taxable income, which primarily is dependent on our results of operations, as well as on tax gains and losses on hotel sales. After paying its regular quarterly common cash dividend of $0.20 per share for the first quarter of 2020, Host Inc. suspended its regular quarterly common cash dividend in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any future dividend will be subject to approval by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors. In addition, in connection with the amendments to the credit facility, we agreed to substantial limitations on our ability to pay common cash dividends during the Covenant Relief Period as discussed above.\n54\nFunds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends are provided\nby\ndistributions from Host L.P. As of December 31, 20\n20\n, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately\n99%\nof Host L.P.’s common OP units. The remaining common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Each OP unit may be offered for redemption by the\nlimited partners\nfor cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. The current conversion ratio is 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit.\nDuring the Covenant Relief Period, all redemptions must be made with Host Inc. common stock\n.\nInvestors should consider the 1% non-controlling position of Host L.P. OP units when analyzing dividend payments by Host Inc. to its stockholders, as these holders of OP units share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by Host L.P. to holders of its OP units. For example, if Host Inc. paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common OP unit distribution by Host L.P. to Host Inc., as well as to the other common OP unitholders.\nCounterparty Credit Risk.\nWe are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. We assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligations to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility. We believe our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion of the following critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”:\nAll Owned Hotel Operating Statistics and Results\nTo facilitate a year-over-year comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in this annual report on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we temporarily are suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of December 31, 2020, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019 or through the reporting date; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results.\nConstant US$ and Nominal US$\nOperating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. For comparative purposes, we also present the RevPAR results for the prior year assuming the results of our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in the current year, thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the year-over-year comparisons. We believe that this presentation is useful to investors as it provides clarity with respect to the growth in RevPAR in the local currency of the hotel consistent with the manner in which we would evaluate our domestic portfolio. However, the effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the actual results of net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n,\nearnings per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. Nominal US$ results include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.\n55\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. These measures are as follows: (i) EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\nand Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nas a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P., (ii) Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), as a measure of performance for Host Inc., and (iii) all owned hotel pro forma operating results, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nWe calculate EBITDA\nre\nand NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDA\nre\nand FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDA\nre\nand FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDA\nre,\nand Adjusted EBITDA\nre\npurposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration\nand other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDA\nre,\nAdjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\nand Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nshould not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as measures of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.\nSimilarly, EBITDA\nre\n, Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO include adjustments for non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in seven domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 10 hotels and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA\nre\nand Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nare calculated as set forth below. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic consequences of our investments in these entities. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance.\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nEBITDA\nEarnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs.\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nWe present EBITDA\nre\nin accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of our results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDA\nre\nas net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDA\nre\nof unconsolidated affiliates.\n56\nWe make additional adjustments to EBITDA\nre\nwhen evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nalso is similar to what is used in calculating certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDA\nre\nfor the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n:\nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDA\nre\nfor gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last such adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nto net income (loss), the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider the most directly comparable:\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\nand Adjusted EBITDA\nre\nfor Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n(in millions)\n57\nFFO Measures\nWe present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted NAREIT’s definition of FFO included in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement. The adoption did not result in a change in the way we calculate NAREIT FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.\nWe believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.\nWe also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:\nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance.\nFor example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.\n58\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the differences between our non-GAAP financial measures, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO (separately and on a per diluted share basis), and net income\n(loss)\n, the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider most directly comparable:\nHost Inc. Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Common Share to\nNAREIT and Adjusted Funds From Operations per Diluted Share\n(in millions, except per share amount)\n59\nAll\nOwned\nHotel\nPro Forma\nProperty Level Operating Results\nWe present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and EBITDA (and the related margins), on a hotel-level pro forma basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our hotel results reflect the operating results of our hotels as discussed in “All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present all owned hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our hotels after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our hotels. All owned hotel results are presented both by location and for our properties in the aggregate. While severance expense is not uncommon at the individual property level in the normal course of business, we eliminate from our hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.\nBecause of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.\nWhile management believes that presentation of all owned hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on all owned hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons, we believe all owned hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.\n60\nThe following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our\nall owned hotel pro\nforma results\nfor the periods presented herein:\nAll Owned Hotel Pro Forma Results for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n(in millions, except hotel statistics)\n61"

    "text": "All information in this section applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nOur future income, cash flows and fair values with respect to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We have no derivative financial instruments that are held for trading purposes. We use derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks. As of February 19, 2021, we do not have any interest rate derivatives outstanding.\nThe interest payments on 55% of our debt are fixed in nature. Valuations for mortgage debt and the credit facility are determined based on expected future payments, discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The senior notes are valued based on quoted market prices. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by 100 basis points, interest expense would increase or decrease, respectively, our earnings and cash flows by approximately $25 million in 2021. The table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates (in millions, except percentages):\nExchange Rate Sensitivity\nWe have currency exchange risk because of our hotel ownership in Brazil and Canada and our minority investment in a joint venture in India. We may utilize several strategies to mitigate the exposure of currency exchange risk for our portfolio, including (i) utilizing local currency denominated debt (including foreign currency draws on our credit facility), (ii) entering into forward or option foreign currency purchase contracts, or (iii) investing through partnership and joint venture structures. For 2020 and 2019, revenues from our consolidated foreign operations were $20 million and $88 million, respectively, or approximately 1% and 2% of our total revenues, respectively. Over the past few years, we have strategically exited international markets, including the disposition of one hotel in Mexico in 2018 and one hotel in Australia in 2017. Additionally, in 2018, we sold our approximate 33% interest in the European joint venture. As a result, our prospective foreign currency exchange risk will have a minimal impact on our results of operations.\nWe have two foreign currency forward purchase contracts, each with a notional amount of CAD 37 million ($28 million) that mature in March 2021. We also have a foreign currency forward purchase contract with a notional amount of CAD 25 million ($18 million) that matures in February 2021. The foreign currency exchange agreements into which we have entered strictly are to hedge foreign currency risk and are not for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of these contracts was approximately $4 million. These contracts are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to\nother comprehensive income (loss) for contracts designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, and through net income for contracts acting as a natural hedge of intercompany loans. The foreign currency forward sale contracts are valued based on the forward yield curve of the foreign currency to U.S. dollar forward exchange rate on the date of measurement. Pursuant to these contracts, we will sell the foreign currency amount, as applicable, and receive the U.S. dollar amount on the forward sale date. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk when we calculate the fair value of the derivatives.\n62"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019, due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially  challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosure to which it relates.\n64\nEvaluation of hotel property recoverability\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, property and equipment, less accumulated depreciation as of December 31, 2020, was $9,416 million. The Company assesses its property and equipment, primarily comprised of hotel properties, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations, the Company performed recoverability assessments on all of its hotel properties. Recoverability of hotel properties is measured by performing a comparison of the carrying amount of each hotel property to its expected undiscounted future cash flows over its remaining useful life.\nWe identified the evaluation of hotel property recoverability as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required in evaluating the key assumptions used in the recoverability analysis. The key assumptions include the undiscounted future cash flows of each hotel property, and the Company’s intent and ability to hold each hotel property for a period that recovers the carrying value. A significant change to these assumptions could impact the Company’s determination of the recoverability of the carrying value of its hotel properties. Additionally, the audit effort associated with the evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows required specialized skills and knowledge because of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the expected duration and financial impact of the resulting economic downturn.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the impairment process, including controls over the undiscounted future cash flows of the hotel properties, including the expected duration and financial impact of the economic downturn. We also tested certain internal controls related to the Company’s assessment of its intent and ability to hold each hotel property for a period that recovers the carrying value. We assessed the Company’s intent and ability to hold each hotel property for a period that recovers the carrying value by:\nWe also involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in assessing the undiscounted future cash flows of each hotel property by comparing the expected duration and financial impact of the economic downturn to publicly available market data.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nMcLean, Virginia\nFebruary 25, 2021\n65\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nHost Hotels & Resorts, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”), and our report dated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that\nwe plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures\nas\nwe considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nMcLean, Virginia\nFebruary 25, 2021\n66\nReport of Independent Regist\nered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Partners of Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. and Board of Directors of Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. and subsidiaries (the “Partnership”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”).

Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, operates through an umbrella partnership structure, with Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., a Maryland corporation, as its sole general partner. In the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we use the terms “we” or “our” to refer to Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. together, unless the context indicates otherwise. We also use the term “Host Inc.” to refer specifically to Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and the term “Host L.P.” to refer specifically to Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. in cases where it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P. Host Inc. holds approximately\n99\n% of Host L.P.’s partnership interests, or OP units.\nLiquidity and Management’s Plans\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on U.S. and global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets beginning in the first quarter of 2020. The adverse economic impact continues as various restrictive measures remain in place in many jurisdictions where we own hotels, including quarantines, restrictions on travel, school closings, limitations on the size of gatherings and/or restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact almost every industry directly or indirectly, including having a severe impact on the U.S. lodging industry generally and our company specifically.\nAt the start of the pandemic, we suspended operations at\n35\nhotels and, as of December 31, 2020, operations remain suspended at\nfour\nof these hotels. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 on our operations and future bookings have had, and will continue to have, a material negative impact on our financial results and cash flows, and such negative impact may continue well after restrictive measures imposed by federal, state, local and other government authorities to contain the outbreak have been lifted. During 2020, we drew down $\n1.5\nbillion on the revolver portion of our credit facility as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility. We are continuing to take further measures to preserve our liquidity, including operating expense reductions, capital expenditures deferrals, suspension of future dividends and suspension of common stock repurchases. We also have reached agreements with our hotel managers to temporarily suspend furniture, fixture and equipment (“FF&E”) replacement fund contributions for our hotels and to defer certain hotel initiatives and brand standards.\nConsolidated Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2020, the hotels in our consolidated portfolio are in the following countries:\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Host Inc., Host L.P. and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, including joint ventures and partnerships. We consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to control them. For the majority of our hotel and real estate investments, we consider those control rights to be (i) approval or amendment of developments plans, (ii) financing decisions, (iii) approval or amendments of operating budgets, and (iv) investment strategy decisions.\nWe also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they are variable interest entities (“VIEs”). If a subsidiary is a VIE, it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for VIEs. Typically, the entity that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance consolidates the VIE. We consider an entity to be a VIE if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. We review our subsidiaries and affiliates at least annually to determine (i) if they should be considered VIEs, and (ii) whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in the characteristics thereof.\n81\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThree partnerships are considered VIE’s, as the general partner of these partnerships maintains control over the decisions that most significantly impact the partnerships. The first VIE is the operating partnership, Host L.P., which is consolidated by Host Inc., of which Host Inc. is the general partner and holds\n99\n% of the limited partner interests. Host Inc.’s sole significant asset is its investment in Host L.P. and substantially all of Host Inc.’s assets and liabilities represent assets and liabilities of Host L.P. All of Host Inc.’s debt is an obligation of Host L.P. and may be settled only with assets of Host L.P. The consolidated partnership that owns the Houston Airport Marriott at George Bush Intercontinental, of which we are the general partner and hold\n85\n% of the partnership interests, also is a VIE. The total assets of this VIE at December 31, 2020 are $\n59\nmillion and consist primarily of cash, a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and property and equipment. Liabilities for the VIE total $\n28\nmillion and consist of a lease liability, accounts payable and deferred revenue. The unconsolidated partnership that owns the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown, of which we hold\n11\n% of the limited partner interests, also is a VIE. The carrying amount of this investment at December 31, 2020 is $(\n7\n) million and is included in advances to and investments in affiliates. The mortgage debt held by this VIE is non-recourse to us.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nProperty and Equipment\nGenerally, property and equipment is recorded at cost. For hotels that we develop, cost includes interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction. For property and equipment acquired in a business combination, we record the assets acquired based on their fair value as of the acquisition date. Replacements and improvements and finance leases are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nProperties acquired in an asset acquisition are recorded at cost. The acquisition cost is allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, as well as identifiable intangible and lease assets and liabilities. Acquisition cost is allocated using relative fair values. We evaluate several factors, including weighted market data for similar assets, expected future cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates, and replacement costs for assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair values.\nWe capitalize certain inventory (such as china, glass, silver, and linen) at the time of a hotel opening or acquisition, or when significant inventory is purchased (in conjunction with a major rooms renovation or when the number of rooms or meeting space at a hotel is expanded). These amounts then are amortized over the estimated useful life of\nthree years\n. Subsequent replacement purchases are expensed when placed in service.\nWe maintain a furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement fund for renewal and replacement capital expenditures at our hotels, which generally is funded with\n5\n% of property revenues.\nImpairment testing.\nWe analyze our consolidated hotels for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We test for impairment in several situations, including:\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operations, we performed recoverability assessments on all of our hotels. Recoverability of hotels is measured by performing a comparison of the carrying amount of each hotel to its expected undiscounted future cash flows over its remaining useful life. While expected undiscounted future cash flows are subject to uncertainty due to factors including the duration and financial impact of the resulting economic downturn and changes in travel patterns of hotel customers, we assumed a four-year recovery period to 2019 operating levels, based on previous disruptions and recoveries, as well as\n82\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nindustry forecasts. In order to assess the sensitiv\nity\nof the four-year recovery assumption, we performed the recoverability assessment using a six-year recovery period, with no changes to the outcome.\nTo the extent that a\nhotel\nhas a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not that\nit\nwill be sold prior to the end thereof, it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the property’s carrying\namount\n. In the absence of other factors, we assume that the estimated useful life is equal to the remaining GAAP depreciable life because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements\n,\nincluding critical infrastructure, which regularly is maintained and then replaced at the end of its useful life\n. We adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise, such as an expiring ground lease, or that it is more likely than not that the\nhotel\nwill be sold prior to the end of its previously expected useful life.\nDuring 2019, due to a reduction in the estimated hold period of the assets, we recognized impairment expense of $\n14\nmillion related to\none\nhotel and a right of use asset associated with an operating lease. No other properties had triggering events warranting impairment testing. During 2018, we recognized impairment expense of $\n260\nmillion on\nfour\nhotels. See Note 13 - Fair Value Measurements.\nClassification of Assets as Held for Sale.\nWe will classify a hotel as held for sale when its sale is probable, will be completed within one year and actions to complete the sale are unlikely to change or it is unlikely that the sale will not occur. This policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale frequently are not known until purchase agreements are executed, the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist that could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner. We typically classify hotels as held for sale when all the following conditions are met:\nIf these criteria are met, we will cease recording depreciation expense and will record an impairment expense if the fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the hotel. We will classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet. Gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of sale or are deferred and recognized as income in subsequent periods as conditions requiring deferral are satisfied or expire without further cost to us.\nDiscontinued Operations.\nWe generally include the operations of a hotel that was sold or a hotel that has been classified as held for sale in continuing operations, including the gain or loss on the sale, unless the sale represents a strategic shift that will have a major impact on our future operations and financial results.\nAsset retirement obligations.\nWe recognize the fair value of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations, including environmental remediation liabilities, when incurred, which generally is upon acquisition, construction, or development and/or through the normal operation of the asset, if information exists with which to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense.\nWe depreciate our property and equipment using the straight-line method. Depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. The useful lives of the assets are based on several assumptions, including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets, as well as specific market and economic conditions. While management believes its estimates are reasonable, a change in the estimated useful lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels.\nIntangible Assets and Acquired Liabilities\nIn conjunction with our acquisitions, we may identify intangible assets and other liabilities. These identifiable intangible assets and other liabilities typically include above and below-market contracts, including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements, which are recorded at fair value in a business combination and at its relative fair value in an asset acquisition. These contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of terms and conditions for similar contracts measured over the period equal to the\n83\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nremaining non-cancelable term of the contract. Intangible assets and other liabilities are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable term of the related agreements.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nOther Consolidated Partnerships.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we consolidate\ntwo\nmajority-owned partnerships that have third-party, non-controlling ownership interests. The third-party partnership interests are included in non-redeemable non-controlling interests - other consolidated partnerships on the consolidated balance sheets and totaled $\n5\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests of consolidated partnerships is included in our determination of net income. Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests of third parties was $(\n1\n) million, $\n2\nmillion and $\n52\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nHost Inc.’s treatment of the non-controlling interests of Host L.P.\nHost Inc. adjusts the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. each period so that the amount presented equals the greater of its carrying amount based on its historical cost or its redemption value. The historical cost is based on the proportional relationship between the historical cost of equity held by our common stockholders relative to that of the unitholders of Host L.P. The redemption value is based on the amount of cash or Host Inc. common stock, at our option, that would be paid to the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. if it were terminated. We have estimated that the redemption value is equivalent to the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the OP units currently owned by unaffiliated limited partners (\none OP unit may be exchanged for\n1.021494\nshares of Host Inc. common stock) valued at the market price of Host Inc.\ncommon stock at the balance sheet date. Redeemable non-controlling interests of Host L.P. are classified in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet as they do not meet the requirements for equity classification because the redemption feature requires the delivery of registered shares.\nThe table below details the historical cost and redemption values for the non-controlling interests of Host L.P.:\n(1)\nThe book value recorded is equal to the greater of the redemption value or the historical cost.\nNet income (loss) is allocated to the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. based on their weighted average ownership percentage during the period. Net income (loss) attributable to Host Inc. has been reduced by the amount attributable to non-controlling interests in Host L.P., which totaled $(\n8\n) million, $\n10\nmillion, and $\n12\nmillion for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nInvestments in Affiliates\nDistributions from Investments in Affiliates.\nWe classify the distributions from our equity investments in the statements of cash flows based upon an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances of each distribution. For example, distributions of cash that were generated by property operations are classified as cash flows from operating activities. However, distributions of cash that were generated by property sales are classified as cash flows from investing activities.\nIncome Taxes\nHost Inc. elected to be treated as a REIT effective January 1, 1999 pursuant to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. It is our intention to continue to comply with the REIT qualification requirements and to maintain our qualification for treatment as a REIT. A corporation that elects REIT status and meets certain tax law requirements regarding the distribution of its taxable income to its stockholders as prescribed by applicable tax laws and that complies with certain other requirements (relating primarily to the composition of its assets and the sources of its gross income) generally is not subject to federal and state corporate income taxation on its operating income that is distributed to its stockholders. As a partnership for federal income tax purposes, Host L.P. is not subject to federal income tax. Host L.P. is, however, subject to state, local and foreign income and franchise tax in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, each of the Host L.P. taxable REIT subsidiaries is taxable as a regular C corporation, and is subject to federal, state and foreign corporate income tax. Our consolidated income tax provision (benefit) includes the income tax provision\n84\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(benefit)\nrelated to the operations of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, and state, local, and foreign income and franchise taxes incurred by Host L.P. and its subsidiaries.\nDeferred\nTax Assets and Liabilities.\nPursuant to its partnership agreement, Host L.P. generally is required to reimburse Host Inc. for any tax payments it is required to make. Accordingly, the tax information included herein represents disclosures regarding Host Inc. and its subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss and capital loss carryovers. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies.\nGAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return. We must determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than\n50\n% likely of being realized upon settlement to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. This accounting standard applies to all tax positions related to income taxes.  We recognize any accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.\nDeferred Charges\nFinancing costs related to long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method. These costs are presented as a direct deduction from the related long-term debt on the balance sheets.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAs of December 31, 2020, our foreign operations consist of hotels located in Brazil and Canada, as well as an investment in an Asia/Pacific joint venture. The financial statements of these hotels and our investments therein are maintained in their functional currency, which generally is the local currency, and their operations are translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for the period. The assets and liabilities of the hotels and the investments therein are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in other comprehensive income (loss).\nForeign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency for each applicable foreign entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at period end exchange rates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions and derivatives on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, except when recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) as qualifying net investment hedges.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe components of total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the balance sheets are as follows (in millions):\nDuring 2019, we reclassified a net loss due to foreign currency translation of $\n4\nmillion related to foreign subsidiaries that were substantially liquidated. No material amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2020.\nRevenues\nSubstantially all of our operating results represent revenues and expenses generated by property-level operations. Payments are due from customers when services are provided to them. Due to the short-term nature of our contracts and the almost concurrent\n85\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nreceipt of payment, we have no material unearned revenue\ns\nat year end. We collect sales, use, occupancy and similar taxes at our hotels, which we present on a net basis (excluded from revenues) on our statements of operations. Revenues are recognized as follows:\nFair Value\nMeasurement\nIn evaluating the fair value of both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, GAAP outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market assumptions based on market data (“observable inputs”) and a reporting entity’s own assumptions about market data (“unobservable inputs”). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date in an orderly transaction (an “exit price”). Assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:\nLevel 1 — Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 — Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active (markets with few transactions), inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 — Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the pricing of an asset or liability when observable inputs are not available.\n86\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEarnings (Loss) Per Common Share (Unit)\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share (unit) is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (unitholders) by the weighted average number of shares of Host Inc. common stock or Host L.P. common units outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share (unit) is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (unitholders), as adjusted for potentially dilutive securities, by the weighted average number of shares of Host Inc. common stock or Host L.P. common units outstanding plus other potentially dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans or the common OP units distributed to Host Inc. to support such shares granted, and other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partner interests to common OP units. No effect is shown for any securities that are anti-dilutive.\nThe calculation of Host Inc. basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share is shown below (in millions, except per share amounts):\nThe calculation of Host L.P. basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common unit is shown below (in millions, except per unit amounts):\nShare-Based Payments\nUpon the issuance of Host’s common stock under the compensation plans, Host L.P. will issue to Host Inc. common OP units of an equivalent value. These liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n87\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe recognize costs resulting from Host Inc.’s share-based payment transactions over their vesting periods. We classify share-based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services either as equity-classified awards or liability-classified awards. Equity-classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. Liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. The plan includes awards that vest over a\none-year\n,\ntwo-year\nand\nthree-year\nperiod. For performance-based awards, compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable. If a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable, recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome. No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility, however, this cash balance is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.\nAcquisitions and\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen acquiring an asset, we determine whether the acquisition is an asset acquisition or a business combination based on whether the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single (group of similar) identifiable assets, resulting in an asset acquisition or, if not, resulting in a business combination. If treated as an asset acquisition, the asset is recorded in accordance with our property and equipment policy and related acquisition costs are capitalized as part of the asset.\nIn a business combination, we recognize identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests at their fair values at the acquisition date based on the exit price (i.e., the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date). We evaluate several factors, including market data for similar assets, expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets and liabilities acquired. Property and equipment are recorded at fair value and such fair value is allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties. Acquisition-related costs, such as due diligence, legal and accounting fees, are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets.\nOther items that we evaluate include identifiable intangible assets, lease assets and liabilities and, in a business combination, goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets typically consist of assumed contracts, including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements, which are recorded at fair value. Finance lease obligations that are assumed as part of the acquisition of a leasehold interest are measured at fair value and are included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we record the corresponding right-of-use assets. Classification of a lease does not change if it is part of an asset acquisition or a business combination. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we may utilize a number of sources that arise in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data, including third-party appraisals and valuations. In certain situations, and usually only in connection with the acquisition of a foreign hotel, a deferred tax liability is recognized due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the acquired assets at the acquisition date. In a business combination, any consideration paid in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired would be recorded to goodwill. In very limited circumstances, we may record a bargain purchase gain if the consideration paid is less than the net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.\nLeases\nWe consider an arrangement to contain a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for compensation. All leases pursuant to which we are the lessee, including operating leases, are recognized as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the present value of our fixed payment obligations. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of our lease obligations at initiation or modification. Our operating leases may require fixed payments, variable payments based on a percentage of revenue or income, or payments equal to the greater of a fixed or variable payment. Variable payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease terms include renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, and renewal options controlled by the lessor.\n88\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDisaggregation of Revenues\n.\nWhile we do not consider the following disclosure of hotel revenues by location to consist of reportable segments, we have disaggregated hotel revenues by market location. Our revenues also are presented by country in Note 16 – Geographic and Business Segment Information.\nBy Location.\nThe following table presents hotel revenues for each of the geographic locations in our consolidated hotel portfolio (in millions):\nProperty and equipment consists of the following (in millions):\nThe aggregate cost of real estate for federal income tax purposes is approximately $\n9.7\nbillion at December 31, 2020.\n89\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n4.\nInvestments in Affiliates\nWe own investments in joint ventures for which the equity method of accounting is used. The debt of our joint ventures is non-recourse to, and not guaranteed by, us, and a default of such debt does not trigger a default under any of our debt instruments. We carry our investments at historical cost which, due to debt restructurings or distributions, may result in a negative investment balance. However, a negative investment balance does not represent a funding obligation for us or for our partners. Investments in affiliates consist of the following (in millions):\nIn 2020, our Maui timeshare joint venture recorded a $\n21\nmillion impairment expense, of which our share was $\n14\nmillion, on its inventory of timeshare units. This impairment expense is reflected through equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates on our consolidated statements of operations.\n90\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDebt consists of the following (in millions):\n_________\nSenior Notes\nGeneral.\nUnder the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all our unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all our subordinated obligations. The face amount of our senior notes at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $\n3.1\nbillion and $\n2.8\nbillion, respectively. The senior notes balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are net of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs of approximately $\n35\nmillion and $\n24\nmillion, respectively. We pay interest on each series of our senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated in the table above.\nUnder the terms of the senior notes indenture, our ability to incur indebtedness is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we are below the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio covenant requirement of our senior notes indenture necessary to incur additional debt, and therefore, we will not be able to incur additional debt until we are in compliance.\nOn August 20, 2020, we issued $\n600\nmillion of\n3.5\n% Series I senior notes and on September 3, 2020, we completed the issuance of an additional $\n150\nmillion of Series I senior notes, for total proceeds of $\n733\nmillion, net of discounts, underwriting fees and expenses. The Series I senior notes are due in\nSeptember 2030\nand interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15, commencing\nMarch 15, 2021\n. The proceeds of this issuance were used to repurchase via a tender offer of $\n364\nmillion (approximately\n81\n%) of the $\n450\nmillion\n4.75\n% Series C senior notes due 2023 for $\n390\nmillion, including a prepayment premium of $\n26\nmillion. Additionally, the remaining $\n86\nmillion of Series C senior notes were redeemed in December 2020 for $\n94\nmillion, including a premium of approximately $\n8\nmillion. On September 26, 2019, we issued $\n650\nmillion of\n3.375\n% Series H senior notes due\nDecember 2029\nfor proceeds of approximately $\n640\nmillion, net of discounts, underwriting fees and expenses.\nInterest is payable semi-annually\nin arrears on June 15 and December 15, commencing\nDecember 15, 2019\n. The net proceeds were used, together with cash on hand, to redeem our $\n300\nmillion\n6\n% Series Z senior notes due 2021 and our $\n350\nmillion\n5.25\n% Series B senior notes due 2022, including a prepayment premium of $\n50\nmillion.\nAuthorization for Repurchase of Senior Notes.\nIn July 2019, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to $\n1.0\nbillion of senior notes (other than in accordance with their terms). No repurchases occurred in 2020 under this program. Subsequent to year end, in February 2021, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors reauthorized this authority through February 2023.\nCredit Facility.\nOn August 1, 2019, we entered into the fifth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as co-syndication agents, and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $\n1.5\nbillion (which is substantially fully utilized). The revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for Canadian dollars,\n91\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAustralian dollars, Euros, British pounds sterling and, if available to the lenders, Mexican pesos\n,\nof up to the foreign currency equivalent of\n$\n500\nmillion, subject to a lower amount in the case of Mexican peso borrowings. The credit facility also provides for\na\nterm loan facility of $\n1\nbillion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $\n100\nmillion for swingline borrowings in\ncurrencies other than U.S. dollars\nand a subfacility of up to $\n100\nmillion for issuances of letters of credit. Host L.P. also has the option to\nadd in the future\n$\n500\nmillion\nof commitments which may be used for additional revolving credit facility borrowings and/or term loans, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments (which we have not currently obtained) and the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nThe revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity date of\nJanuary 11, 2024\n,\nwhich date may be extended by up to a year by the exercise of up to\ntwo six-month\nextension options\n,\neach of which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee\nand the accuracy of representations and warranties\n.\nOne\n$\n500\nmillion term loan\ntranche has an initial maturity date of\nJanuary 11, 2024\n, which date may be extended up to a year by the exercise of\none 1-year extension\noption, which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee; and the second $500 million term loan tranche has a maturity date of\nJanuary 9, 2025\n, which date may not be extended\n.\nOn June 26, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility, and subsequent to year end, on February 9, 2021, we entered into a second amendment to the credit facility (collectively, the “Amendments”). The Amendments suspend requirements to comply with all existing financial maintenance covenants under the credit facility for the period which began on\nJuly 1, 2020\nand ends on the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022 (such period, the “Covenant Relief Period”), followed by a phase-in period thereafter.\nThe Amendments also provide for, among other things: an increase of\n40\nbasis points in the interest rate applicable to outstanding borrowings during the Covenant Relief Period; the addition of a permanent LIBOR floor of\n15\nbasis points; the addition of a minimum liquidity covenant requiring a minimum liquidity level of $\n400\nmillion at the end of each month through the end of the Covenant Relief Period; certain limitations on acquisitions, distributions, repurchases, redemptions and capital expenditures during the Covenant Relief Period; limitations on debt incurrence to only those permitted under our senior notes indenture during the Covenant Relief Period; and a requirement during the Covenant Relief Period to apply the net cash proceeds in excess of $\n350,000,000\nin the aggregate from asset sales and debt issuances (but not equity issuances) as a mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding under the credit facility, subject to various exceptions.\nIn connection with each Amendment, we paid a consent fee of\n7.5\nbasis points on the amount of each consenting lender’s commitments under the revolver and term facilities.\nThe following is a discussion of the terms of the credit facility agreement, including the terms that are in effect outside of the Covenant Relief Period, except where noted otherwise.\nOutside of the Covenant Relief Period, we pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin\nranging from\n77.5\nto\n145\nbasis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating). The Amendments increased the applicable margin during the Covenant Relief Period by\n40\nbasis points. We also pay a facility fee ranging from\n12.5\nto\n30\nbasis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. Based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2020, we are able to borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus\n150\nbasis points for an all-in rate of\n1.65\n% and pay a facility fee of\n25\nbasis points.\nOutside of the Covenant Relief Period, interest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from\n85\nto\n165\nbasis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating). The Amendments also increased the applicable margin during the Covenant Relief Period by\n40\nbasis points. Based on Host L.P.’s long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2020, our applicable margin on LIBOR loans under both term loans is\n165\nbasis points, for an all-in rate of\n1.8\n%.\nNet draws under the credit facility were $\n1,483\nmillion in 2020 and net repayments were $\n56\nmillion in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we have $\n12\nmillion of available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Due to the senior notes covenant noted above, however, we currently are restricted from incurring additional debt.\nFinancial Covenants\n. The credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage (as defined in our credit facility). We are permitted to borrow and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA (“leverage ratio”) is not in excess of\n7.25\nx, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than\n1.75\nx and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than\n1.25\nx. Except as set forth during the Covenant Relief Period and phase-in period thereafter, these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as gains and losses on the\n92\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nextinguishment of debt, deferred financing costs related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan in order to establish the debt at fair value and non-cash interest expense, all of which are or have been included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations.\nAdditionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a “net debt” concept, under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $\n100\nmillion are deducted from our total debt balance.\nUnder the terms of the Amendment, these covenant requirements currently\nare\nnot in effect\n.\nGuarantees\n.\nThe credit facility requires all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guarantee Host L.P. debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility. Currently, there are no such guarantees.\nOther Covenants and Events of Default\n.\nThe credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below\n6.0\nx. At any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, and outside of the Covenant Waiver Period, acquisitions, investments and dividends generally are permitted except where they would result in a breach of the financial covenants, calculated on a pro forma basis. Additionally, the credit facility’s restrictions on the incurrence of debt\nincorporate the same financial covenant as set forth in our senior notes indenture. Our senior notes and credit facility have cross default provisions that would trigger a default under those agreements if we were to have a payment default or an acceleration prior to maturity of other debt of Host L.P. or its subsidiaries. The amount of other debt in default needs to exceed certain thresholds in order to trigger a cross default and the thresholds are greater for secured debt than for unsecured debt. The credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated, and the lenders’ commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts owed under the credit facility will become due and payable and the lenders’ commitments will terminate.\nAggregate Debt Maturities\nAggregate debt maturities are as follows (in millions):\nInterest\nThe following is a reconciliation between interest expense and cash interest paid (in millions):\n93\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEquity of Host Inc.\nHost Inc. has authorized\n1,050\nmillion shares of common stock, with a par value of\n$\n0.01\nper share, of which\n705.4\nmillion and\n713.4\nmillion were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFifty\nmillion shares of\nno\npar value preferred stock are authorized;\nnone\nof such preferred shares was outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCapital of Host L.P.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately\n99\n% of Host L.P.’s common OP units. The remaining\n1\n% of Host L.P.’s common OP units are held by various unaffiliated limited partners. Each common OP unit may be redeemed for cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock, based on the conversion ratio of\n1.021494\nshares of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit.\nDuring the Covenant Relief Period, all redemptions must be made with Host Inc. common stock. In connection with the issuance of shares by Host Inc., Host L.P. will issue OP units based on the same conversion ratio. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Host L.P. had\n697.7\nmillion and\n705.8\nmillion OP units outstanding, respectively, of which Host Inc. held\n690.5\nmillion and\n698.3\nmillion, respectively.\nRepurchases and Issuances of Common Stock and Common OP Units\nIn February 2017, the Host Inc. Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $\n500\nmillion of common stock. On August 5, 2019, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized an increase in its share repurchase program from $\n500\nmillion to $\n1\nbillion. During 2020, we repurchased\n8.9\nmillion shares at an average price of $\n16.49\nper share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $\n147\nmillion. In 2019, we repurchased\n27.8\nmillion shares at an average price of $\n17.37\nper share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $\n482\nmillion. As of December 31, 2020, we have $\n371\nmillion available for repurchase under the program. Under the terms of the Amendment of our credit facility, we currently are restricted from repurchasing stock or OP units.\nDividends/Distributions\nHost Inc. is required to distribute at least\n90\n% of its annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its stockholders in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT. Funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends on its common stock are provided by distributions from Host L.P.\nThe amount of any future dividends will be determined by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors.\nThe dividends that were taxable to our stockholders in 2020 were considered\n5.9\n% qualified REIT dividends,\n3.6\n% qualified dividend income,\n46.6\n% unrecaptured Section 1250 gain, and\n43.9\n% long term capital gain.\nThe dividends that were taxable to our stockholders in 2019 were considered\n63.4\n% qualified REIT dividends,\n33.7\n% qualified dividend income,\n2.5\n% unrecaptured Section 1250 gain, and\n0.4\n% long term capital gain. The 2020 and 2019 qualified REIT dividends are eligible for the\n20\n% deduction provided by Section 199A.\nThe table below presents the amount of common dividends declared per share and common distributions per unit as follows:\nAs part of our response to COVID-19 and in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility, we suspended our regular quarterly common cash dividends, commencing with the second quarter 2020 dividend that would have been paid in July 2020. Additionally,\nbased on the terms of the credit facility amendments, we are restricted to paying a quarterly common cash dividend of $0.01 per share or higher amounts to the extent necessary to allow Host Inc. to maintain REIT status or to avoid corporate income or excise taxes, until after the covenant waiver period expires following the second quarter of 2022\n.\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year beginning January 1, 1999. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least\n90\n% of our annual taxable income to our stockholders, excluding net capital gain. As a REIT, generally we will not be subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes on that portion of our annual taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be\n94\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nsubject to\nU.S.\nfederal and state corporate income taxes at regular corporate\nincome\ntax\nrates\nand\nmay not be able to qualify as a REIT for\nfour subsequent taxable years\n. Even if we qualify\nto be treated\nas a REIT, we may be subject to certain state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property, and to\nU.S.\nfederal and state\ncorporate\nincome and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income.

Any net operating loss not carried back pursuant to these rules may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limit on the use thereof of\n80\n% of annual taxable income. We recently filed refund claims to recover approximately $\n57\nmillion of U.S. federal income taxes that we paid in\n2017\nthrough\n2019\n, which is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nSet forth below is a table that documents our domestic and foreign tax attributes at December 31, 2020:\nWe have recorded a 100% valuation allowance of approximately $\n9\nmillion against the deferred tax asset related to our domestic capital loss carryover and a 100% valuation allowance of approximately $\n5\nmillion against the deferred tax asset related to certain of our foreign net operating loss and capital loss carryovers as of December 31, 2020. We also have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $\n5\nmillion against the deferred tax asset related to our accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) foreign exchange net losses. The net increase of our valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2020 is approximately $\n6\nmillion from the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe primary components of our net deferred tax assets are as follows (in millions):\nWe believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income in order to realize our total deferred tax assets, net of a valuation allowance of $\n19\nmillion, of $\n185\nmillion.\n95\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOur U.S. and foreign income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes were as follows (in millions):\nThe income tax provision (benefit) for continuing operations consists of (in millions):\nThe differences between the income tax provision (benefit) calculated at the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of\n21\n% and the actual income tax provision (benefit) recorded for continuing operations are as follows (in millions):\nCash paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, was immaterial in 2020,\nand\n$\n93\nmillion and $\n82\nmillion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of our unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\nAll of such uncertain tax position amounts, if recognized, would impact our reconciliation between the income tax provision (benefit) calculated at the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of\n21\n% and the actual income tax provision (benefit) recorded each year.\nWe expect a decrease to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of the reporting date of approximately $\n4\nmillion. As of December 31, 2020, the tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions generally include\n2017\n-\n2020\n. There were\nno\nmaterial interest or penalties recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\n96\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTaxable REIT Subsidiaries Leases\nWe lease substantially all our hotels to a wholly owned subsidiary that qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary due to the U.S. federal income tax prohibition on the ability of a REIT to derive revenues directly from the operations of a hotel.\nGround Leases\nAs of December 31, 2020, all or a portion of\n22\nof our hotels are subject to ground leases, generally with multiple renewal options, all of which are accounted for as operating leases. Payments for ground leases account for approximately\n73\n% of our 2020 minimum lease payments and\n96\n% of our total future minimum lease payments. For lease agreements with scheduled rent increases, we recognize the fixed portion of the lease expense ratably over the term of the lease. As the exercise of the renewal options were determined to be reasonably certain, the payments associated with the renewals have been included in the measurement of the lease liability and ROU asset. Contingent rental payments based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and ROU asset but will be recognized as variable lease expense if and when they are incurred. However, certain of these leases contain provisions that increase the minimum lease payments based on an average of the variable lease payments made over the previous years, for which we will reevaluate the lease liability and ROU asset as these payments represent an increase in the minimum payments for the remainder of the lease term. Certain of these leases also contain provisions that increase the minimum lease payments based on an index such as the Consumer Price Index. Such increases are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and ROU asset but will be recognized as variable lease expense if and when they are incurred. The discount rate used to calculate the lease liability and ROU asset is based on our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), as the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable. To calculate our IBR, we obtained a forward curve using LIBOR swap rates, with terms ranging from one to\nfifty years\n, as well as corresponding bond spreads based on the terms of the leases and our credit risk. The resulting discount rates for our ground leases range from\n4.3\n% to\n5.7\n%.\nOffices Leases and Other\nWe have office leases for our headquarters office in Bethesda, which expires in\n2036\n, as well as satellite offices in Miami and San Diego, which leases expire in\n2022\nand\n2021\n, respectively, with no renewal options.\nWe also have leases on facilities used in our former restaurant business, all of which we subsequently subleased. These\nleases and subleases contain\none\nor more renewal options\n, generally for\nfive- or ten-year\nperiods. The restaurant leases are accounted for as operating leases. Our contingent liability related to these leases is $\n3\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We, however, consider the likelihood of any material funding related to these leases to be remote. Our leasing activity also includes leases entered into by our hotels for various types of equipment, which may be accounted for either as operating or capital leases, depending upon the characteristics of the particular lease arrangement. Our finance leases total less than $\n1\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02,\nLeases (Topic 842)\n, as amended, using the effective date transition method. As a result, disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates or periods prior to January 1, 2019. For the comparative periods, we will provide disclosures required by ASC 840,\nLeases\n.\nThe following table presents lease cost and other information (in millions):\n97\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRent expense in accordance with ASC 840, under which we report prior to January 1, 2019, consists of (in millions):\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the total amount of lease payments, on an undiscounted basis, to the lease liability on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\nMinimum payments for the operating leases have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants of approximately $\n4\nmillion that are payable to us under non-cancelable subleases.\nUpon the issuance of Host Inc.’s common stock for stock-based compensation, Host L.P. issues to Host Inc. common OP units of an equivalent value. Accordingly, these awards and related disclosures are included in both Host Inc.’s and Host L.P.’s consolidated financial statements.\nHost Inc. maintains two stock-based compensation plans, the Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2020 Comprehensive Plan”), under which Host Inc. may award to participating employees restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. At December 31, 2020, there were approximately\n15\nmillion shares of Host Inc.’s common stock reserved and available for issuance under the 2020 Comprehensive Plan.\nWe recognize costs resulting from share-based payments in our financial statements over their vesting periods. No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services. We classify share-based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity-classified or liability-classified awards. Equity-classified awards are measured based on their fair value as of the date of grant. In contrast, liability-classified awards are re-measured to fair value each reporting period.\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $\n17\nmillion, $\n15\nmillion and $\n14\nmillion, respectively. Shares granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 totaled\n2.2\nmillion,\n1.4\nmillion and\n1.2\nmillion, respectively, while\n1.2\nmillion,\n0.9\nmillion and\n0.8\nmillion shares, respectively, vested during those years.\n98\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSenior Executive Plan\nDuring 2020, Host Inc. granted\n2.0\nmillion RSU awards under the 2020 Comprehensive Plan, which amount represents the maximum number of RSUs that can be earned during the period of 2020 through 2022 if performance is at the “high” level of achievement and, for time based awards, the executive remains employed. The RSUs vest over a one, two or\nthree-year\nperiod and\n1.5\nmillion RSUs were unvested at December 31, 2020. Total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSU awards that vest through 2022 is approximately $\n11\nmillion.\nRSU awards\nVesting of RSUs awarded in 2020 is based on (1) continued employment on the vesting date (“Time-Based Award”); (2) the achievement of relative total shareholder return (“TSR”); and (3) our performance against certain annual strategic objectives. Approximately\n40\n% of the RSUs are Time-Based Awards and vest on an annual basis over\nthree years\n; approximately\n30\n% of the RSUs are based on the satisfaction of the TSR compared to the NAREIT Equity Lodging & Resort index that serves as a relevant industry/asset specific measurement to our competitors and vest following a\nthree year\nperformance period; and the remaining\n30\n% are based on our performance against certain strategic objectives and vest on an annual basis. The RSUs granted are considered equity-classified awards. As a result, the fair value of these awards is based on the fair value on the grant date, and such grant date fair value is not adjusted for subsequent movements thereof.\nWe value the time based awards using the closing stock price on the grant date multiplied by the percentage of shares expected to be released, which is\n100\n% of the time based awards. We also value the strategic objective awards using the closing stock price on the grant date multiplied by the percentage of shares expected to be released; however, as a result of the strategic objective awards’ performance conditions, we reevaluate the percentage based on the probability of meeting the performance conditions each period.\nWe value the TSR awards using the economic theory\nthat is the basis for all valuation models, including Binominal, Black-Scholes, exotic options formulas, and Monte Carlo valuations, with the following assumptions:\nIn making these assumptions, we base the expected volatility on the historical volatility over three years using daily stock price observations. The beta is calculated by comparing the risk of our stock to the risk of the applicable peer group index, using three years of daily price data. We base the risk-free rate on the Treasury bond yields corresponding to the length of each performance period as reported by the Federal Reserve.\nThe payout schedule for the TSR awards is as follows, with linear interpolation for points between the 30\nth\nand 75\nth\npercentiles.\n99\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded compensation expense of approximately $\n15\nmillion, $\n13\nmillion and $\n12\nmillion, respectively, related to the RSU awards to senior executives.\nThe following table is a summary of the status of our senior executive plans for the three years ended December 31, 2020:\nOther Stock Plans\nIn addition to the share-based plans described above, we maintain an upper-middle management plan and an employee stock purchase plan. The upper-middle management awards are time-based, equity-classified awards that vest within\nthree years\nof the grant date and compensation expense is recognized over the life of the award based on the grant date fair value. Through the employee stock purchase plan, employees can purchase stock at a discount of\n10\n% of the lower of the beginning and ending stock price each quarter. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we granted a total of\n0.2\nmillion shares,\n0.1\nmillion shares and\n0.1\nmillion shares, respectively, under these two programs and recorded compensation expense of approximately $\n2\nmillion in each year.\nWe contribute to defined contribution plans for the benefit of employees who meet certain eligibility requirements and who elect participation in the plans. The discretionary amount to be matched by us is determined annually by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors. Our liability recorded for this obligation is not material. Payments for these items were not material for the three years ended December 31, 2020.\nWe disposed of\none\nhotel in 2020,\n14\nhotels in 2019 and\nfour\nhotels in 2018 and recorded gains on sales of approximately $\n148\nmillion, $\n339\nmillion and $\n279\nmillion, respectively.\nIn 2020, we sold excess land adjacent to The Phoenician for $\n83\nmillion, and recorded a gain on sale of approximately $\n59\nmillion.\nAdditionally, on September 21, 2018, we sold the New York Marriott Marquis retail and theater commercial units and the related signage areas of the hotel (the “Retail”) to Vornado Realty Trust for a sale price of $\n442\nmillion and recorded a gain of approximately $\n386\nmillion, which amount is net of the non-cash incurrence of a liability of approximately $\n35\nmillion related to Vornado’s contractual right to future real estate tax rebates. Substantially all of the net proceeds from the sale of the Retail were used to close out a reverse like-kind exchange structure established in connection with the acquisition of the Hyatt portfolio in March 2018. We elected to pay U.S. federal and applicable state corporate income tax of approximately $\n16\nmillion on the capital gain generated by the sale proceeds not used to close out the reverse like-kind exchange rather than to distribute such capital gain to our stockholders.\nThe gain on sale of assets is included in other gains/(losses) on the consolidated statement of operations.\n100\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAsset Acquisitions\nIn February 2019, we acquired the fee simple interest in the\n429\n-room 1 Hotel South Beach for a total purchase price of $\n610\nmillion. Consideration included the issuance of $\n23\nmillion of preferred Host L.P. OP units that were included in debt as of December 31, 2019, and $\n3\nmillion of common Host L.P. OP units, all of which were subsequently redeemed in 2020.\n13.\nFair Value Measurements\nImpairment\nDuring 2019, we recorded an impairment expense of $\n14\nmillion related to the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina and a right-of-use asset associated with an operating lease, based on the expected sale proceeds and expected sub-rental income, respectively, which are considered observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2) in the GAAP fair value hierarchy.\nThe Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina was sold in 2019.\nDuring 2018, we recorded an impairment expense of $\n44\nmillion related to the W New York, the W New York – Union Square and the Westin New York Grand Central based on the expected sale proceeds of the properties, which are considered observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2) in the GAAP fair value hierarchy. The W New York and W New York – Union Square hotels were sold during 2018 and the Westin New York Grand Central was classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2018. The fair value of the Westin New York Grand Central, less costs to sell, at December 31, 2018 was $\n270\nmillion. The Westin New York Grand Central was sold in 2019.\nDuring 2018, we also recorded an impairment expense of $\n216\nmillion related to the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel based on a range of sale prices negotiated with a potential buyer, which are considered observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2) in the GAAP fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel following the impairment expense was $\n495\nmillion.\nImpairment expense for 2019 and 2018 is recorded in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of operations.\nOther Liabilities\nFair Value of Other Financial Liabilities.\nWe did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our other financial liabilities. The fair values of secured debt and our credit facility are determined based on the expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates. Senior notes are valued based on quoted market prices. The fair values of financial instruments not included in this table are estimated to be equal to their carrying amounts.\nThe fair value of certain financial liabilities is shown below (in millions):\nWe have entered into various agreements with Marriott, including those for the management or franchise of approximately\n70\n% of our hotels (as measured by revenues) and certain limited administrative services.\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018, we paid Marriott $\n28\nmillion, $\n186\nmillion and $\n200\nmillion, respectively, of hotel management fees and approximately $\n3.0\nmillion, $\n11.5\nmillion and $\n11.7\nmillion, respectively, of franchise fees.\nAll of our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements, with some of our hotels also being subject to separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operations under the designated brand. Hotels managed\n101\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nor franchised by Marriott and Hyatt represent\n70\n% and\n17\n% of our total revenues, respectively. Under these agreements, the managers generally have sole responsibility for all activities necessary for the day-to-day operation of the hotels, including establishing room rates, processing reservations and promoting and publicizing the hotels. The managers also provide all employees for the hotels, prepare reports, budgets and projections, control the working capital, and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels.\nCosts and expenses incurred by the managers are reimbursed by us.\nWe have approval rights over budgets, capital expenditures, significant leases and contractual commitments, and various other matters.\nThe initial term of our agreements generally is\n10\nto\n25\nyears\n, with\none\nor more renewal terms at the option of the manager. The majority of our agreements condition the manager’s right to exercise options for renewal upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria. The manager typically receives a base management fee, which is calculated as a percentage (generally\n2\n-\n3\n%) of annual gross revenues, and an incentive management fee, which typically is calculated as a percentage (generally\n10\n-\n20\n%) of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment. In the case of our hotels operating under the W\n®\n, Westin\n®\n, Sheraton\n®\n, Luxury Collection\n®\nand St. Regis\n®\nbrands, the base management fee is\n1\n% of annual gross revenues, but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to Marriott under a separate license agreement pertaining to the designated brand, including rights to use trademarks, service marks and logos, matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies, and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services. Under the license agreement, Marriott generally receives\n5\n% of gross revenues attributable to room sales and\n2\n% of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales in addition to the base management fee.\nPursuant to the agreements, the manager furnishes the hotels with certain chain services, which generally are provided on a central or regional basis to all hotels in the manager’s hotel system. Chain services include central training, advertising and promotion, national reservation systems, computerized payroll and accounting services, and such additional services as needed which may be more efficiently performed on a centralized basis. Costs and expenses incurred in providing such services are allocated among the hotels managed, owned or leased by the manager on a fair and equitable basis. In addition, our managers generally sponsor a guest rewards program, the costs of which are charged to all of the hotels that participate in such program.\nWe are obligated to provide the manager with sufficient funds, generally\n4\n-\n5\n% of the revenues generated at the hotel, to cover the cost of (a) certain non-routine repairs and maintenance to the hotels which normally are capitalized, and (b) replacements and renewals to the hotels’ furniture, fixtures and equipment. Under certain circumstances, we will be required to establish escrow accounts for such purposes under terms outlined in the agreements. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our managers temporarily suspended these contribution requirements in 2020.\nWe generally are limited in our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee assumes the related management agreement. However, most agreements include owner rights to terminate on the basis of the manager’s failure to meet certain performance-based metrics. Typically, these criteria are subject to the manager’s ability to ‘cure’ and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts (or, in some instances, waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees).\nIn addition to any performance-based or other termination rights, we have negotiated with Marriott and some of our other managers specific termination rights related to specific agreements. These termination rights can take a number of different forms, including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement; termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation; and termination without sale or other condition, which may require the payment of a fee. These termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period; impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by EBITDA; require that a certain number of hotels continue to maintain the brand affiliation; or be restricted to a specific pool of assets.\n102\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe consider each one of our hotels to be an operating segment, as we allocate resources and assess operating performance based on individual hotels. All of our hotels meet the aggregation criteria for segment reporting and our other real estate investment activities (primarily our retail spaces and office buildings) are immaterial. As such, we report\none\nsegment: hotel ownership. Our foreign operations consist of hotels in\ntwo\ncountries as of December 31, 2020. There were no intersegment sales during the periods presented.\nThe following table presents revenues and long-lived assets for each of the geographical areas in which we operate (in millions):\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business regarding the operation of our hotels and company matters. To the extent not covered by insurance, these lawsuits generally fall into the following broad categories: disputes involving hotel-level contracts, employment litigation, compliance with laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, tax disputes and other general matters. Under our management agreements, our operators have broad latitude to resolve individual hotel-level claims for amounts generally less than $\n150,000\n. However, for matters exceeding such threshold, our operators may not settle claims without our consent.\nBased on our analysis of legal proceedings with which we currently are involved or of which we are aware and our experience in resolving similar claims in the past, we have recorded immaterial accruals as of December 31, 2020 related to such claims. We have estimated that, in the aggregate, our losses related to these proceedings will not be material. We are not aware of any other matters with a reasonably possible unfavorable outcome for which disclosure of a loss contingency is required. No assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings.\nGuarantees and Contingencies\nWe have entered into certain guarantees which consist of commitments made to third parties for leases or debt that are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to various dispositions, spin-offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances, including the default by an unrelated party. We also may have contingent environmental liabilities related to the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. We consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees and contingencies to be remote.\nTax Indemnification Agreements\nBecause of certain federal and state income tax considerations of the former owners of two hotels currently owned by Host L.P., we have agreed to restrictions on selling such hotels, or repaying or refinancing mortgage debt, for varying periods. One of these agreements expires in 2028 and the other in 2031.\n103"
