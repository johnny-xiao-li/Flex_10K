    "text": "Part I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nAs a global airline based in the U.S., we connect customers across our expansive global network. In 2019, we served approximately 200 million customers and were the world’s largest airline by total revenues and the most profitable with five consecutive years of $5 billion or more in pre-tax income from 2015 through 2019. In 2020, we made significant adjustments to our network and operations as a result of the unprecedented and widespread impact of COVID-19 and the related travel restrictions and social distancing measures that significantly reduced demand for air travel.\nAfter initially impacting our service to China beginning in January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 and the resulting global pandemic have significantly affected our entire network. Beginning in March 2020, large public events were cancelled, governmental authorities began imposing restrictions on non-essential activities, businesses suspended travel and popular leisure destinations temporarily closed to visitors. In the United States, which is our primary market, the federal government has discouraged travel and encouraged social distancing efforts and limits on gathering size. Numerous travel advisories and restrictions have been implemented, some of which remain in place, between the United States and specific countries. Many foreign governments have also placed restrictions or quarantines on citizens of other countries, including citizens of the U.S., flying into their countries. For instance, the U.S. and numerous other countries are now requiring airline passengers to provide negative COVID-19 test results prior to travel into their countries. State and local governments have also issued travel restrictions, quarantines and advisories and health-related curfews or “shelter in place” orders which dissuade or restrict air travel. As a result, demand for travel declined at a rapid pace in the March 2020 quarter and has remained depressed, which has had an unprecedented and materially adverse impact on our revenues, results of operations and financial position. In 2020, we served approximately 70 million customers, many of them prior to the pandemic’s onset.\nMore information about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe remain committed to industry-leading safety and reliability and are consistently among the industry’s best performers. Our people are our strongest competitive advantage. Our employees provide world-class travel experiences for our customers and give back to the communities where they live, work and serve. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have intensified our focus on ensuring the safety and health of our customers, including through the creation of our Global Cleanliness organization and implementation of the Delta Care Standard to ensure a consistently safe and sanitized experience across our facilities and aircraft. We believe these actions have been an important driver behind the significant increases in our domestic net promoter scores during 2020. Other key competitive advantages include our operational reliability, our global network and customer loyalty.\nIn recent years, we have diversified revenue streams beyond the basic sale of an airline ticket in an effort to reduce the impact of cyclicality and other significant reductions in air travel demand on our results. Our partnership with American Express continued to provide a co-brand revenue stream tied to broader consumer spending during 2020. Our recent focus on premium products and customer segmentation enhanced our revenue growth prior to the pandemic and reduced reliance on the most price sensitive customer segment, a differentiator that we believe has benefited us during the pandemic. We also maintain complementary portfolio businesses, such as our cargo business and our Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (“MRO”) operation, where we believe we remain well positioned for organic growth through contractual agreements with jet engine manufacturers.\nOur internet address is www.delta.com. Information contained on our website is not part of, and is not incorporated by reference in, this Form 10-K.\nThe Delta Brand\nIn 2020, we continued to have the world’s most valuable airline brand. Over the last decade, we significantly improved the quality and reliability of our operations, and our customer satisfaction scores increased significantly as a result. With operational excellence, best-in-class service and a commitment to ensuring the health and safety of our customers, we have continued to earn our customers' trust and preference by delivering the \"Delta Difference.\" We believe our continued investment in customer service and experience, operations, product, airports and technology has shaped customer perception of our brand and driven increased customer loyalty.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               2\nItem 1. Business\nOur Global Network and Fleet\nIn 2019, we offered more than 5,000 daily departures and as many as 15,000 affiliated departures including the premier SkyTeam alliance, of which Delta is a founding member. We generated over 70% of our 2019 passenger revenue from our domestic network, centered around high-margin core hubs in Atlanta, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Detroit and Salt Lake City. These core hub positions complement traditionally strong coastal hub positions in Boston, Los Angeles, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK and Seattle. We have agreements with domestic regional carriers that operate as Delta Connection\n®\nto feed traffic to our domestic hubs. As a result of decreased demand for air travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we significantly reduced our system-wide flight operations, including operations at all of the hubs listed above, beginning in March 2020. We expect to continue to evaluate and adjust our operations to address evolving conditions.\nAlthough our international operations have been substantially curtailed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to serve Transatlantic, Transpacific and Latin America markets directly on Delta and through joint ventures with global airline partners. Internationally, we have significant hubs and market presence in Amsterdam, London-Heathrow, Mexico City, Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Seoul-Incheon.\nThrough innovative alliances with Aeroméxico, Air France-KLM, China Eastern, Korean Air and Virgin Atlantic, and an alliance pending regulatory approval with LATAM Airlines, we seek to bring more choice to customers worldwide. Our strategic relationships with these international airlines are an important part of our business as they improve our access to markets around the world and enable us to provide customers a more seamless global travel experience across our alliance network. In 2019, we and our alliance partners collectively served over 140 countries and more than 900 destinations around the world. The most significant of these arrangements are commercial joint ventures that include joint sales and marketing coordination, co-location of airport facilities and other commercial cooperation arrangements. In some cases, we have reinforced strategic alliances through equity investments where we have opportunity to create deep relationships and maximize commercial cooperation. For additional information about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our investments in these airlines, see \"Commercial Arrangements with Other Airlines\" below and Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAt December 31, 2020, our network included a fleet of more than 1,100\naircraft that are varied in size and capabilities, giving us flexibility to adjust aircraft to the network. Prior to the pandemic, we began refreshing our fleet, acquiring new, more fuel efficient aircraft with increased premium seating, to replace older aircraft and had begun to reduce our fleet complexity with fewer fleet types. We accelerated this fleet simplification strategy by retiring 227 aircraft in 2020, with plans to retire an additional 128\naircraft by 2025.\nExpanded Products and Services\nOver the last decade we have fundamentally transformed our business by investing in our people, our product and our reliability to alter the commodity-like nature of air travel. We have a retail oriented, merchandised approach to distribution with well-defined and differentiated products for our customers. Through improved product segmentation, we offer distinct travel experiences with clear value propositions that enable customer choice and include exceptional service onboard our aircraft. In both 2020 and 2019, approximately one-third of our passenger revenue was from premium products, which include Delta One\n®\n, Delta Premium Select, First Class and Delta Comfort+\n®\n. Main Cabin products, including Basic Economy, represented approximately half of our passenger revenue in 2020 and 2019. During 2020, we increased the flexibility with respect to these products by extending expiration on certain tickets and travel credits, eliminating change fees for domestic tickets and international tickets originating from North America, with the exception of Basic Economy tickets, and waiving change fees for all tickets (including Basic Economy) purchased before March 30, 2021. We derive the remainder of our passenger revenue from loyalty travel awards and travel-related services.\nOur tickets are sold through various distribution channels, with 59% of tickets sold through direct channels in 2020. These include digital channels, such as delta.com and the Fly Delta app, and our reservations specialists where we deliver more direct, personalized interactions with our customers at reduced distribution costs. Indirect distribution channels include online travel agencies and traditional \"brick and mortar\" agencies. We make fare and product information widely available across those channels in an effort to ensure customers receive the best information and service options.\nWe continue to implement merchandising initiatives across our distribution channels to allow customers to better understand our product offerings, make it easier to buy the products they desire and increase customer satisfaction. This merchandising effort is most effective in Delta's digital channels where customers can compare all product options in a single, easy to understand display.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               3\nItem 1. Business\nInnovative Technology to Improve Service and Efficiency\nOur objective is to make technology a strategic differentiator. We continue to invest in technological improvements that support our operations and provide tools for our employees. These investments include improvements to infrastructure and technology architecture to unify and improve access to data sources and continuing innovations to customer facing applications. We believe this digital transformation is enhancing interactions with our customers and allows our people to deliver more personalized service, further enhancing the customer experience and strengthening our brand.\nThrough the development of innovative new technologies, we can better serve customers and give our employees the best tools. For our customers, we are making investments in the Fly Delta app, in the airport and onboard our aircraft. We are evolving the Fly Delta app into a digital travel concierge for our customers to offer convenient services on the day of travel and deliver thoughtful notifications to make their travel journeys more seamless. In the airport, we are investing to create a smoother, less stressful and increasingly contactless travel experience. Onboard the aircraft, we continue to invest in in-flight entertainment with free messaging, and approximately 95% of our mainline aircraft were equipped with seat-back screens as of December 31, 2020. For our employees, we are investing in applications that allow our people to have more meaningful interactions with our customers, as well as tools to make our employees safer and better able to do their jobs.\nCustomer Loyalty Program\nThe SkyMiles program is designed to attract lifetime members and grow customer loyalty by offering incentives to increase travel with us. Our award-winning program offers a wide variety of benefits including award travel and access to complimentary elite benefits and services when traveling with us and our partners. As our brand has strengthened, the SkyMiles program has seen an acceleration in membership growth. We believe there is opportunity to continue this trend as we seek to elevate our customer engagement through opportunities to earn and redeem mileage credits (“miles”) as well as co-brand card offerings coupled with a strong customer experience. The SkyMiles program has a large, growing and premium membership base. This membership base has historically resulted in higher premium revenues and more resilient cash flows for us. SkyMiles has been widely recognized as a top loyalty program by external reviewers such as U.S. News and World Report and The Points Guy.\nThe SkyMiles program provides its members the ability to earn miles when traveling on Delta, Delta Connection and our partner airlines. Miles may also be earned by using certain services offered by program partners, such as credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies and ridesharing companies. To facilitate transactions with participating companies, we sell miles to non-airline businesses, customers and other airlines. In addition, individuals may purchase miles. They can use these miles for award redemptions such as flights and upgrades on Delta, our regional carriers and other participating airlines as well as donations with specific charities and more. In 2020 and 2019, nearly 10% of revenue miles flown on Delta were from award travel, as program members redeemed miles in the loyalty program for approximately 14 million and 20 million award tickets, respectively.\nOur most significant and valuable contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. In 2019, we amended our primary co-brand agreement and other related agreements with American Express. The new agreements increase the total benefit we receive and extend the duration of the relationship to 2029.\nCommercial Arrangements with Other Airlines\nWe have marketing alliances with other airlines to enhance our access to domestic and international markets.\nJoint Venture Agreements.\nWe have implemented three separate joint venture arrangements with foreign carriers, each of which has been granted antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"). We have sought to reinforce a number of the agreements through equity investments in those carriers. As described in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, although we continue to hold the equity investments referenced below, we reduced the carrying value of our investments in Virgin Atlantic, Grupo Aeroméxico and LATAM to zero during 2020.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               4\nItem 1. Business\nEach of our joint venture arrangements provides for joint commercial cooperation with the relevant partner within the geographic scope of the arrangement, including the sharing of revenues and/or profits and losses generated by the parties on the joint venture routes, as well as joint marketing and sales, coordinated pricing and revenue management, network and schedule planning and other coordinated activities with respect to the parties' operations on joint venture routes. Our implemented commercial joint ventures consist of the following:\n•\nA combined joint venture with Air France, KLM and Virgin Atlantic with respect to transatlantic traffic flows. In addition to the joint venture, we own a non-controlling 49% equity stake in Virgin Atlantic Limited, the parent company of Virgin Atlantic Airways and a non-controlling 9% ownership stake in the parent company of Air France and KLM.\n•\nA joint venture with Aeroméxico with respect to trans-border traffic flows between the U.S. and Mexico, which we believe Aeroméxico intends to request the court’s approval to assume as part of its bankruptcy proceedings. In addition to the joint venture, we own a non-controlling 51% equity stake in Grupo Aeroméxico, S.A.B. de C.V., the parent company of Aeroméxico. We and Aeroméxico have also established a joint venture relating to an airframe MRO operation located in Queretaro, Mexico.\n•\nA joint venture with Korean Air with respect to traffic flows between the United States and certain countries in Asia. In addition to the joint venture, we own an approximately 13% equity stake in Hanjin-KAL, the largest shareholder of Korean Air.\nDuring 2020, our joint venture with Virgin Australia and its affiliated carriers was repudiated as part of the voluntary administration proceeding relating to the recapitalization of Virgin Australia’s business. We remain optimistic about restarting our joint venture relationship with Virgin Australia once demand recovers and it resumes long-haul international flights.\nIn 2019, we entered into a framework agreement with LATAM Airlines Group S.A. (“LATAM”) to form a strategic alliance. Pursuant to that agreement, we acquired a non-controlling 20% equity stake in LATAM in January 2020 for $1.9 billion and agreed to make transition payments to LATAM totaling $350 million. In May 2020, we signed a trans-American joint venture agreement with LATAM that, subject to regulatory approvals, will combine our highly complementary route networks between North and South America, with the goal of providing customers a seamless travel experience and industry-leading connectivity. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, LATAM initiated a voluntary proceeding to reorganize under U.S. bankruptcy laws in which it has assumed the joint venture agreement. As part of our planned strategic alliance with LATAM, we also assumed 10 of LATAM's A350 purchase commitments with Airbus S.A.S. for deliveries through 2025. We initially agreed to acquire four A350 aircraft from LATAM but terminated this agreement during 2020.\nWe previously entered into a joint venture agreement with WestJet with respect to trans-border traffic flows between the U.S. and Canada for which we sought antitrust immunity from DOT, among other regulatory approvals. In 2020, we withdrew the application for antitrust immunity and, as a result, we and WestJet are not currently implementing the proposed joint venture. We continue to explore avenues to deepen our relationship with WestJet and generate value for our customers.\nEnhanced Commercial Agreements with China Eastern.\nWe own a 3% equity interest in China Eastern, with whom we have a strategic joint marketing and commercial cooperation arrangement covering traffic flows between China and the U.S., which includes reciprocal codesharing, loyalty program participation, airport lounge access and joint sales cooperation.\nSkyTeam\n. In addition to our marketing alliance agreements with individual foreign airlines, we are a member of the SkyTeam global airline alliance. The other members of SkyTeam are Aeroflot, Aerolíneas Argentinas, Aeroméxico, Air Europa, Air France, Alitalia, China Airlines, China Eastern, Czech Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Kenya Airways, KLM, Korean Air, Middle East Airlines, Saudia, TAROM, Vietnam Airlines and Xiamen Airlines. Through alliance arrangements with other SkyTeam carriers, we are able to link our network with the route networks of the other member airlines, providing opportunities to increase connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through reciprocal codesharing and loyalty program participation, airport lounge access and cargo operations.\nRegional Carriers\nWe have air service agreements with domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in small and medium-sized cities in the domestic market. These arrangements enable us to better match capacity with demand in these markets.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               5\nItem 1. Business\nThrough our regional carrier program, Delta Connection\n®\n, we have contractual arrangements with regional carriers to operate aircraft using our \"DL\" designator code. We currently have contractual arrangements with:\n•\nEndeavor Air, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours.\n•\nRepublic Airline, Inc. (\"Republic\").\n•\nSkyWest Airlines, Inc. (\"SkyWest Airlines\").\nOur contractual agreements with regional carriers primarily are capacity purchase arrangements, under which we control the scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers' flights operating under our \"DL\" designator code. We are entitled to all ticket, cargo, mail, in-flight and ancillary revenues associated with the flights under these capacity purchase arrangements. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services. These capacity purchase agreements are long-term agreements, usually with initial terms of at least ten years, which grant us the option to extend the initial term. Certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement, or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement, for convenience at certain future dates.\nSkyWest Airlines operates some flights for us under a revenue proration agreement. This proration agreement establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries.\nGlobal Impact\nAs we connect people with communities, experiences and each other, we are committed to doing our part to build a better world. Giving back to the communities where we live, work and serve is part of our culture, and we have maintained this commitment through the COVID-19 pandemic, with Delta people shifting to virtual platforms and finding innovative, new ways to give back. For example, during 2020, Delta supported healthcare workers by manufacturing 70,000 face shields to extend the life of N95 mask respirators, donated 800,000 pounds of snacks and drinks to hospitals in 20 countries, and provided more than 350 free flights for medical professionals traveling to assist states that were heavily impacted by the pandemic.\nAs a purpose-driven and values-led company, we are committed to reducing our environmental impact. The chief focus of reducing our impact on the environment is jet fuel, which is the primary contributor to our carbon footprint. In February 2020, we announced plans to invest $1 billion in the next 10 years in our effort to achieve carbon neutrality, a commitment we have reiterated even with the unprecedented challenges presented for the airline industry by the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to focus on increasing fuel efficiency as we replace older aircraft with more fuel-efficient jets and improve the efficiency of our existing aircraft through operational efforts.\nOther Businesses\nCargo\nThrough our global network, our cargo operations are able to connect the world's major freight gateways. We have historically generated cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft. In 2020, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced industry capacity drove a significant increase in our cargo yield, and we also generated cargo revenue through the operation of cargo-only charter flights (i.e., using aircraft in our fleet not then being utilized for passenger travel). We are a member of SkyTeam Cargo, an international airline cargo alliance with 10 other airlines that offer a network spanning six continents, and aim to provide solutions across the globe by connecting our network with those of our partners.\nRelated Businesses\nWe have various other businesses arising from our airline operations, including the following:\n•\nIn addition to providing maintenance and engineering support for our fleet of approximately 1,100 mainline and regional aircraft, our MRO operation, known as Delta TechOps, serves aviation and airline customers from around the world.\n•\nOur vacation wholesale subsidiary, Delta Vacations, provides vacation packages to third-party consumers.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               6\nItem 1. Business\nIn January 2020, we combined Delta Private Jets, a former Delta subsidiary that provides aircraft charters, aircraft management and programs allowing members to purchase flight time by the hour, with Wheels Up. As of December 31, 2020, we owned a 24% equity stake in Wheels Up.\nIn 2019, the total revenue from these other businesses was approximately $1.2 billion. This revenue was reduced to approximately $650 million in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our deconsolidation of Delta Private Jets following the transaction with Wheels Up.\nEmployee Matters\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that Delta people are our strongest competitive advantage, and the high-quality service that they provide sets us apart from other airlines. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 74,000 people, of which approximately 72,000 were based in the U.S. In 2020, the dedication and determination of Delta people in response to the unprecedented challenges we faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic enabled us to avoid involuntary furloughs of U.S. employees, with approximately 50,000\nemployees volunteering to take unpaid leaves of absence, approximately 18,000 employees participating in early retirement and voluntary separation programs and from April 1 through December 31, 2020, most employees working reduced hours.\nOur principal human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop people who understand and are committed to delivering the “Delta Difference” that is core to our brand. To support these objectives, our human resources programs seek to:\n•\nPrepare our employees for key roles and future leadership positions through a variety of training and development programs.\n•\nReward our people through highly competitive total compensation and benefit programs designed to share our success, promote teamwork and support our people’s total wellbeing.\n•\nEnhance our culture through efforts aimed at making our workplace more engaging, equitable and inclusive.\n•\nDrive employees’ professional and community engagement.\nThe health and safety of our employees is foundational to achieving these objectives. We have long led the airline industry in employee safety and seek to achieve world-class personal safety performance.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we created pay protection programs for employees with symptoms, diagnosed, exposed or at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and established a notification process for potential COVID-19 exposure. We also assembled a COVID-19 task force to develop a series of safety measures in an effort to protect our employees and customers, including offering on-site rapid COVID-19 testing in most locations and making at-home testing available for all U.S.-based employees, and offering a return-to-work safety training program.\nOur commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is also critical to effective human capital management at Delta. As a global airline, we are in the business of bringing people together, and we believe our business should reflect the diversity of our customer base. To achieve this goal, we seek diverse talent internally and externally in an effort to achieve broader diverse representation throughout our organization. We also promote inclusion through education, training and development opportunities as well as by leveraging insights from our business resource groups, of which approximately one-third of our employees were members as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we intend to drive accountability for equitable outcomes by reviewing and revising systems, practices and policies and measuring inclusive behaviors, practices and representation. Two key areas on which we are focused are (1) reinforcement of our diverse talent pipeline by, among other things, requiring hiring candidate slates and interview panels to reflect diversity and giving equal consideration for accessible experience or certifications in an effort to remove unnecessary barriers, like college degrees, to certain roles and (2) closing diversity gaps in senior leadership positions by increasing the representation of minority and female officers, including doubling the number of black officers by 2025.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               7\nItem 1. Business\nWe believe that listening, engaging and connecting with employees furthers our human capital management objectives. We have historically done so primarily through our open-door policy, digital communication across all levels of the company, in-person events with senior management and company-wide and division-specific surveys to evaluate employee satisfaction. Since March 2020, senior management has participated in weekly company-wide virtual town hall discussions with our employees and our Chief Executive Officer has written weekly memos to all employees regarding our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our plan to take action on racial justice and diversity. We have also continued to conduct periodic employee surveys to seek feedback on wellbeing, communication and our COVID-19 response.\nCollective Bargaining\nAs of December 31, 2020,\n23% of our approximately 74,000 full-time equivalent employees were represented by unions. The following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions.\nWe are in mediated discussions with the representative of the Delta pilots regarding terms of their amendable collective bargaining agreement under the auspices of the National Mediation Board (\"NMB\").\nIn addition to the domestic airline employee groups discussed above, approximately 190 refinery employees of Monroe are represented by the United Steel Workers under an agreement that expires on February 28, 2022. This agreement is governed by the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\"), which generally allows either party to engage in self-help upon the expiration of the agreement. Certain of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by unions, work councils or other local representative groups.\nLabor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees, including at our operating subsidiaries, that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes.\nFuel\nOur results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. We purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market, from off-shore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price. We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, including fuel produced by Monroe or procured through the exchange of non-jet fuel products the refinery produces, and crude oil for Monroe's operations.\nThe following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs, which were materially reduced in 2020 in large part due to our reduced operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n(1)\nIncludes the operations of our regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements.\n(2)\nIncludes the impact of fuel hedge activity and refinery segment results.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               8\nItem 1. Business\nMonroe Energy\nOur wholly owned subsidiaries, Monroe Energy, LLC and MIPC, LLC (collectively, \"Monroe\"), operate the Trainer refinery and related assets located near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the Northeastern U.S., including our New York hubs at LaGuardia and JFK. These companies are distinct from us, operating under their own management teams and with their own boards of managers. We own Monroe as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel, as well as to maintain sufficiency of supply to our New York operations.\nRefinery Operations\n. The facility is capable of refining approximately 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day. In addition to jet fuel, the refinery's production consists of gasoline, diesel and other refined petroleum products (\"non-jet fuel products\"). Monroe sources domestic and foreign crude oil supply from a variety of providers. During 2020, the refinery operated at 60% – 90% of normal production levels, largely due to the significant decrease in the demand for jet fuel. Additionally, due to the decrease in demand for jet fuel, the refinery has shifted production to produce more non-jet fuel products.\nStrategic Agreements.\nMonroe has agreements in place to exchange the non-jet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations.\nFuel Hedging Program\nOur derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to Monroe’s inventory. We may utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets. We closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions, which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates.\nCompetition\nThe airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), operational reliability, services, products, customer service and loyalty programs. The industry has evolved through mergers and new entry, both domestically and internationally, and evolution in international alliances. Consolidation in the airline industry, the presence of subsidized government sponsored international carriers, changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered, and will continue to alter, the competitive landscape in the industry, resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with significant financial resources, extensive global networks and competitive cost structures. The COVID-19 pandemic could enhance the competitive dynamics within the industry, although we are unable to predict the duration and extent of this potentially increased pressure.\nDomestic\nOur domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, national point-to-point carriers, including Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, and other discount or ultra low-cost carriers, including Spirit Airlines, Frontier Airlines and Allegiant Air, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by Delta. Point-to-point, discount and ultra low-cost carriers place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market. In particular, we face significant competition at our domestic hubs and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and key airports. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers.\nInternational\nOur international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers, including from point-to-point carriers on certain international routes. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In particular, alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers, including SkyTeam, the Star Alliance (among United Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines, Air Canada and others) and the oneworld alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas and others) have enhanced competition in international markets.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               9\nItem 1. Business\nIn addition, several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers, including several of our joint ventures, have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among United Airlines, Air Canada and Lufthansa German Airlines, a transpacific joint venture between United Airlines and All Nippon Airways, a transatlantic joint venture among American Airlines, British Airways and Iberia, a transpacific joint venture between American Airlines and Japan Air Lines and a transpacific joint venture between American Airlines and Qantas.\nCompetition from government-owned and subsidized carriers in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, is also significant. Subsidies allowed these carriers to grow quickly prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of U.S. airlines.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (the \"FAA\") exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the U.S. The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation. An air carrier that the DOT finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation (including the carriage of passengers and cargo). Since the passage of the Airline Industry Deregulation Act in 1978, airlines have generally been free to launch or terminate service to U.S airports without restriction, except with respect to certain slot-controlled and schedule-facilitated airports, as well as certain constraints related to service to small communities governed by the \"Essential Air Services\" program. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 created certain continuation of service obligations in connection with the receipt of payroll support program funds by passenger airlines. Specifically, the DOT has the authority until March 1, 2022 to require airlines that received such funds to maintain scheduled air service deemed necessary to any point served by the airline before March 1, 2020. The DOT has issued two orders mandating such service, the most recent of which was finalized on January 15, 2021, mandating service levels through March 31, 2021, subject to certain definitions and exceptions as described in the order.\nThe DOT has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters, such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition, advertising, denied boarding compensation, baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between domestic and international carriers. The DOT engages in regulation of economic matters such as transactions involving allocation of \"slots\" or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at airports where such mechanisms are in place. The FAA has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including airline operating certificates, control of navigable air space, flight personnel, aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety.\nAuthority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. International certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the U.S. President for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives.\nThe Transportation Security Administration and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, each a division of the Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the U.S.\nAirlines are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail. Labor relations in the airline industry, as discussed below, are generally governed by the Railway Labor Act with oversight by the NMB. Environmental matters are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities. Privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations.\nFares and Rates\nAirlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation, and the industry is characterized by significant price competition. Certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the DOT and the governments of the foreign countries involved. Many of our tickets are sold by travel agents, and fares are subject to commissions, overrides and discounts paid to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               10\nItem 1. Business\nRoute Authority\nOur flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limited-entry frequency awards issued by the DOT. The requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements (and a multilateral agreement in the case of the U.S. and the European Union) with, or permits or approvals issued by, foreign countries. Because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the U.S. and the foreign country or countries involved, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations. Bilateral agreements between the U.S. and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time. The U.S. government has negotiated \"Open Skies\" agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted access between the U.S. and the foreign markets.\nCertain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements. We request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate. While the DOT usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service, there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal. Dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases, especially where another U.S. carrier indicates a willingness to provide service.\nAirport Access\nOperations at three major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of \"slots\" or similar regulatory mechanisms. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period.\nIn the U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of slots, slot exemptions, operating authorizations, or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at Reagan National in Washington, D.C. and LaGuardia and JFK in the New York City area. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations. Similarly, our operations at Tokyo's Haneda airport, London's Heathrow airport and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the International Air Transport Association's Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and applicable local law. We currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights, and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to do so in the future because, among other reasons, such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies.\nAirline Labor Regulation\nLabor unions representing airline employees in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act. Under the Railway Labor Act, a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the NMB an application alleging a representation dispute, along with authorization cards signed by at least 50% of the employees in that craft or class. The NMB then investigates the dispute and, if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards, conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class. A labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50% of votes cast are for representation. A certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer.\nUnder the Railway Labor Act, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. Either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may determine, at any time, that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration. If either party rejects binding arbitration, a 30-day \"cooling off\" period begins. At the end of this 30-day period, the parties may engage in “self-help,” unless the U.S. President appoints a Presidential Emergency Board (\"PEB\") to investigate and report on the dispute. The appointment of a PEB maintains the \"status quo\" for an additional 60 days. If the parties do not reach agreement during this period, the parties may then engage in self help. Self-help includes, among other things, a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline. The U.S. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent self-help by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               11\nItem 1. Business\nEnvironmental Regulation and Related Matters\nOur operations are subject to a number of international, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment, including regulation of greenhouse gases and other air emissions, noise reduction, water discharges, aircraft drinking water, storage and use of petroleum and other regulated substances, and the management and disposal of hazardous waste, substances and materials.\nEmissions\n. Carbon emissions by the aviation industry and their impact on climate change have become a particular focus in the international community and within the U.S. For several years, the European Union has required its member states to implement regulations to include aviation in its Emissions Trading Scheme (\"ETS\"). Under these regulations, any airline with flights originating or landing in the European Union is subject to the ETS and, beginning in 2012, was required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ETS. The ETS was amended to apply only to flights within the European Economic Area from 2013 through 2016. In 2017, the EU extended the exemption for foreign flights through 2023 based on the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (\"ICAO\") adoption of a global market-based program.\nIn 2016, ICAO formally adopted a global, market-based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"). This program establishes a medium-term goal for the aviation industry of achieving carbon-neutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021, based on a 2019 baseline. A pilot phase of the offset program will begin in 2021, followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 and a second phase beginning in 2027. Countries can voluntarily participate in the pilot and first phase, and the United States has agreed to participate in these voluntary phases. Participation in the second phase is mandatory for certain countries, including the United States. The U.S. government has not yet enacted legislation to mandate that U.S. operators participate in CORSIA. However, Delta submitted our CORSIA Emissions Monitoring Plan to the FAA in 2019 and in 2020, submitted our verified emissions report for 2019 international emissions.\nIn 2017, ICAO also adopted new aircraft certification standards to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from aircraft. The new aircraft certification standards apply to new fleet types in 2020 and to new in-production aircraft starting in 2023 but no later than 2028. These standards will not apply to existing in-service aircraft. However, exemption from the certification requirement could affect how these aircraft are treated under other programs governing CO2 emissions.\nIn 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") issued a final finding under the Clean Air Act that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare, and further determined that certain classes of aircraft engines cause or contribute to greenhouse gases. The endangerment finding did not establish standards, but triggered an obligation for the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain aircraft engines. In January 2021, the EPA finalized greenhouse gas emission standards for new aircraft engines designed to implement the ICAO standards on the same timeframe contemplated by ICAO. Like the ICAO standards, the final EPA standards would not apply to engines on in-service aircraft. The final standards have been challenged by several states and environmental groups, and the Biden administration has announced plans to review these final standards along with others issued by the prior administration. The outcome of the legal challenge and administrative review cannot be predicted at this time.\nThe airline industry may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the U.S. and abroad and become subject to further taxes, charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions. Additional regulation could result in taxation, regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for us and the airline industry. In addition to direct costs, such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations. Certain airports have also adopted, and others could in the future adopt, greenhouse gas emission or climate-related goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure. We are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such developments.\nIn February 2020, we announced plans to invest $1 billion in the next ten years in our effort to achieve carbon neutrality. As part of this plan, we seek to minimize the impact of carbon emissions from our operations and build on the reductions realized since 2005. We have improved the fuel efficiency of our aircraft through the retirement of older aircraft and their replacement with newer, more fuel efficient aircraft. In addition, we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions. We are also supporting efforts to develop sustainable alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the U.S. to further reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment. Beyond carbon reduction efforts, we expect carbon removal through investment in innovative projects and technologies and stakeholder engagement through coalitions intended to advance carbon reduction to be important aspects of our journey to carbon neutrality.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               12\nItem 1. Business\nNoise\n. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. This statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft first effective after October 1, 1990, require FAA approval. While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past, our operations could be adversely impacted if locally imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread. In addition, foreign governments may allow airports to enact similar restrictions, which could adversely impact our international operations or require significant expenditure in order for our aircraft to comply with the restrictions.\nRefinery Matters\n. Monroe's operation of the Trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas and other air emissions.\nUnder the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as expanded by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\") was created, setting up specific targets of renewable fuel to be used in the U.S. economy by mandating the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and on-road diesel (\"Transportation Fuels\"). Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\") are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the U.S. that are blended into Transportation Fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. A refinery may meet its obligation under RFS by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with Transportation Fuels or by purchasing RINs in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs. Because Monroe is able to blend only a small amount of renewable fuels, it must purchase the majority of its RINs requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the EPA. Market prices for RINs have been volatile, marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases primarily in response to predictions about what the EPA and/or the U.S. Congress will do with respect to compliance obligations.\nOther Environmental Matters\n. We are subject to certain environmental laws and contractual obligations governing the management and release of regulated substances, which may require the investigation and remediation of affected sites. Soil and/or ground water impacts have been identified at certain of our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports. To address these impacts, we have a program in place to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate these sites. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCivil Reserve Air Fleet Program\nWe participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program (the \"CRAF Program\"), which permits the U.S. military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating U.S. airlines during airlift emergencies, national emergencies or times of war. We have agreed to make available under the CRAF Program a portion of our international aircraft during the contract period ending September 30, 2022\n.\nThe CRAF Program has only been activated twice since it was created in 1951.\nAdditional Information\nWe make available free of charge on our website at\nir.delta.com\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").

    "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following material risk factors applicable to Delta. As described below, these risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future.\nRisk Factors Relating to Delta\nThe rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus, the persistence of the resulting pandemic and measures implemented to combat it have had, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, the longer the pandemic persists, the more material the ultimate effects are likely to be. It is likely that there will be future negative effects that we cannot presently predict, including near term effects.\nThe rapid spread of COVID-19 and the persistence of the resulting pandemic, as well as the measures governments and private parties have implemented in order to stem the spread of this pandemic, have had, and are continuing to have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel, and consequently upon our business. Among other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting air travel and our business:\n•\nIn the United States, which is our primary market, the federal government has discouraged travel and encouraged social distancing efforts and limits on gathering size.\n•\nNumerous travel advisories and restrictions have been implemented, some of which remain in place, between the United States and specific countries, and many foreign governments have placed restrictions or quarantines on citizens of other countries, including citizens of the U.S., flying into their countries. For instance, the U.S. and numerous other countries are now requiring airline passengers to provide negative COVID-19 test results prior to travel into their countries.\n•\nState and local governments have issued travel restrictions, quarantines and advisories and health-related curfews or “shelter in place” orders which dissuade or restrict air travel.\n•\nEmployers in both the public and private sectors have issued instructions to employees to work from home and/or are otherwise dissuading or restricting air travel.\n•\nBusiness conventions and conferences, concerts and similar entertainment have been and continue to be cancelled. Many popular tourist destinations have been, and remain, closed, or operations are curtailed. Significant sporting events have been, and occasionally continue to be, cancelled or held with limited or no spectators. All of these adjustments reduce the demand for both business air travel (which has historically driven our most profitable ticket sales) and leisure air travel.\n•\nTravelers are discouraged from air travel to destinations where COVID-19 is particularly virulent.\n•\nWidespread consumer confidence in air travel may not return until large-scale vaccination has occurred, and contagion or virus-related deaths linked or alleged to be linked to travel on aircraft, whether accurate or not, may hinder restoration of this confidence and, if related to our aircraft, injure our reputation.\n•\nTravelers may be dissuaded from flying due to possible enhanced COVID-19-related screening measures, which have been implemented to varying degrees and in different ways across multiple markets we serve, or due to the concern that additional travel restrictions implemented between their departure and return may affect their ability to return to their homes.\nThese effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic are negatively impacting air travel in general, which in turn are materially adversely affecting our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Although certain of the restrictions above have eased in some places, the ongoing pandemic, including large outbreaks, resurgences of COVID-19 in various regions and appearances of new variants of the virus, has resulted, and may continue to result, in their reinstitution. The effectiveness of the available vaccines against certain of these new variants is also unknown. Moreover, additional currently unknown restrictions or other events dissuading air travel may occur in the future as a result of the pandemic (including possibly in the near term), lengthening the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. For example, the federal government is contemplating whether to require COVID-19 testing in advance of domestic travel.\nOur operations have been, and could in the future be, negatively affected further if our employees are quarantined or sickened as a result of exposure to COVID-19, or if they are subject to additional governmental COVID-19 curfews or “shelter in place” health orders or similar restrictions. Measures restricting the ability of our airport or in-flight employees to come to work may cause a further deterioration in our service or operations, all of which could negatively affect our business.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               14\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn response to the crisis, we have taken steps to mitigate the effects on our business, which themselves may have negative consequences with respect to our business and operations. For example, we have significantly reduced our flight capacity and have blocked middle seats on flights through at least April 30, 2021. However, the cost savings achievable with temporary capacity reductions will not completely eliminate the costs related to unused capacity. In addition, to protect the safety of our employees and customers, we have implemented significant additional cleaning measures on all of our aircraft and at the airports in which we operate.\nFurthermore, we have waived air travel booking change fees to a broad extent and extended the ability to rebook that travel through December 2022 in order to encourage travelers to book air travel (or not cancel already booked travel) despite the inherent uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these efforts, we have experienced significant ticket cancellations. Cancellations, the waiver, and in many cases elimination, of change fees and other refunds have negatively affected our revenues and liquidity.\nUltimately, cost-saving measures that we implemented in 2020, or may consider in the future, have not made up, and will not in the future make-up, for the loss in cash as a result of decreased ticket sales and cancellations and could also negatively affect our service to customers. The pandemic is also having a material adverse effect on third parties whose services we utilize, including other carriers with which we have commercial relationships (international carriers and regional carriers in the Delta Connection program) and providers of ground services at some airports, which may also negatively affect our service to customers.\nWe are unable to predict how long conditions related to the pandemic will persist, when effective vaccines will be broadly available, when vaccination will be widespread globally, when travel advisories and restrictions will be lifted, what additional measures may be introduced by governments or private parties or what effect any such additional measures may have on air travel and our business. The overall situation remains fluid, and it is impossible to predict the timing of future material developments and whether they will occur in the near, medium or long term. Depending on the duration of the pandemic, such negative developments may occur over the entirety of the pandemic.\nAt this time, we are also not able to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may result in permanent changes to our customers' behavior, with such changes including but not limited to a permanent reduction in business travel as a result of increased usage of \"virtual\" meetings and \"teleconferencing\" products and more broadly, a general reluctance to travel by consumers, each of which could have a material impact on our business.\nCollectively, the foregoing circumstances have had, and are continuing to have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Future disease outbreaks or similar public health threats could have similar effects.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Form 10-K and in other filings we make from time to time with the SEC.\nWe have a significant amount of fixed obligations and incurred significant amounts of new debt in a short period in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Insufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business.\nWe have a significant amount of existing fixed obligations, including aircraft lease and debt financings, leases of airport property and other facilities, and other material cash obligations. In response to the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our business, we have incurred and may continue to seek significant amounts of additional liquidity through the issuance of debt securities or through bilateral and syndicated secured and/or unsecured credit facilities and through the entry into sale-leaseback transactions. In addition, we have substantial commitments for capital expenditures.\nWe had approximately $16.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities (\"liquidity\") as of December 31, 2020; however, our future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this Form 10-K, and in other filings we may make from time to time with the SEC. If our liquidity is materially diminished, we might not be able to timely pay our leases and debts or comply with certain financial covenants in our financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of our contractual obligations.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               15\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAgreements governing our debt, including our credit facilities and our SkyMiles financing agreements, include financial and other covenants. Certain of these covenants impose restrictions on our business, and failure to comply with any of the covenants in these agreements could result in events of default.\nOur debt agreements contain various affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including our credit facilities and our SkyMiles financing agreements, each of which contains a minimum liquidity covenant. Certain of our debt agreements also contain collateral coverage ratios, and our SkyMiles financing agreements contain a debt service coverage ratio. A decline in these coverage ratios, including due to factors that are beyond our control, could require us to post additional collateral or trigger an early amortization event. Our SkyMiles financing agreements also restrict our ability to, among other things, change the policies and procedures of the SkyMiles program in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially impair repayment of our SkyMiles debt.\nComplying with certain of the covenants in our debt agreements and other restrictive covenants that may be contained in any future debt agreements could limit our ability to operate our business and to take advantage of business opportunities that are in our long-term interest. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants.\nWhile the covenants in our debt agreements are subject to important exceptions and qualifications, if we fail to comply with them and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, refinance the indebtedness subject to these covenants or take other mitigating actions, an event of default would result. These arrangements also contain other events of default customary for such financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders or noteholders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable and where applicable and subject to the terms of relevant collateral agreements, repossess collateral, including aircraft or other valuable assets. In addition, an event of default or acceleration of indebtedness under one agreement could result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements. The acceleration of significant indebtedness could require us to seek to renegotiate, repay or refinance the obligations under our financing arrangements, and there is no assurance that such renegotiation or refinancing efforts would be successful.\nWe are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft or aircraft of our airline partners.\nAn aircraft crash or other serious accident involving our aircraft or those of our airline partners could expose Delta to significant liability. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient.\nIn addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare, alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety and reliability for aviation authorities and the public, which could harm our reputation, resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business.\nBreaches or lapses in the security of the technology systems we use and rely on and the data stored within them could compromise sensitive information and expose us to liability, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a regular part of our ordinary business operations, we collect and store sensitive data, including information necessary for our operations, personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners. The secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy.\nOur information systems and those of our service providers are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks, and the increase in work-from-home arrangements since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to enhance these risks. We expect unauthorized parties to continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or information, or those of our business partners and service providers, including through fraud or other means of deception, or introduction of malicious code, such as viruses, worms, Trojan horses and ransomware. If successful, these actions could cause harm to our computer systems or compromise data stored on our computer networks or those of our business partners and service providers. Hardware or software we or our business partners or service providers develop, acquire or use in connection with our systems may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security. For example, we were notified in 2018 that a third-party vendor of chat services for Delta and other companies determined we had been involved in a cyber incident for a short period in 2017. We have incurred remedial, legal and other costs in connection with this incident but the costs are not material to our financial position or results of operations.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               16\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. As a result of these types of risks and regular attacks on our systems, we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data. In addition to continuously assessing risk and reviewing our procedures, processes and technologies, we continue to educate our people about these risks and to monitor, review and update the process and control requirements we expect third parties and vendors to leverage and implement for the protection of information regarding our customers, employees or business partners that is in their care. However, the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all information security breaches or misuse of data.\nThe compromise of our or our business partners’ or service providers’ technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, our information or that of our customers, employees or business partners or failure to comply with ever-evolving regulatory obligations or contractual obligations with respect to such information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. The costs to remediate breaches and similar system compromises that do occur could be material. In addition, as cybercriminals become more sophisticated, the cost of proactive defensive measures continues to increase.\nDisruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.\nDisruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems, whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third-party locations, or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend, such as power, telecommunications or the internet. The operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. A significant individual, sustained or repeated failure of our information technology infrastructure, including third-party networks we utilize and on which we depend, could impact our operations and our customer service, result in increased costs and damage our reputation. While we have in place initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans (including the creation of a back-up data center) and continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans, we have previously experienced infrastructure disruptions and these measures may not be adequate to prevent a future business disruption and any material adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business.\nFailure of the technology we use to perform effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent on technology initiatives to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, substantially all of our tickets are issued to our customers as electronic tickets, and a growing number of our customers check in using our website, airport kiosks and our mobile device applications. We have made and continue to make significant investments in customer facing technology such as delta.com, mobile device applications, in-flight wireless internet, check-in kiosks, customer service applications, application of biometric technology, airport information displays and related initiatives, including security for these initiatives. We are also investing in significant upgrades to technology infrastructure and other supporting systems and transitioning to cloud-based technologies. The performance, reliability and security of the technology we use are critical to our ability to serve customers. If this technology does not perform effectively, including as a result of the implementation or integration of new or upgraded technologies or systems, our business and operations would be negatively affected, which could be material.\nOur commercial relationships with airlines in other parts of the world and the investments that we have in certain of those carriers may not produce the results or returns we expect.\nAn important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to develop and expand strategic relationships with a number of airlines through joint ventures and other forms of cooperation and support, including equity investments. We expect to continue exploring ways to deepen our alliance relationships with other carriers as part of our global business strategy. These relationships and investments involve significant challenges and risks, including that they may not generate the expected financial results or that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment. We are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               17\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the operations of our airline partners and could adversely affect the expansion of strategic relationships in the future. These carriers have incurred significant financial losses as a result of the pandemic, and some have been or may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws. For example, since the onset of the pandemic, LATAM Airlines and Grupo Aeroméxico filed voluntary proceedings to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the United States bankruptcy code, Virgin Australia entered voluntary administration in Australia in order to recapitalize its business and repudiated our joint venture agreement, and Virgin Atlantic undertook a voluntary recapitalization process in the U.K. and instituted ancillary proceedings in support of that process in the U.S. As discussed further in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with these actions, caused us to reduce our carrying value in the equity investments we have in certain of these carriers to zero. If any airline partners that seek to restructure are unable to do so successfully or if our commercial arrangements with these partners are not maintained, any investments or other assets associated with those partners could become impaired, and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA significant disruption in, or other problems with respect to, the operations or performance of third parties on which we rely, including third-party carriers, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on the operations and performance of third parties in a number of areas that are important to our business, including third-party regional carriers, international alliance partners and ground operation providers at some airports. While we have agreements with certain of these third parties that define expected service performance, we do not have direct control over their operations. To the extent that the operations of a third party on which we rely is significantly disrupted, or if these third parties experience significant performance issues (including failing to satisfy any applicable performance standards) or fail to meet any applicable compliance requirements, our revenue may be reduced, our expenses may be increased and our reputation may be harmed, any or all of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or our long-lived assets, causing us to record impairments that may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, we are required to test our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently where there is an indication of impairment. In addition, we are required to test certain of our other assets for impairment where there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded significant impairment and related charges related to acceleration of our fleet simplification strategy and the write-down of investments in certain airline partners, stemming from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe may be required to recognize losses in the future due to, among other factors, extreme fuel price volatility, tight credit markets, government regulatory changes, decline in the fair values of certain tangible or intangible assets, such as aircraft, route authorities, and airport slots, unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment, as well as other uncertainties. A further impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEmployee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our\noperations.\nOur business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, aircraft maintenance technicians, ground support personnel and other personnel. As of December 31, 2020, 23% of our workforce, primarily pilots, was unionized. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self-help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted. The collective bargaining agreement with our pilots became amendable on December 31, 2019 and we are in discussions with the representative of the pilots regarding terms of the agreement under the auspices of the NMB. Separately, the NLRA governs\nMonroe’s\nrelations with the union representing their employees, which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               18\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIf we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act or the NLRA, as the case may be. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. Likewise, if third-party regional carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather, natural disasters and seasonality.\nOur results of operations are impacted by severe weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters (or other environmental events) can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems. These events decrease revenue and can also increase costs. In addition, increases in the frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons or other severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate, could result in increases in delays and cancellations, turbulence-related injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather, any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs. In addition, demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and September quarters, particularly in our international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year. The seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis. Because of fluctuations in our results from weather, natural disasters and seasonality, results of operations for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a future period and results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for an entire year.\nOur business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs or cost increases, including in the cost of crude oil, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. Over the last decade, fuel prices have been highly volatile and at times have increased substantially. From 2017 to 2020, our average annual fuel price per gallon, including the impact of fuel hedges, has varied from $1.64 to $2.20 with year to year variations ranging from a decrease of 19% to an increase of 31%.\nWe acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from Monroe and through strategic agreements that Monroe has with third parties. The cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel. In addition, we have historically purchased a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from Monroe. Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices.\nThe competitive nature of the airline industry may affect our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers. In addition, because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel, a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase. At times in the past, we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs, and we may not be able to do so in the future.\nSignificant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel, including from Monroe, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and results of operations.\nWeather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or taxes, changes in refining capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future. Shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we acquire a significant amount of our jet fuel from Monroe, the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations. Disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure, interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil, work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, or damage from severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism. If the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               19\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIf Monroe's cost of producing non-jet fuel products exceeds the value it receives for those products, the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAn environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the Monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results if insurance is unable to cover a significant liability. In addition, such an incident could damage our reputation.\nMonroe's refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions and natural catastrophes. Monroe could incur substantial losses, including cleanup costs, fines and other sanctions and third-party claims, and its operations could be interrupted, as a result of such an incident. Monroe's insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities, and Monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage. In addition, Monroe's ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. If Monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position. In addition, because of our ownership of Monroe, the occurrence of an environmental or other incident could result in damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe operation of the refinery by Monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation. Failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.\nMonroe’s operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions, which are subject to change over time. Monroe could incur fines and other sanctions, cleanup costs and third-party claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety requirements, which if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results. In addition, the enactment of new, more stringent environmental laws and regulations, including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for Monroe or restrict its operations.\nIn particular, under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA has adopted RFS that mandates the blending of renewable fuels into Transportation Fuels. RINs are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the U.S. that are blended into Transportation Fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. A refinery may meet its obligation under RFS by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with Transportation Fuels or by purchasing RINs in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs.\nBecause Monroe is able to blend only a small amount of renewable fuels, it must purchase the majority of its RIN requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the EPA. As a result, Monroe is exposed to the market price of RINs. Market prices for RINs have been volatile, marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases primarily in response to predictions about what the EPA and/or the U.S. Congress will do with respect to compliance obligations. We cannot predict these actions or the future prices of RINs. During 2020, Monroe's operating loss was driven in part by an increase in RINs prices. Monroe’s purchase of RINs at elevated prices in the future could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\nExisting laws or regulations could change, and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase. Increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into Monroe’s products could limit the refinery’s production if sufficient numbers of RINs are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.\nIf we lose senior management and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, or we otherwise fail to maintain our company culture, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees and we are not able to replace these persons with individuals with comparable skills, or we otherwise fail to maintain our company culture, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified senior management and other key personnel as needed in the future.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               20\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nSignificant damage to our reputation and brand, including as a result of significant adverse publicity, could materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nMaintaining our reputation and global brand are critical to our business. We operate in a highly visible, public environment with significant, real-time exposure to traditional and social media. Adverse publicity, whether justified or not, can rapidly spread, including through social or digital media. In particular, passengers can use social media to portray interactions with Delta, without context, in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent we are unable to respond in a timely and appropriate manner to adverse publicity, our brand and reputation may be damaged.\nOur reputation and brand could also be adversely impacted by, among other things, failure to make progress toward and achieve our environmental sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion goals, as well as public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies or negative public perception of the environmental impact of air travel. Significant damage to our reputation and brand could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               21\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factors Relating to the Airline Industry\nTerrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or the fear or threat of any of these events, could have a significant adverse effect on our business. Despite significant security measures at airports and airlines, the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups. We rely on government provided threat intelligence and utilize private sources to constantly monitor for threats from terrorist groups and individuals, including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically, with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry. In addition, the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant. Security events, primarily from external sources but also from potential insider threats, also pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations. These events could include random acts of violence and could occur in public areas that we cannot control.\nTerrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or the fear or threat of any of these events, even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry, could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying, leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds. In addition, potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs, impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring or could occur, such as flight redirections or cancellations, reputational harm and other costs. If any or all of these types of events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe global airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and results from operations will be materially adversely affected.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), operational reliability, services, products, customer service and loyalty programs. Consolidation in the airline industry, changes in international alliances, the creation of immunized joint ventures and the rise of subsidized government sponsored international carriers have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry, resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures. The COVID-19 pandemic could enhance the competitive dynamics within the industry, although we are unable to predict the duration or extent of this potentially increased pressure.\nOur domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, national point-to-point carriers, including Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, and other discount or ultra low-cost carriers, including Spirit Airlines, Frontier Airlines and Allegiant Air, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by Delta. Point-to-point, discount and ultra low-cost carriers place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market. In particular, we face significant competition at our domestic hubs and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and key airports. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers. Our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers, including from point-to-point carriers on certain international routes. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In addition, several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Competition from government-owned and subsidized carriers in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, has also been significant. Subsidies allowed these carriers to grow quickly prior to the pandemic, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of U.S. airlines.\nThe airline industry also faces competition from surface transportation and technological alternatives such as “virtual” meetings or “teleconferencing,” and the intensity of this competition has likely increased, at least in the near term, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               22\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nExtended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports in which we operate or significant problems associated with a type of aircraft or engine we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the United States and throughout the world. An extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, the airline industry is heavily dependent on a limited number of aircraft and engine manufacturers whose products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Any significant problems associated with an aircraft or engine type that we operate, such as design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public leading to customer avoidance or adverse actions by the FAA resulting in grounding could have a negative impact on our operations if we are not able to substitute or replace the affected aircraft or engine type and could, in any event, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, which is costly and could materially adversely affect our business.\nAirlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs and may have material adverse effects on our business. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring significant expenses to comply with the FAA’s regulations.\nOther laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations, reduce revenues or otherwise impact our business. The industry is heavily taxed. Additional taxes and fees, if implemented, could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAirport slot access is subject to government regulation and changes in slot regulations or allocations could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in airports subject to such regulations or allocations or otherwise adversely affect an airline’s business.\nCertain of our hubs are among the most congested airports in the United States and have been, and could in the future be, the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights and/or increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day. Air traffic control inefficiencies can also enhance these pressures.\nIn addition, the failure of the federal government to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system, which is regulated by the FAA, has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets. The failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for U.S. air travel increases, having a material adverse effect on our operations. Failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs an international carrier, we are subject to a wide variety of U.S. and foreign laws that affect trade, including tariff and trade policies, export and import requirements, taxes, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges. In connection with a dispute brought at the World Trade Organization against the EU and certain member states to address state subsidies in the large civil aircraft sector, the U.S. Trade Representative has imposed tariffs on certain products imported from the EU, including on certain new aircraft and certain airplane parts originating in France and Germany. We are pursuing strategies to minimize the impact, if any, of these tariffs on our business, but they, or the imposition of future tariffs, have the potential to substantially increase the cost to Delta of the affected aircraft, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIn addition, some of our operations are in high-risk legal compliance environments. Failure to comply with trade sanctions, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and other applicable laws or regulations could result in litigation, assessment of damages, imposition of penalties or other consequences, any or all of which could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our financial results. In certain circumstances, we also may be subject to consequences of the failure of our airline partners to comply with laws and regulations, including U.S. laws to which they may be subject such as the FCPA.\nWe and other U.S. carriers are subject to U.S. and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the U.S., certain European government agencies have updated privacy regulations applicable to private industry, including airlines. Ongoing compliance with these evolving regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our future operations.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               23\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe airline industry is subject to many forms of environmental regulation, including increased regulation to reduce emissions and other risks associated with climate change. Failure to comply with existing or future environmental regulations or to otherwise manage the risks of climate change effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany aspects of our operations are subject to evolving and increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws governing the protection of the environment. Compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations could require capital investment and increase operational costs, and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties and reputational harm.\nFuture regulatory action concerning climate change, aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry. In order to address aircraft carbon dioxide emissions, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations specialized agency, formally adopted a global, market-based emission offset program known as CORSIA. This program establishes a medium-term goal for the aviation industry of achieving carbon-neutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021, based on a 2019 baseline. Certain CORSIA program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the pilot phase of the program, and thus the impact of CORSIA cannot be fully predicted at this time. However, CORSIA is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally.\nIn addition to CORSIA, we may face a patchwork of regulation of aircraft emissions in the U.S. and abroad and could become subject to further taxes, charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions. Additional regulation could result in taxation, regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for the airline industry, including Delta. In addition to direct costs, such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations. While the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict, new laws or regulations related to environmental matters adopted in the U.S. or other countries could impose significant additional costs on or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Certain airports have also adopted, and others could in the future adopt, greenhouse gas emission or climate-related goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure.\nFinally, there is uncertainty with respect to the future supply, demand and price of sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuel, carbon offset credits and technologies that could allow us to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide.\nBecause of the global nature of our business, unfavorable economic or political conditions in the markets in which we operate or volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAs a result of the discretionary nature of air travel, the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Because we operate globally, our business is subject to economic and political conditions throughout the world. During periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the economy in the U.S. or abroad, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the worldwide response to it, demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel, seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business using technological alternatives. If unfavorable economic conditions occur, particularly for an extended period, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur international operations are an important part of our route network. Political disruptions and instability around the world can negatively impact the demand and network availability for air travel. Additionally, any deterioration in global trade relations, such as increased tariffs or other trade barriers, could result in a decrease in the demand for international air travel."

    "text": "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nFlight Equipment\nWe have restructured our aircraft order books for future aircraft deliveries and as of December 31, 2020 removed from active service approximately 350 mainline and regional aircraft to align capacity with customer demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 125 mainline and regional aircraft were temporarily parked. Additionally, 227 aircraft were permanently parked as a result of the early retirements described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs we obtain greater clarity around the duration and extent of reduced demand and potentially execute further capacity adjustments, we will continue to evaluate our current fleet compared to network requirements and may decide to retire additional aircraft. Future decisions regarding the timing of returning temporarily parked aircraft to service will be dependent on the evolution of the demand environment. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fleet retirements.\nOur operating aircraft fleet, commitments and options at December 31, 2020 are summarized in the following table:\n(1)\nExcludes certain aircraft we own, lease or have committed to purchase (including\none\nCRJ-900 aircraft) that are operated by regional carriers on our behalf shown in the table below.\n(2)\nPurchase commitments include one A330-900neo lease commitment in 2021 incremental to our order book with Airbus.\nWe have assumed 10 of LATAM's A350 purchase commitments from Airbus, with deliveries through 2025, which are included as purchase commitments in the above table. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our strategic alliance with LATAM.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               25\nItem 2. Properties\nThe following table summarizes the 340 aircraft operated by regional carriers on our behalf at December 31, 2020. We have also temporarily parked approximately 35 regional aircraft as of December 31, 2020.\nIn 2020, Compass Airlines, Inc. (\"Compass\") and GoJet Airlines, LLC (\"GoJet\") ceased operations on our behalf. Aircraft previously operated by Compass and GoJet are now being operated by our other regional carriers and are reflected in the table below.\n(1)\nEndeavor Air, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta.\nAircraft Purchase Commitments\nAs part of a multi-year effort, we have been investing in new aircraft to provide an improved customer experience, greater fuel efficiency, better operating economics and more premium products. In 2020, we restructured our aircraft order books with Airbus and MHI RJ Aviation Group (manufacturer of CRJ aircraft) in an effort to better match the timing of aircraft deliveries with our network and financial needs over the next several years. The restructuring reduced our aircraft purchase commitments by more than $2 billion in 2020 and by more than $5 billion through 2022. The shift in delivery timing is intended to allow us to continue simplifying and modernizing our fleet while maintaining our Airbus order book.\nOur purchase commitments for additional aircraft at December 31, 2020 are detailed in the following table:\n(1)\nIncludes one A330-900neo lease commitment in 2021 incremental to our order book with Airbus.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               26\nItem 2. Properties\nGround Facilities\nAirline Operations\nWe lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy. Our largest aircraft maintenance base, various equipment maintenance, cargo, flight kitchen and training facilities and most of our principal offices are located at or near the Atlanta airport on land leased from the City of Atlanta. We lease ticket counters, gate areas, operating facilities and other terminal space in most of the airports that we serve. At most airports, we have entered into use agreements which provide for the non-exclusive use of runways, taxiways and other improvements and facilities; landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft. These leases and use agreements generally run for periods of less than one year to 30 years or more, and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates, landing fees and other charges applicable under that type of agreement. We also lease aircraft maintenance, equipment maintenance and air cargo facilities at several airports. Our facility leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing, operating and maintaining such facilities, including, in some cases, amounts necessary to pay debt service on special facility bonds issued to finance their construction. We also lease computer facilities, marketing offices, reservations offices and other off-airport facilities in certain locations for varying terms.\nWe own our Atlanta reservations center, other real property in Atlanta and reservations centers in Minot, North Dakota and Chisholm, Minnesota.\nRefinery Operations\nOur wholly owned subsidiaries, Monroe and MIPC, own and operate the Trainer refinery and related assets in Pennsylvania. The facility includes pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the Northeastern U.S., including our New York hubs at LaGuardia and JFK."

    "text": "Capacity Antitrust Litigation\nIn July 2015, a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed alleging that Delta, American, United and Southwest had conspired to restrain capacity. The lawsuits were filed in the wake of media reports that the U.S. Department of Justice had served civil investigative demands upon these carriers seeking documents and information relating to this subject. The lawsuits have been consolidated into a single Multi-District Litigation proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. In November 2016, the District Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the claims, and the matter is now proceeding through discovery. Delta believes the claims in these cases are without merit and is vigorously defending these lawsuits."

In March 2020 we suspended future dividends due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act payroll support program initially restricted the payment of dividends through September 2021, which has been continued to March 2022 under the terms of the payroll support program extension. Dividend payments beyond that time will be dependent upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total returns during the period from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2020 of our common stock to the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index and the NYSE ARCA Airline Index. The comparison assumes $100 was invested on December 31, 2015 in each of our common stock and the indices and assumes that all dividends were reinvested.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               28\nItem 5. Market Information\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table presents information with respect to purchases of common stock we made during the December 2020 quarter. In March 2020, we suspended our share repurchase program due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and are restricted from conducting share repurchases through March 2022 under the payroll support program extension. Therefore, there were no shares repurchased in the December 2020 quarter pursuant to our share repurchase program.\nThe table reflects shares withheld from employees to satisfy certain tax obligations due in connection with grants of stock under the Delta Air Lines, Inc. Performance Compensation Plan (the \"Plan\"). The Plan provides for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax obligations. It does not specify a maximum number of shares that can be withheld for this purpose. The shares of common stock withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations may be deemed to be \"issuer purchases\" of shares that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this Item."

    "text": "This section of Form 10-K does not address certain items regarding the year ended December 31, 2018. Discussion and analysis of 2018 and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe unprecedented, widespread and persistent impact of COVID-19 and the related travel restrictions and social distancing measures implemented throughout the world have significantly reduced demand for air travel. After initially impacting our service to China beginning in January 2020, the spread of the virus and the resulting global pandemic have significantly affected our entire network. Beginning in March 2020, large public events were cancelled, governmental authorities began imposing restrictions on non-essential activities, businesses suspended travel and popular leisure destinations temporarily closed to visitors. Certain countries that are key markets for our business have imposed bans on international travelers for specified periods or indefinitely.\nAs a result, demand for travel declined at a rapid pace in the March 2020 quarter and has remained depressed, which has had an unprecedented and materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. Although demand has improved at a slow pace since that time, it remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since experienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, while others, particularly international markets, remain closed or are enforcing extended quarantines for most U.S. residents. The U.S. and numerous other countries are now also requiring airline passengers to provide negative COVID-19 test results prior to travel into their countries. Additionally, some states have instituted travel restrictions, advisories or quarantines for travelers from other states within the U.S. We expect the demand environment to remain depressed until effective vaccines become broadly available, vaccination becomes widespread globally and travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease. Our forecasted expense and liquidity management initiatives may be modified as the demand environment evolves.\nIn response to these developments, we have implemented enhanced measures focusing on the safety of our customers and employees, while at the same time seeking to mitigate the impact on our financial position and operations and to position our business for recovery.\nTaking Care of our Customers and Employees.\nThe safety of our customers and employees is our primary focus. As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, we have taken numerous steps to help promote the safety of our customers and employees on the ground and in the air in keeping with current health-expert recommendations, including:\n•\nAdopting new cleaning procedures on all flights, including regular disinfectant electrostatic spraying on aircraft and sanitizing high-touch areas like tray tables, entertainment screens, armrests and seat-back pockets.\n•\nTaking steps to help employees and customers practice social distancing and promote safety, including:\n◦\nCreating a Global Cleanliness Division to ensure a consistently safe and sanitized experience across our facilities and aircraft.\n◦\nBeginning in May 2020, requiring all customers and customer-facing employees to wear masks.\n◦\nCapping load factors throughout our aircraft and blocking middle seats through at least April 30, 2021.\n◦\nModifying our boarding and deplaning processes, while providing limited food and beverage service that is designed to reduce physical touch points.\n◦\nEncouraging social distancing throughout all aspects of our operation.\n◦\nImplementing significant workforce social distancing and protection measures, including reconfiguring call center spaces to promote social distancing, increasing cleaning and disinfecting of our facilities and encouraging employees to work remotely when possible.\n•\nGiving customers flexibility to plan and re-book travel, including extending expiration on certain tickets and travel credits through December 2022, eliminating change fees for domestic tickets and international tickets originating from North America, with the exception of Basic Economy tickets, and waiving change fees for all tickets purchased before March 30, 2021. Additionally, we are extending 2020 Medallion Status an additional year, rolling Medallion Qualification Miles into 2021 and extending Delta SkyMiles American Express Card benefits and Delta Sky Club memberships.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               30\nItem 7. MD&A - Financial Highlights\n•\nOffering pay protection to employees who have tested positive for COVID-19, who must quarantine due to exposure to COVID-19, who are considered being at high-risk for illness from COVID-19 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") guidelines and do not have the ability to work remotely.\n•\nOffering on-site rapid COVID-19 testing in most locations and making at-home testing available for all U.S.-based employees. We have also added rapid testing in most U.S. hubs for active flight crews.\nCapacity Reductions.\nBeginning in the second half of March 2020, we experienced a precipitous decrease in demand as COVID-19 spread throughout the world. While we have increased capacity compared to the lowest levels in April 2020, system capacity remains significantly lower than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2020, system capacity was reduced approximately\n50% compared to 2019, with international capacity reduced by approximately 65% and domestic capacity reduced by approximately 45%. System capacity for the March 2020 through December 2020 period, excluding the pre-pandemic months of January and February, was reduced by approximately 60%, with international capacity reduced by approximately 75% and domestic capacity reduced by approximately 50%. For the March 2021 quarter, system capacity is expected to be down approximately\n30%-40% compared to the March 2019 quarter. As a result of reduced demand and lower capacity, we retired 227 aircraft in 2020 and have temporarily parked approximately 125 aircraft as of December 31, 2020.\nExpense Management.\nIn response to the reduction in revenue, we have implemented, and will continue to implement, cost saving initiatives, including the following in 2020:\n•\nReducing capacity as described above to align with expected demand, which has resulted in removing from active service approximately 350 aircraft as of December 31, 2020, including certain fleets or aircraft that we have decided to early retire as described below.\n•\nConsolidating our footprint at our airport facilities, including temporarily closing some Delta Sky Clubs.\n•\nAvoiding furloughs for our U.S. employees and reducing employee-related costs, through the following:\n◦\nVoluntary unpaid leaves of 30 days to 12 months offered to most employees. Approximately\n50,000 of our employees have taken or have elected to take voluntary leaves at various times during 2020 and, for those taking leaves up to 12 months, continuing through 2021.\n◦\nOffering employees early retirement and voluntary separation programs, with approximately 18,000 employees electing to participate.\nSee Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n◦\nReaching an agreement with ALPA that protects our pilots from furlough through April 2022.\n◦\nFrom April 1 through December 31, 2020, salary reductions of 100% for our CEO, 50% for our officers and a 25% reduction in work hours for all other management and most front-line employee work groups.\n•\nDelaying or eliminating nearly all other discretionary spending.\nBalance Sheet, Cash Flow and Liquidity.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities (\"liquidity\") as of December 31, 2020 was $16.7 billion as a result of the following actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position during the year ended December 31, 2020:\n•\nCompleting financing transactions for an aggregate principal amount of approximately\n$25.9 billion.\n•\nReceiving $5.6 billion as part of the CARES Act payroll support program as described in \"Government Support Programs\" below.\n•\nReducing planned capital expenditures by approximately\n$2.8 billion for the year to $1.9 billion, including restructuring our aircraft order books for future aircraft deliveries, delaying aircraft modifications and postponing certain information technology initiatives and ground equipment replacement. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our aircraft purchase commitments.\n•\nAmending our credit facilities to replace fixed charge coverage ratio covenants with liquidity-based covenants.\n•\nSuspending share repurchases and dividends indefinitely and postponing voluntary pension funding.\nIn addition, in January 2021 we received $1.4 billion with respect to the payroll support program extension described below, with the remaining $1.5 billion expected in the March 2021 quarter.\nIn response to the impact that the demand environment has had on our financial condition, our credit rating was downgraded by Standard & Poor's to BB in March 2020 and by Fitch to BB+ in April 2020. Our credit rating from Moody's remains Baa3. See \"Financial Condition and Liquidity - Sources and Uses of Liquidity\" for additional information.\nOur debt agreements contain various affirmative, negative and financial covenants. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these covenants.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               31\nItem 7. MD&A - Financial Highlights\nGovernment Support Programs\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") was enacted into law. The CARES Act is a support package intended to assist many aspects of the American economy, including providing the airline industry with up to $25 billion in grants and loans to be used for employee wages, salaries and benefits.\nIn April 2020, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to receive emergency support through the CARES Act payroll support program, which totaled $5.6 billion. The support payments were conditioned on our agreement to comply with a variety of conditions, including to refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through September 30, 2020. The support payments consisted of $4.0 billion in a grant and $1.6 billion in an unsecured 10-year low interest loan. The loan bears interest at an annual rate of 1.00% for the first five years (through April 2025) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus 2.00% in the final five years. In return, we issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury warrants to acquire more than 6.7 million shares of Delta common stock, which represented approximately 1% of our outstanding shares. These warrants have an initial exercise price of $24.39 per share, subject to adjustment in certain cases, and a five-year term.\nThe relative fair value of the warrants issued in 2020 is recorded within stockholder's equity and as a discount reducing the carrying value of the loan which is being amortized as interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations (\"income statement\") over the term of the loan. The proceeds of the 2020 CARES Act grant were recorded in cash and cash equivalents when received and were recognized as contra-expense in government grant recognition in our income statement over the periods that the funds were intended to compensate. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the unsecured loan and warrants to acquire Delta shares issued under the CARES Act payroll support program.\nFinally, the CARES Act also provides for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. This provided us with approximately $200 million of additional liquidity during 2020.\nOn December 27, 2020, an additional COVID-19 support bill was enacted into law, which extends the payroll support program of the CARES Act and provides an additional $15 billion in grants and loans to be used for airline employee wages, salaries and benefits. In January 2021, we entered into a payroll support program extension agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. We expect to receive $2.9 billion in payroll support payments, which must be used exclusively for the payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits and are conditioned on our agreement to refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs from the date of the extension agreement through March 2021. Other conditions include prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through March 2022 and certain limitations on executive compensation until October 2022. The Department of Transportation also has the authority until March 1, 2022 to require airlines that received payroll support program funds to maintain scheduled air service deemed necessary to any point served by the airline before March 1, 2020.\nThe expected support payments consist of approximately\n$2.0 billion in grants and $830 million in an unsecured 10-year low interest loan. We received the first installment of $1.4 billion under the agreement on January 15, 2021 and expect to receive the balance in the March 2021 quarter. The loan bears interest at an annual rate of 1.00% for the first five years (through January 15, 2026) and the applicable SOFR plus 2.00% in the final five years. Approximately 70% of the payment received on January 15, 2021 was in the form of a grant, and approximately 30% was in the form of an unsecured loan. We issued a promissory note for approximately $400 million with respect to the term loan, which will increase to its full principal amount as the balance of payroll support payments is received. In connection with receipt of these payments, we also expect to issue to the U.S. Department of the Treasury warrants to acquire shares of Delta common stock, which we expect to be approximately 2.1 million shares representing less than 0.5% of our outstanding shares. Approximately one-half of the expected warrants were issued on January 15, 2021 and the remaining warrants will be issued as the balance of payroll support payments is received. These warrants have an initial exercise price of $39.73 per share, subject to adjustment in certain cases, and a five-year term.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               32\nItem 7. MD&A - Financial Highlights\nFinancial Highlights - 2020 Compared to 2019\nOur pre-tax loss for 2020 was $15.6 billion, representing a $21.8 billion decrease compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business which resulted in a 64% decrease in revenue and $8.2 billion of restructuring charges and $2.4 billion in investment impairments and equity method losses. Pre-tax loss, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $9.0 billion, a decrease of $15.2 billion compared to the prior year. Adjustments for 2020 were primarily related to restructuring charges from fleet retirement decisions, voluntary early retirement and separation programs charges and investment impairments and equity method losses, which were partially offset by recognition of the CARES Act grant.\nRevenue.\nCompared to 2020, our operating revenue decreased $29.9 billion, or 64% due to reduced demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Expense.\nTotal operating expense decreased $10.8 billion, or 27%, compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from lower volume and selling-related expenses including fuel, lower profit sharing, recognition of the CARES Act payroll support program grant and significant cost reduction measures taken across all aspects of our operation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by restructuring charges. Total operating expense, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) decreased $16.0 billion, or 40% compared to the prior year.\nOur total operating cost per available seat mile (\"CASM\") increased 50% to 22.01 cents compared to the prior year, primarily due to the 51% decrease in capacity, which was partially offset by the significant cost reduction measures discussed above. Non-fuel unit costs (\"CASM-Ex\", a non-GAAP financial measure) increased 43% to 15.61 cents and consolidated CASM, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure, which includes aircraft fuel costs) increased 23% to 17.96 cents.\nNon-Operating Results.\nTotal non-operating expense was $3.1 billion in 2020, $2.7 billion higher than the prior year primarily resulting from impairments and our proportionate share of equity method losses related to our investments in LATAM, Grupo Aeroméxico and Virgin Atlantic, and higher interest expense as a result of our increased debt balances due to the financing arrangements entered into during 2020.\nCash Flow.\nOur liquidity at December 31, 2020 was $16.7 billion, a $10.8 billion increase compared to December 31, 2019 as a result of proceeds from loans and debt issuances (including our SkyMiles financing arrangements and aircraft financings), support payments under the CARES Act payroll support program and other liquidity initiatives. Losses during 2020 resulted in operating activities using $3.8 billion. During 2020 we incurred $9.2 billion of investing cash outflows, primarily related to the purchase of short-term investments and our tender offer to acquire shares of LATAM in January 2020. These results generated $4.3 billion of negative free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) in 2020 compared to $4.2 billion of free cash flow in 2019.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures pre-tax loss, adjusted, operating expense, adjusted, CASM-Ex, consolidated CASM, adjusted, and free cash flow used above are defined and reconciled in \"Supplemental Information\" below.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               33\nItem 7. MD&A - Results of Operations\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenue\n(1)\nThis reconciliation may not recalculate due to rounding.\n(2)\nFor additional information on adjustments to TRASM, see \"Supplemental Information\" below.\nOperating Revenue\nCompared to the year ended December 31, 2019, our operating revenue decreased $29.9 billion, or 64%, due to reduced demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in operating revenue, on a 51% decrease in capacity, generated a 25% decrease in total revenue per available seat mile (\"TRASM\") and a 30% decrease in TRASM, adjusted compared to 2019. The increase in third-party refinery sales resulted from the refinery's shift to producing more non-jet fuel products due to the decline in demand for jet fuel. See \"Refinery Segment\" below for additional details on the refinery's operations during 2020.\nWe have historically generated cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft. In 2020, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced industry capacity drove a significant increase in our cargo yield, and we also generated cargo revenue through the operation of cargo-only charter flights (i.e., using aircraft in our fleet not then being utilized for passenger travel). These two factors contributed to the smaller percentage decline in cargo revenue, than in passenger revenue, compared to the prior year.\nThe length and severity of the reduction in travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain, as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors, but we currently expect three phases in 2021. We anticipate that the early part of the year will be characterized by fluctuating demand. With continued distribution of effective vaccines and easing of travel advisories and restrictions, we believe customer confidence will grow, leading to increased demand in the spring and summer of 2021. We expect vaccination to become widespread during the second half of 2021, resulting in sustained demand improvement.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               34\nItem 7. MD&A - Results of Operations\nPassenger Revenue by Geographic Region\nPassenger revenue decreased $29.4 billion, or 70%, compared to the prior year. PRASM decreased 38% and passenger mile yield decreased 1% on 51% lower capacity. Load factor decreased 32 pts from the prior year to 55%.\nWe began waiving changes fees on most tickets during 2020 and subsequently changed our policy with respect to change fees, as described above in \"Taking Care of our Customers and Employees.\" We do not expect these policy changes to materially affect our revenue in future periods.\nDomestic\nPrior to the initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, domestic results were strong with revenue nearly 10% higher than the prior year period. However, due to the decrease in customer demand beginning in March, passenger unit revenue related to our domestic region decreased 42% with capacity down 43% compared to the prior year. We are planning for improvement to the demand environment, primarily from leisure customers, to continue in 2021, though still significantly lower than the comparable period in 2019. We remain optimistic about the ultimate recovery of business travel, but are unable to predict the timing or extent of that recovery.\nInternational\nPassenger revenue related to our international regions decreased 76% compared to the prior year. The reductions in revenue and capacity presented in the table above were a result of reduced demand and government travel directives and quarantines limiting or suspending air travel due to the global spread of COVID-19. Additionally, many countries have implemented international testing requirements, which has slowed demand in the short-term but is expected to enhance the long-term recovery of international air travel. We expect this significantly lower demand environment to continue into 2021, with improvement expected after the recovery in domestic travel. As an initial step to this recovery, in December 2020 we became the first U.S. airline to offer flights between the U.S. and Europe that allow customers to avoid quarantine upon arrival after testing negative for the virus prior to travel and upon arrival in Amsterdam and Rome. During 2020 we transferred our U.S.-Tokyo services from Narita to Haneda airport, Tokyo's preferred airport for corporate customers, and continued to develop our network connectivity with our joint venture partner Korean Air at Seoul-Incheon airport. In each of the international regions we continue to monitor government travel directives and customer demand and will adjust flight schedules accordingly.\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we completed two transactions to further strengthen our international partnerships. In the Atlantic region, effective January 2020, we combined our separate transatlantic joint venture agreements with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic into a single three-party transatlantic joint venture. This enhanced joint venture is designed to strengthen collaboration between the three airlines and is expected to provide customers with increased access to destinations across North America, the U.K. and Europe.\nIn the Latin America region, in January 2020, we completed the tender offer to acquire 20% of the shares of LATAM as part of our plan to create a strategic alliance. Additionally, in the March 2020 quarter, we started codesharing for certain flights operated by LATAM. In May 2020, we signed a trans-American joint venture agreement with LATAM that, subject to regulatory approvals, will combine our highly complementary route networks between North and South America, with the goal of providing customers with a seamless travel experience and industry-leading connectivity. We believe this alliance will generate growth opportunities, building upon Delta's and LATAM's global footprint and joint ventures. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our strategic alliance with LATAM and the impact of its bankruptcy filing.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               35\nItem 7. MD&A - Results of Operations\nOther Revenue\nAncillary Businesses and Refinery.\nAncillary businesses and refinery includes refinery sales to third parties, aircraft maintenance provided to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations. Refinery sales to third parties, which are at or near cost, increased $1.1 billion compared to 2019. The increase in third-party refinery sales resulted from the refinery's shift to producing more non-jet fuel products due to the decline in demand for jet fuel. The increase in refinery sales was partially offset by an approximately $270 million, or approximately 30%, decline in revenue from aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties, which decreased due to the reduction in flights operated worldwide. In addition, results for 2019 also included approximately $200 million of revenue from Delta Private Jets, which was combined with Wheels Up in January 2020 and is no longer reflected in ancillary businesses and refinery.\nLoyalty Program.\nLoyalty program revenues relate primarily to brand usage by third parties and other performance obligations embedded in miles sold, including redemption of miles for non-travel awards. These revenues are mainly driven by customer spend on American Express cards, which declined at a lower rate than air travel, during the year.\nMiscellaneous.\nMiscellaneous revenue is primarily composed of lounge access and codeshare revenues. The volume of these transactions has fallen compared to 2019, due to the impact of, and our response to, the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               36\nItem 7. MD&A - Results of Operations\nOperating Expense\nAs discussed above under \"Expense Management,\" in response to the reduced demand and related reduction in revenue following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we quickly reduced capacity to more closely align with demand and implemented cost saving initiatives related to our fleet and operations and delayed or eliminated nearly all discretionary spending.\nAs a result, most operating expense line items decreased significantly in 2020 compared to 2019. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to the voluntary separation programs and work hour reductions described below, the many cost reduction measures and programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the reduction in volume and selling-related costs. During 2021, as effective vaccines become broadly available, vaccination becomes widespread globally, travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease and customer confidence begins to grow, we expect operating expense to increase as capacity and revenue return. However, we believe that many of the cost savings achieved during 2020 were structural in nature, which we expect to lead to lower non-fuel unit cost in the future.\nThe discussion below is focused largely on the year-over-year changes in certain operating expense line items that were not primarily driven by the reduction in capacity or revenue. These include many of the cost reduction measures and programs we implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSalaries and Related Costs.\nThe decrease in salaries and related costs is primarily due to actions taken in response to the decreased demand for air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in March 2020 and continuing through December 2020, we reduced salaries by 100% for our CEO and 50% for our officers. In addition, we reduced work hours by 25% for all other management and most front-line employee work groups. We offered voluntary unpaid leaves of absence for periods ranging from 30 days up to 12 months and approximately 50,000 of our employees elected a leave at various times throughout 2020. Also, during the September 2020 quarter, approximately 18,000 employees elected to participate in voluntary separation programs, reducing our workforce by approximately 20%. We expect the lower headcount following these voluntary separation programs to mitigate the impact on salaries and related costs from the restoration of salaries and work hours in 2021, enabling us to maintain lower costs compared to 2019.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               37\nItem 7. MD&A - Results of Operations\nAircraft Fuel and Related Taxes.\nFuel expense decreased $5.3 billion compared to the prior year due to a 51% decrease in capacity and an approximately 25% decrease in the market price per gallon of jet fuel.\nThe table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon, adjusted (non-GAAP financial measures):\n(1)\nThis reconciliation may not calculate exactly due to rounding.\n(2)\nMarket price for jet fuel at airport locations, including related taxes and transportation costs.\n(3)\nRefer to \"Refinery Segment\" below for additional information about our refinery's operations.\n(4)\nMTM adjustments and settlements on hedges include the effects of the derivative transactions disclosed in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information and the reason for adjusting fuel expense, see \"Supplemental Information\" below.\n(5)\nBecause we combined Delta Private Jets with Wheels Up in January 2020, we have excluded the impact of Delta Private Jets from 2019 results for comparability.\nDepreciation and Amortization.\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to aircraft that have been retired or impaired during 2020, including the MD-88, MD-90, 717, 737-700, 767-300ER and 777 fleet types, as well as certain A320 aircraft. Impairments and other charges related to the retirement of these fleets are reflected in restructuring charges. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these fleet retirements.\nAncillary Businesses and Refinery.\nAncillary businesses and refinery includes expenses associated with refinery sales to third parties, aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations. Increased expenses were primarily related to refinery sales to third parties, which are at or near cost. These refinery cost of sales increased $1.1 billion compared to 2019. Due to the decrease in demand for jet fuel following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the refinery shifted production to more non-jet fuel products, which increased the sales to third parties during 2020 compared to the prior year period. The increase in refinery costs was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $260 million in the cost of aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties compared to 2019 due to the reduction in flights operated worldwide. In addition, approximately $180 million of costs related to services performed by Delta Private Jets in 2019 were recorded in ancillary businesses and refinery prior to the combination of that business with Wheels Up in January 2020.\nAircraft Rent.\nMost aircraft operating lease expenses are recorded in aircraft rent and are contractually fixed. Therefore, aircraft rent did not decline to the same extent as our other operating expense line items compared to 2019.\nRestructuring Charges.\nRestructuring charges are composed of various expenses that resulted from our response to the unprecedented impact on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic primarily due to fleet impairment and related charges and voluntary separation program charges. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these restructuring charges.\nGovernment Grant Recognition.\nIn April 2020, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to receive emergency support through the CARES Act payroll support program, which totaled $5.6 billion. The support payments included a grant of $4.0 billion that was fully recognized as a contra-expense in 2020 over the period that the funds were intended to benefit. We expect to receive approximately $2.9 billion in the March 2021 quarter as part of the payroll support program extension, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be in the form of grants that we plan to recognize as contra-expense during the first half of 2021. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about government support programs, including the CARES Act.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               38\nItem 7. MD&A - Non-Operating Results\nNon-Operating Results\nInterest expense, net.\nInterest expense increased compared to 2019 as a result of the financing arrangements entered into during 2020. See Note 2 and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on recent financings. As a result of the increase in our outstanding debt since the onset of the pandemic, we expect to incur approximately $350 million in quarterly interest expense at the beginning of 2021. However, we expect to reduce those expenses during 2021 by paying down our debt in addition to scheduled maturities.\nImpairments and equity method losses.\nImpairments and equity method losses reflects our share of LATAM and Grupo Aeroméxico's equity method results prior to their respective bankruptcy filings, our share of Virgin Atlantic's equity method results and the impairments reducing the carrying value of these investments to zero during the June 2020 quarter. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our equity investments.\nGain/(loss) on investments, net.\nGain/(loss) on investments, net reflects the gains and losses on our equity investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our equity investments.\nMiscellaneous, net.\nMiscellaneous, net includes pension and related expense, foreign exchange gains/losses, charitable contributions and gains and losses resulting from other transactions. Foreign exchange gains/losses vary and impact the comparability of miscellaneous, net from period to period. The increase in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the $240 million gain recognized as a result of the combination of Delta Private Jets with Wheels Up in January 2020 and favorable movement in pension and related expense in 2020 compared to 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for 2020 was 21%. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $5.7 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards, of which $2.0 billion was generated prior to 2018 and will not begin to expire until\n2027, and under current tax law, the remaining amount has no expiration.\nFor more information about our income taxes, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               39\nItem 7. MD&A - Refinery Segment\nRefinery Segment\nThe refinery operated by our subsidiary Monroe Energy, LLC and MIPC, LLC (collectively, \"Monroe\") primarily produces gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Monroe has agreements in place to exchange the non-jet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations. Historically, the jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provided approximately 200,000 barrels per day, or approximately 75% of our pre-COVID-19 pandemic consumption, for use in our airline operations. We believe that the jet fuel supply resulting from the refinery's operation generally contributes to reducing the market price of jet fuel and lowers our cost of jet fuel compared to what it otherwise would be.\nThe refinery’s production has also been altered by the dramatic change in economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2020, the refinery operated at 60% – 90% of normal production levels, largely due to the significant decrease in the demand for jet fuel. Additionally, due to the decrease in demand for jet fuel, the refinery has shifted production to produce more non-jet fuel products. Those non-jet fuel products will continue to be exchanged for jet fuel to the extent that the refinery can balance refinery sales with jet fuel demand.\nThe refinery recorded operating revenues of $3.1 billion in 2020, compared to $5.6 billion in 2019. As a result of the refinery's shift to producing more non-jet fuel products, operating revenues in 2020 were composed of $1.5 billion of non-jet fuel products exchanged with third parties to procure jet fuel, $1.1 billion of refinery sales to third parties, $307 million of non-jet fuel product sales and $214 million of sales of jet fuel to the airline segment. Refinery revenues decreased compared to the prior year periods due to lower refinery run rates during the year, as well as lower pricing for refined products.\nThe refinery recorded an operating loss of $216 million in 2020, compared to operating income of $76 million in 2019. The operating loss in 2020 compared to income in 2019 was mainly driven by an increase in RINs compliance costs discussed below and the reduction in revenue, which was partially offset by cost savings resulting from decreased production levels.\nA refinery is subject to annual EPA requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and on-road diesel fuel it produces. Alternatively, a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits, called RINs, from third parties in the secondary market. The refinery operated by Monroe purchases the majority of its RINs requirement in the secondary market. Observable RINs prices increased throughout 2020, with Monroe incurring\n$172 million\nin RINs compliance costs during 2020 as compared to $58 million in 2019.\nFor more information regarding the refinery's results, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating Statistics\n(1)\nIncludes the operations of our regional carriers under capacity purchase agreements. Full-time equivalent employees exclude employees of regional carriers that we do not own.\n(2)\nIncludes the impact of fuel hedge activity and refinery segment results.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               40\nItem 7. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position, which included the following during 2020. We are continuing to monitor and carefully manage our liquidity.\n•\nCompleting financing transactions for an aggregate principal amount of approximately\n$25.9 billion, which are discussed in \"Financing Activities\" below.\n•\nReceiving $5.6 billion as part of the CARES Act payroll support program as described in \"Government Support Programs\" above.\n•\nReducing planned capital expenditures by approximately\n$2.8 billion for the year to $1.9 billion, including restructuring our aircraft order books for future aircraft deliveries, delaying aircraft modifications and postponing certain information technology initiatives and ground equipment replacement. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our aircraft purchase commitments.\n•\nAmending our credit facilities to replace fixed charge coverage ratio covenants with liquidity-based covenants.\n•\nSuspending share repurchases and dividends indefinitely and postponing voluntary pension funding.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $16.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, in January 2021 we received $1.4 billion with respect to the payroll support program extension described below, with the remaining $1.5 billion expected in the March 2021 quarter.\nWe expect to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, financing arrangements, government assistance under the payroll support program, restricted cash equivalents and cash flows from operations. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements.\nWe have unencumbered assets available for potential financing arrangements, if needed. During 2020, we used existing cash and cash received from financings to fund capital expenditures of $1.9 billion, of which the largest portion was incurred before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to return $604 million to shareholders also before the onset of the global pandemic. Capital expenditures in 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic were limited to only those critical to our operation.\nThe following discussion of liquidity evaluates various material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations, but does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time, including legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements, among others. The amounts presented are based on various estimates, including estimates regarding the timing of payments, prevailing interest rates, volumes purchased, the occurrence of certain events and other factors. Accordingly, the actual results may vary materially from the amounts discussed herein.\nSources and Uses of Liquidity\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities in 2020 used\n$3.8 billion compared to providing $8.4 billion in 2019. Including the $2.9 billion in payroll support payments we expect to receive during the March 2021 quarter, if the demand environment evolves as described above we expect to generate positive cash flows from operations during 2021. As described above, we are planning for demand recovery throughout much of 2021, with sustained demand improvement expected during the second half of 2021.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               41\nItem 7. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity\nOur operating cash flows are impacted by the following factors:\nSeasonality of Advance Ticket Sales\n. We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date. When we receive a cash payment at the time of sale, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability. The air traffic liability has historically increased during the winter and spring as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreased during the summer and fall months. However, the ongoing reduction in demand for air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented low level of advance bookings and the associated cash received, as well as significant ticket cancellations which led to issuance of cash refunds or travel credits to customers. The total value of cash refunds, excluding taxes and related fees, issued to customers during 2020 was approximately $3.1 billion. Travel credits represented approximately 65% of the air traffic liability as of December 31, 2020.\nThe length and severity of the reduction in travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain, as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors, but we currently expect three phases in 2021. We anticipate that the early part of the year will be characterized by fluctuating demand. With continued distribution of effective vaccines and easing of travel advisories and restrictions, we believe customer confidence will grow, leading to increased demand in the spring and summer of 2021. We expect vaccination to become widespread during the second half of 2021, resulting in sustained demand improvement.\nFuel\n. Fuel expense represented approximately 11% of our total operating expense for 2020. The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations. We expect fuel consumption to be lower through the March 2021 quarter than the comparable quarter in 2020, as only the final weeks of the March 2020 quarter were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the remainder of 2021, as effective vaccines become broadly available, vaccination becomes widespread globally, travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease and customer confidence begins to grow, we expect capacity to return and fuel consumption to increase compared to the comparable period of 2020, though we still expect it to be lower than the comparable period in 2019.\nEmployee Benefit Obligations.\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. These plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals. Our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as modified by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We had no minimum funding requirements in 2019 or 2020, we have no such requirements in 2021, and based on our current projections, we do not expect any minimum required contributions until 2025. However, during 2019, we voluntarily contributed $1 billion to these plans. As a part of our liquidity initiatives we suspended voluntary pension funding that we were previously planning in 2020. We plan to contribute at least $500 million to these plans in 2021.\nIn addition, we have employee benefit obligations relating primarily to projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our employee benefit obligations.\nVoluntary Separation Programs.\nIn 2020, we recorded a $3.4 billion\ncharge associated with voluntary early retirement and separation programs and other employee benefit charges. Approximately $720 million of this charge was disbursed in cash payments to participants during 2020. An additional approximately $250 million of cash payments were disbursed in 2020 related to unused vacation and other benefits, which were accrued prior to the voluntary programs charge. We anticipate that approximately $600 million in cash payments will be made to participants in the voluntary separation programs in 2021 and the remaining payments in 2022 and beyond.\nProfit Sharing.\nOur broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees. We paid $1.6 billion in profit sharing in February 2020 related to our 2019 pre-tax profit in recognition of our employees' contributions toward meeting our financial goals. We will not have a profit sharing payment in 2021 based on the pre-tax loss in 2020.\nGovernment Support Programs.\nSee \"Financing Activities\" below for discussion of the impact to our liquidity from the government support programs in 2020 and 2021.\nContract Carrier Obligations.\nWe have certain estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These minimum amounts are based on the required minimum levels of flying by the regional carriers under the respective agreements and assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying. As of December 31, 2020 the total of these minimum amounts was $7.7 billion, which range from approximately $800 million to $1.4 billion on an annual basis over the next five years. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our contract carrier obligations.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               42\nItem 7. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity\nOperating Lease Obligations.\nAs described further in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2020 we had a total of $8.6 billion of minimum operating lease obligations. These minimum lease payments range from approximately $700 million to $900 million on an annual basis over the next five years.\nOther Obligations.\nWe have certain purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including, but not limited to, aviation-related, maintenance, professional security, insurance, marketing, technology, sponsorships and other third-party services and products. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $8.0 billion of such obligations, which range from approximately $400 million to $900 million on an annual basis over the next five years.\nInvesting Activities\nShort-Term Investments.\nUsing a portion of the proceeds we obtained through our financing transactions discussed below, in 2020 we acquired a net of $5.8 billion in short-term investments. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these investments.\nCapital Expenditures.\nOur capital expenditures are primarily related to the purchase of aircraft, fleet modifications and technology enhancements. Our capital expenditures were $1.9 billion in 2020, of which the largest portion was incurred before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and $4.9 billion in 2019.\nIn 2020, we restructured our aircraft order books with Airbus and MHI RJ Aviation Group (manufacturer of CRJ aircraft) in an effort to better match the timing of aircraft deliveries with our network and financial needs over the next several years. The restructuring reduced our aircraft purchase commitments by more than $2 billion in 2020 and by more than $5 billion through 2022. The shift in delivery timing is intended to allow us to continue simplifying and modernizing our fleet while maintaining our Airbus order book.\nWe expect that we will have capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion in 2021 primarily for aircraft, including deliveries and advance deposit payments, as well as aircraft modifications, the majority of which relate to cabin improvements and technology enhancements. We expect that the capital expenditures in 2021 will be funded through either cash flows from operations or financing arrangements. We have committed to future aircraft purchases and have obtained, but are under no obligation to use, long-term financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of the aircraft. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our aircraft purchase commitments.\nIn connection with a dispute brought at the World Trade Organization against the EU and certain member states to address state subsidies in the large civil aircraft sector, the U.S. Trade Representative has imposed tariffs on certain products imported from the EU, including 15% tariffs on certain new aircraft and certain airplane parts originating in France and Germany. We are pursuing strategies to minimize the impact, if any, of these tariffs on our business.\nEquity Investments.\nIn January 2020, we acquired 20% of the shares of LATAM for $1.9 billion, or $16 per share, through a tender offer. In addition, to support the establishment of our strategic alliance, we agreed to make transition payments to LATAM totaling $350 million, of which $75 million remains to be paid by the end of 2021.\nAs part of our planned strategic alliance with LATAM, we have also assumed 10 of LATAM's A350 purchase commitments with Airbus for deliveries through 2025. We believe this alliance will generate growth opportunities, building upon Delta's and LATAM's global footprint and joint ventures.\nDuring 2020, we acquired through open market transactions, additional outstanding shares of Hanjin-KAL, the largest shareholder of Korean Air, for $158 million. As of December 31, 2020 our equity ownership interest in Hanjin-KAL was approximately 13%.\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our equity investments.\nLos Angeles International Airport (\"LAX\") Construction.\nWe executed a modified lease agreement during 2016 with the City of Los Angeles (the \"City\"), which owns and operates LAX, and announced plans to modernize, upgrade and\nprovide post-security connection to Terminals 2 and 3. Construction is underway, which includes a new centralized ticketing and arrival hall, a new security checkpoint, core infrastructure to support the City's planned airport people mover, ramp improvements and a post-security connector to the north side of the Tom Bradley International Terminal.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               43\nItem 7. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity\nGiven reduced passenger volumes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have accelerated the construction schedule for this project. Additionally, in 2020, we enhanced the project’s scope to include a more customer-friendly design of Terminal 3, a Delta One lounge and expanded Delta Sky Club, and baggage system upgrades designed to increase the terminals’ operational efficiency going forward. Construction is expected to be completed by 2023.\nThe project is expected to cost approximately $2.3 billion. A substantial majority of the project costs are being funded through the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation (\"RAIC\"), a California public benefit corporation, using an $800 million revolving credit facility provided by a group of lenders. The credit facility was executed during 2017 and amended in 2020, and we have guaranteed the obligations of the RAIC under the credit facility. Loans made under the credit facility are being repaid with the proceeds from the City’s purchase of completed project assets. Under the lease agreement and subsequent project component approvals by the City's Board of Airport Commissioners, the City has appropriated to date approximately $1.8 billion to purchase completed project assets, representing the maximum allowable reimbursement by the City. Costs incurred in excess of the $1.8 billion maximum will not be reimbursed by the City. We currently expect our net project costs to be approximately $500 million, of which approximately $200 million has been reflected as investing activities in our cash flows statement since the project started in 2017.\nIn 2020, $315 million was spent on this project, with $293 million paid by the credit facility and $22 million paid directly by Delta. Approximately $550 million is expected to be spent on the project during 2021, with $445 million to be paid by the credit facility and $105 million to be paid directly by Delta.\nNew York-LaGuardia Redevelopment.\nAs part of the terminal redevelopment project at LaGuardia Airport, we are partnering with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (\"Port Authority\") to replace Terminals C and D with a new state-of-the-art terminal facility consisting of 37 gates across 4 concourses connected to a central headhouse. The terminal will feature a new, larger Delta Sky Club, wider concourses, more gate seating and 75% more concessions space than the existing terminals. The facility will also offer direct access between the parking garage and terminal and improved roadways and drop-off/pick-up areas. The design of the new terminal will integrate sustainable technologies and improvements in energy efficiency. Construction will be phased to limit passenger inconvenience and is expected to be completed by 2026.\nIn connection with the redevelopment, during 2017, we entered into an amended and restated terminal lease with the Port Authority with a term through 2050. Pursuant to the lease agreement, as amended to date, we will (1) fund (through debt issuance and existing cash) and undertake the design, management and construction of the terminal and certain off-premises supporting facilities, (2) receive a Port Authority contribution of $481 million to facilitate construction of the terminal and other supporting infrastructure, (3) be responsible for all operations and maintenance during the term of the lease and (4) have preferential rights to all gates in the terminal subject to Port Authority requirements with respect to accommodation of designated carriers. We currently expect our net project cost to be approximately $3.5 billion and we bear the risks of project construction, including any potential cost over-runs. Using funding primarily provided by existing financing arrangements, we spent approximately $600 million during 2020, bringing the total amount spent on the project to date to approximately $1.5 billion. We expect to spend approximately $900 million\nduring 2021, of which a substantial majority will be paid using cash restricted for airport construction. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the debt related to this redevelopment project, the New York Transportation Development Corporation (\"NYTDC\") Special Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2018 and NYTDC Special Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2020.\nIn 2019, we opened Concourse G, the first of the four new concourses housing seven of the 37 new gates. Not only did it deliver the first direct impact to the Delta passenger experience, it also represented the first major phasing milestone. The next major milestone will be the opening of the headhouse and Concourse E, which is scheduled for 2022.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               44\nItem 7. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity\nFinancing Activities\nDebt and Finance Leases.\nDuring 2020, we took quick and decisive action to mitigate liquidity risk following the onset of the global pandemic by obtaining approximately $25.9 billion from financing transactions. A summary of these transactions is listed below. As our liquidity position began to stabilize during 2020, we repaid approximately $5.6 billion of future debt maturities, including $2.6 billion under our revolving credit facilities which had been drawn down in March 2020. See Note 2, Note 8 and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nRaising $9.0 billion through the issuance of notes and entry into a term loan facility, each secured by certain assets related to our SkyMiles program.\n•\nIssuing $3.5 billion of senior secured notes and entering into a $1.5 billion term loan, both of which are secured by certain slots, gates and routes.\n•\nEntering into a $3.0 billion 364-day secured term loan facility with an original maturity in March 2021, which was repaid early and terminated in October 2020.\n•\nEntering into $2.8 billion of sale-leaseback transactions. Approximately $2.3 billion of these transactions were treated as financing activities with the remainder treated as investing activities. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nEntering into a promissory note for the $1.6 billion CARES Act payroll support program loan.\n•\nEntering into loan agreements to borrow $1.5 billion from the NYTDC in connection with NYTDC's issuance of Special Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2020, to finance, among other things, a portion of the construction costs for the new terminal facilities at LaGuardia Airport.\n•\nCompleting $1.7 billion in transactions secured by aircraft, including EETC issuances and aircraft loans.\n•\nIssuing $1.3 billion of unsecured notes.\nIn addition, in January 2021 we received $1.4 billion with respect to the payroll support program extension described below, with the remaining $1.5 billion expected in the March 2021 quarter.\nThe principal amount of our debt and finance leases was $29.4 billion at December 31, 2020.\nFuture Debt Obligations.\nAs described further in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2020, scheduled maturities of our debt in 2021 and 2022 were $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, with maturities from 2023 through 2025 ranging between $3 billion and $5 billion annually. As of December 31, 2020, scheduled maturities after 2025 aggregate to $12.5 billion. In addition, we are obligated to make periodic interest payments at fixed and variable rates, depending on the terms of the applicable debt agreements. Based on applicable interest rates and scheduled debt maturities as of December 31, 2020, these interest obligations total approximately $7.2 billion and range from approximately $700 million to $1.4 billion on an annual basis over the next five years. In addition to payment of scheduled debt maturities, we expect to pay down our debt in 2021, and therefore reduce our future interest obligations.\nOur current ratings from the three major credit rating agencies are summarized in the table below:\nFinance Lease Obligations.\nAs described further in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020 we had a total of $1.3 billion of minimum finance lease obligations. These minimum lease payments range from approximately $100 million to $300 million on an annual basis over the next five years.\nCapital Returns to Shareholders.\nIn early March 2020, we suspended both our share repurchase program and future dividends due to the impact of the pandemic. Prior to suspending these activities, in the March 2020 quarter, we repurchased and retired 6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $344 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $260 million. The CARES Act payroll support program initially restricted share repurchases and the payment of dividends through September 2021, which have been continued to March 2022 under the terms of the payroll support extension.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               45\nItem 7. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity\nUndrawn Lines of Credit.\nAs of December 31, 2020 we had approximately $2.6 billion undrawn and available under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, we had outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2020, including approximately\n$300 million that reduced the availability under our revolvers and approximately $300 million that did not affect the availability under our revolvers.\nCovenants.\nWe were in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements at December 31, 2020. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the covenants in our debt agreements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Accordingly, the actual results may differ materially from these estimates. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, unless otherwise noted below.\nLoyalty Program\nOur SkyMiles loyalty program generates customer loyalty by rewarding customers with incentives to travel on Delta. This program allows customers to earn mileage credits (\"miles\") by flying on Delta, Delta Connection and other airlines that participate in the loyalty program. When traveling, customers earn miles based on the passenger's loyalty program status and ticket price. Customers can also earn miles through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies and ridesharing companies. Miles are redeemable by customers in future periods for air travel on Delta and other participating airlines, membership in our Sky Club and other program awards. To facilitate transactions with participating companies, we sell miles to non-airline businesses, customers and other airlines.\nThe loyalty program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations (1) passenger ticket sales earning miles and (2) sale of miles to participating companies.\nPassenger Ticket Sales Earning Miles.\nPassenger ticket sales earning miles provide customers with (1) miles earned and (2) air transportation, which are each considered performance obligations. We value each performance obligation on a standalone basis. To value the miles earned, we consider the quantitative value a passenger receives by redeeming miles for a ticket rather than paying cash, which is referred to as equivalent ticket value (\"ETV\"). Our estimate of ETV is adjusted for miles that are not likely to be redeemed (\"breakage\"). We use statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions to the redemption activity for miles or the estimated fair value of miles expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. We recognize breakage proportionally during the period in which the remaining miles are actually redeemed.\nAt December 31, 2020, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the SkyMiles program was $7.2 billion. A hypothetical 10% change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in an impact of approximately $60 million on annual revenue recognized.\nWe defer revenue for the miles when earned and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. We record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize passenger revenue when we provide transportation or if the ticket goes unused. A hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of the ETV of a mile would decrease annual passenger revenue by approximately $40 million, as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales.\nSale of Miles to Participating Companies.\nCustomers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies and ridesharing companies with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles. Our contracts to sell miles under these marketing agreements have multiple performance obligations. Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period, and the initial terms of our marketing contracts are from three to eleven years. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, total cash sales from marketing agreements were $2.8 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations, as discussed below.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               46\nItem 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates\nOur most significant contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. Our agreements with American Express provide for joint marketing, grant certain benefits to Delta-American Express co-branded credit card holders (\"cardholders\") and American Express Membership Rewards program participants, and allow American Express to market its services or products using our customer database. Cardholders earn miles for making purchases using co-branded cards, and certain cardholders may also check their first bag for free, are granted discounted access to Delta Sky Club lounges and receive priority boarding and other benefits while traveling on Delta. Additionally, participants in the American Express Membership Rewards program may exchange their points for miles under the loyalty program. We sell miles at agreed-upon rates to American Express which are then provided to their customers under the co-brand credit card program and the Membership Rewards program. Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our co-brand and other agreements with American Express which increased the value we receive and extended the terms to 2029. The products and services delivered are consistent with previous agreements.\nWe account for marketing agreements, including those with American Express, by allocating the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered. We allocate the value based on the relative selling prices of those products and services, which generally consist of award travel, priority boarding, baggage fee waivers, lounge access and the use of our brand. We determine our best estimate of the selling prices by using a discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) ETV for the award travel obligation adjusted for breakage, (3) published rates on our website for baggage fees, discounted access to Delta Sky Club lounges and other benefits while traveling on Delta, (4) brand value (using estimated royalties generated from the use of our brand) and (5) volume discounts provided to certain partners.\nWe defer the amount allocated to award travel as part of loyalty program deferred revenue and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. Revenue allocated to services performed in conjunction with a passenger’s flight, such as baggage fee waivers, is recognized as travel-related services in passenger revenue when the related service is performed. Revenue allocated to access Delta Sky Club lounges is recognized as miscellaneous in other revenue as access is provided. Revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations, primarily brand value, is recorded as loyalty program in other revenue as miles are delivered.\nFor additional information on our significant accounting policies related to the loyalty program, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe apply a fair value-based impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis (as of October 1) and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. We assess the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under a qualitative approach, we consider various market factors, including certain of the key assumptions listed below. We analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the asset's fair value and the amount of the impairment. Under a quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset incorporating the key assumptions listed below into our calculation.\nWhen we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both comparable public company multiples (a market approach) and projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach). When we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market transactions, where available, (2) the royalty method for the Delta tradename (which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename) or (3) projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach).\nKey Assumptions.\nThe key assumptions in our impairment tests include (1) forecasted revenues, expenses and cash flows, including the duration and extent of impact to our business and our alliance partners from the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) current discount rates, (3) observable market transactions and (4) anticipated changes to the regulatory environment (e.g., diminished slot access, additional Open Skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals). These assumptions are consistent with those that hypothetical market participants would use. Because we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates. In addition, when performing a qualitative valuation, we consider the amount by which the intangible assets' fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               47\nItem 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates\nChanges in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinite-lived to definite-lived. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs (primarily related to fuel and employees), (3) lower passenger demand as a result of weakened U.S. and global economies, global pandemics or other factors, (4) interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike, terrorist attack or other reasons, (5) changes to the regulatory environment (e.g., diminished slot access, additional Open Skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals), (6) competitive changes by other airlines and (7) strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets.\nGoodwill\n. Our goodwill balance, which is related to the airline segment, was $9.8 billion at December 31, 2020. Based upon our quantitative assessment of all relevant factors, including applicable factors noted in \"Key Assumptions\" above in addition to the change in our market capitalization during the current year, we determined that the fair value of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, there was no indication that goodwill was impaired.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets.\nOur identifiable intangible assets, which are related to the airline segment, had a net carrying amount of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2020, of which $5.9 billion related to indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist of routes, slots, the Delta tradename and assets related to alliances and collaborative arrangements. Definite-lived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements.\nIn 2020, we performed quantitative assessments of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including applicable factors noted in \"Key Assumptions\" above, and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired as the fair value of each asset exceeded its carrying value by at least 10%. Assumptions are sensitive to uncertainty about future events, the macroeconomic environment and other market-based risk factors. A change in key assumptions such as the discount rate or projected future revenues, expenses and cash flows could materially affect the determination of fair values. However, we believe the impact of the pandemic is temporary in nature and does not materially impact the long-range forecasts for our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles. Management evaluated estimates and assumptions used in the valuations, considering market and industry-specific conditions.\nFor additional information on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets' significant accounting policies and the related fair values and book values, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nOur flight equipment, which consists of aircraft and associated engines and parts, and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $26.5 billion at December 31, 2020. This value is based on various factors, including the assets' estimated useful lives and salvage values. We review flight equipment and other long-lived assets used in operations for impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. Factors which could be indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to (1) a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, (2) significant changes in the estimated useful life, (3) significant changes in projected cash flows, (4) permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and (5) changes to the regulatory environment. For long-lived assets held for sale, we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell.\nTo determine whether impairments exist for active and temporarily parked aircraft, we group assets at the fleet type level or at the contract level for aircraft operated by third-party regional carriers (i.e., the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel and labor costs and other relevant factors. Given the substantial reduction in our active aircraft and diminished projections of future cash flows in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated our fleet during 2020 and determined that only the fleet types discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements were impaired, as the future cash flows from the operation of all other fleet types through the respective retirement dates exceeded the carrying value. As we obtain greater clarity about the duration and extent of reduced demand and potentially execute further capacity adjustments, we will continue to evaluate our fleet compared to network requirements and may decide to retire additional aircraft. Future decisions regarding the temporarily parked aircraft and the timing of any return to service will be dependent on the evolution of the demand environment.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               48\nItem 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our response, we have removed certain aircraft from active service as of December 31, 2020, which includes owned and leased aircraft that are being retired early. This resulted in impairment and other related charges of $4.4 billion, recorded in restructuring charges in our income statement. These charges were calculated using Level 3 fair value inputs based primarily upon recent market transactions and third-party bids, which were corroborated with published pricing guides and our assessment of existing market conditions based on industry knowledge. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 created additional estimation uncertainty as there is currently a limited market for aircraft and limited data on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the fair value of aircraft. Following the impairment charges, the remaining aggregate net book value of these aircraft as of December 31, 2020 is approximately $500 million. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding these impairments and related charges.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowance\nWe periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets. We establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results and tax planning strategies.\nIn evaluating the likelihood of utilizing our net deferred income tax assets, the significant factors that we consider include (1) our recent history of profitability, (2) growth in the U.S. and global economies, (3) forecast of airline revenue trends, (4) estimate of future fuel prices and (5) future impact of taxable temporary differences.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2020\nour net deferred tax asset balance was\n$2.0 billion\n, including a\n$460 million\nvaluation allowance primarily related to capital loss carryforwards and state net operating losses. Although we are in a three year cumulative loss position as of\nDecember 31, 2020\n, we have a recent history of significant earnings prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to return to profitability as the effects of the pandemic subside and to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards before any expire. Our federal net operating loss carryforwards generated before 2018 do not begin to expire until 2027. Under current tax law, federal net operating losses generated in 2020 do not expire. Therefore, we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets other than the capital loss carryforwards and state net operating losses that have short expiration periods.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. These plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. As of December 31, 2020, the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our balance sheet was $6.1 billion. We had no minimum funding requirements in 2019 or 2020, we have no such requirements in 2021, and based on our current projections, we do not expect any minimum required contributions until 2025. However, during 2019, we voluntarily contributed $1 billion to these plans. As a part of our liquidity initiatives we suspended voluntary pension funding that we were previously planning in 2020. We plan to contribute at least $500 million to these plans in 2021. The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy.\nWeighted Average Discount Rate.\nWe determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high-quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. We used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 2.62% and 3.40% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 3.40% to 4.33%.\nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return.\nOur expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data. Modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets. We review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually. Our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a long-term return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan. This is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity, fixed income, real assets, hedge funds and other assets and instruments. Our weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets for net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 8.97%.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               49\nItem 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe impact of a 0.50% change in these assumptions is shown in the table below:\nLife Expectancy\n. Changes in life expectancy may significantly impact our benefit obligations and future net periodic benefit cost. We use the Society of Actuaries (\"SOA\") published mortality data and other publicly available information to develop our best estimate of life expectancy. The SOA publishes updated mortality tables for U.S. plans and updated improvement scales. Each year we consider updates by the SOA in setting our mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations.\nFunding.\nOur funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules (\"Alternative Funding Rules\") for defined benefit plans that are frozen. We elected the Alternative Funding Rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17-year period and is calculated using an 8.85% discount rate until the 17-year period expires for all frozen defined benefit plans by the end of 2024.\nWhile the Pension Protection Act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements. Estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements. Assumptions include, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of assets, statutory requirements and demographic data for participants.\nInvestments Valued at Net Asset Value (\"NAV\") Per Share.\nOn an annual basis we assess the potential for adjustments to the fair value of all investments. These investments valued using NAV as a practical expedient are typically valued on a monthly or quarterly basis by third-party administrators, valuation agents or fund managers with an annual audit performed by an independent third party, but certain of these investments have a lag in the availability of data. This primarily applies to private equity, private equity-related strategies and real assets. We solicit valuation updates from the investment fund managers and use their information and corroborating data from public markets to determine any needed fair value adjustments.\nFor additional information on our significant accounting policies related to defined benefit pension plans, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nCredit Losses.\nIn 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\" Under this ASU, an entity is required to utilize an \"expected credit loss model\" on certain financial instruments, including trade and financing receivables. This model requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information and requires an entity to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2020 and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recorded reserves on certain receivables, which are discussed further in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes.\nIn 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.\" This standard simplifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for income taxes by clarifying existing guidance to improve consistency in application of ASC 740. This standard also removed the requirement to calculate income tax expense for the stand-alone financial statements of wholly owned subsidiaries. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2020 with no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               50\nItem 7. MD&A - Supplemental Information\nSupplemental Information\nWe sometimes use information (\"non-GAAP financial measures\") that is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Reconciliations below may not calculate exactly due to rounding.\nPre-Tax (Loss)/Income, adjusted\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of pre-tax (loss)/income (a GAAP measure) to pre-tax (loss)/income, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure).\nIn 2020, pre-tax (loss)/income, adjusted excludes the following items\ndirectly related to the impact of COVID-19 and our response for comparability with the prior period:\n•\nRestructuring charges.\nWe recognized restructuring charges following strategic business decisions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These charges primarily include impairments and related charges from retirement decisions related to approximately 400 aircraft and the voluntary early retirement and separation programs.\n•\nGovernment grant recognition.\nWe recognized the full grant proceeds from the CARES Act payroll support program as a contra-expense in 2020. We recognized the grant proceeds based on the periods that the funds were intended to benefit.\n•\nImpairments and equity method losses.\nDuring 2020, we recognized charges and the related income tax impacts from write-downs of our investments in LATAM and Grupo Aeroméxico following their financial losses and separate Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings, and the write-down of our investment in Virgin Atlantic based on our share of its losses.\n•\nPension settlement charges.\nThese charges were recognized in connection with the voluntary programs.\nWe also regularly adjust pre-tax (loss)/income for the following items to determine pre-tax (loss)/income, adjusted for the reasons described below:\n•\nMTM adjustments and settlements on hedges.\nMark-to-market (\n\"\nMTM\") adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the applicable period.\n•\nEquity investment MTM adjustments.\nWe previously recorded our proportionate share of losses from our equity investments in Virgin Atlantic, Grupo Aeroméxico and LATAM in non-operating expense. (As a result of Grupo Aeroméxico's and LATAM’s bankruptcy filings, we no longer have significant influence with Grupo Aeroméxico or LATAM and discontinued accounting for these investments under the equity method in the June 2020 quarter.) We adjust for our equity method investees' hedge portfolio MTM adjustments to allow investors to understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.\n•\nMTM adjustments on investments.\nUnrealized gains/losses result from our equity investments that are accounted for at fair value in non-operating expense. The gains/losses are driven by changes in stock prices, foreign currency fluctuations and other valuation techniques for investments in companies without publicly-traded shares. Adjusting for these gains/losses allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.\n•\nDelta Private Jets adjustment\n. Because we combined Delta Private Jets with Wheels Up in January 2020, we have excluded the impact of Delta Private Jets from 2019 results for comparability.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               51\nItem 7. MD&A - Supplemental Information\nOperating Expense, adjusted\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of operating expense (a GAAP measure) to operating expense, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure). In 2020, operating expense, adjusted excludes the following items directly related to the impact of COVID-19 and our response: restructuring charges and government grant recognition, as discussed above under the heading pre-tax (loss)/income, adjusted. We also adjust operating expense for the following items for the reasons described below. We adjust for MTM adjustments and settlements on hedges and Delta Private Jets adjustment for the same reasons described above under the heading pre-tax (loss)/income, adjusted.\n•\nThird-party refinery sales.\nWe adjust operating expense for refinery sales to third parties to determine operating expense, adjusted because these revenues, and related expenses, are not related to our airline segment. Operating expense, adjusted therefore provides a more meaningful comparison of operating expenses from our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               52\nItem 7. MD&A - Supplemental Information\nFree Cash Flow\nWe present free cash flow because management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for use for debt service or general corporate initiatives. Adjustments include:\n•\nNet purchases\nof short-term investments.\nNet purchases of short-term investments represent the net purchase and sale activity of investments and marketable securities in the period, including gains and losses. We adjust for this activity to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow generated by our operations.\n•\nStrategic investments and related.\nCash flows related to our investment in and related transactions with other airlines are included in our GAAP investing activities. We adjust for this activity because it provides a more meaningful comparison to our airline industry peers.\n•\nNet cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and other.\nCash flows related to certain airport construction projects are included in our GAAP operating activities and capital expenditures. We have adjusted for these items, which were primarily funded by cash restricted for airport construction, to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow and capital expenditures that are core to our operational performance in the periods shown.\nTRASM, adjusted\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of TRASM (a GAAP measure) to TRASM, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure). We adjust TRASM for refinery sales to third parties for the same reason described above under the heading operating expense, adjusted. We adjust for Delta Private Jets for the same reason described above under the heading pre-tax (loss)/income, adjusted.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               53\nItem 7. MD&A - Supplemental Information\nCASM-Ex\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of CASM (a GAAP measure) to CASM-Ex (a non-GAAP financial measure). In 2020, CASM-Ex excludes the following items directly related to the impact of COVID-19 and our response: restructuring charges and government grant recognition, as discussed above under the heading pre-tax (loss)/income, adjusted. We also adjust CASM for the following items to determine CASM-Ex for the reasons described below. We adjust for refinery sales to third parties for the same reason described above under the heading operating expense, adjusted. We adjust for Delta Private Jets for the same reason described above under the heading pre-tax (loss)/income, adjusted.\n•\nAircraft fuel and related taxes.\nThe volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance. The adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and year-over-year financial performance.\n•\nProfit sharing.\nWe adjust for profit sharing because this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry.\nConsolidated CASM, adjusted\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of CASM (a GAAP measure) to consolidated CASM, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure). In 2020, consolidated CASM, adjusted excludes the following items directly related to the impact of COVID-19 and our response: restructuring charges and government grant recognition, as discussed above under the heading pre-tax (loss)/income, adjusted. We also adjust CASM for MTM adjustments and settlements on hedges and for Delta Private Jets for the same reason described above under the heading pre-tax (loss)/income, adjusted. We adjust for refinery sales to third parties for the same reason described above under the heading operating expense, adjusted.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               54\nItem 7.

Market Risk"

    "text": "We have market risk exposure related to fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In an effort to manage our exposure to these risks, we may enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative contracts. We expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders' equity.\nThe following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel, the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk. For these and other reasons, the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results.\nFuel Price Risk\nChanges in fuel prices materially impact our results of operations. A one cent increase in the cost of jet fuel would result in approximately $40 million\nof additional annual fuel expense based on annual pre-COVID-19 pandemic consumption of approximately four billion gallons of jet fuel. As a result of the reduced capacity from the COVID-19 pandemic, our jet fuel consumption during 2020 of 1.9 billion gallons was significantly less than our historical and expected future consumption. Our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to Monroe’s inventory.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our debt obligations. Market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings, respectively, from an increase in interest rates.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had\n$22.3 billion of fixed-rate debt and $5.9 billion of variable-rate debt. The rates used in our variable-rate debt are based on LIBOR, or another index rate, which in certain cases is subject to a floor. An increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variable-rate debt and variable-rate leases by $29 million.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the London interbank offered rate (\"LIBOR\") after 2021. In December 2020, the administrator of LIBOR proposed to cease publication of certain LIBOR settings after December 2021 and to cease publication of the remainder of the LIBOR settings after June 2023. To mitigate the possible impact of this change, various regulators have proposed alternative reference rates. The effect of any discontinuation or replacement of LIBOR cannot be predicted at this time, but we believe our risk would be limited to variable-rate debt and variable-rate finance leases which utilize rates for which the settings are to be discontinued after June 2023 because we have an immaterial amount of contracts that utilize the settings to be discontinued immediately after December 2021. At December 31, 2020 we had approximately $3.8 billion of variable-rate debt and variable-rate finance leases maturing after June 2023, all of which include provisions to update the applicable reference rate, and we do not expect this rate to be materially different from LIBOR.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue, expense and equity investments denominated in foreign currencies. To manage exchange rate risk, we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had a U.S. dollar-South Korean won cross currency swap contract totaling a $13 million liability position. We estimate that a 10% depreciation or appreciation in the price of the South Korean won in relation to the U.S. dollar would have changed the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contract by $17 million for the year ending December 31, 2020.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               56\nFinancial Statements"

(the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss)/income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 12, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               58\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               59\nFair Value of Fleet Assets\nRealizability of Deferred Tax Assets\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               60\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               61\nFinancial Statements\nDELTA AIR LINES, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               62\nFinancial Statements\nDELTA AIR LINES, INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               63\nFinancial Statements\nDELTA AIR LINES, INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss)/Income\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               64\nFinancial Statements\nDELTA AIR LINES, INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               65\nFinancial Statements\nDELTA AIR LINES, INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity\n(1)\nTreasury shares were withheld for payment of taxes, at a weighted average price per share of $\n52.17\n, $\n50.20\nand $\n54.90\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               66\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nDelta Air Lines, Inc., a Delaware corporation, provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States (\"U.S.\") and around the world. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Delta Air Lines, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). We are the primary beneficiary of, and have a controlling financial interest in, certain immaterial entities in which we have voting rights of 50% or less, which we consolidate in our financial results.\nWe have marketing alliances with other airlines to enhance our access to domestic and international markets. These arrangements may include codesharing, reciprocal loyalty program benefits, shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges, joint promotions, common use of airport gates and ticket counters, ticket office co-location and other marketing agreements. We have received antitrust immunity for certain marketing arrangements, which enables us to offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales, marketing and discount programs for customers. Some of our marketing arrangements provide for the sharing of revenues and expenses. Revenues and expenses associated with collaborative arrangements are presented on a gross basis in the applicable line items on our Consolidated Statements of Operations (\"income statement\").\nWe have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts disclosed are stated before consideration of income taxes.\nUse of Estimates\nWe are required to make estimates and assumptions when preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nCredit Losses.\nIn 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\" Under this ASU, an entity is required to utilize an \"expected credit loss model\" on certain financial instruments, including trade and financing receivables. This model requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information and requires an entity to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2020 and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recorded reserves on certain receivables, which are discussed further in Note 5, \"Investments.\"\nIncome Taxes.\nIn 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.\" This standard simplifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for income taxes by clarifying existing guidance to improve consistency in application of ASC 740. This standard also removed the requirement to calculate income tax expense for the stand-alone financial statements of wholly owned subsidiaries. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2020 with no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               67\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed below or included within the topic-specific notes included herein.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments\nShort-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are classified as cash and cash equivalents.\nInvestments with maturities of greater than three months, but not in excess of one year, when purchased are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year when purchased may be classified as short-term investments if they are expected to be available to support our short-term liquidity needs. Our short-term investments were classified as fair value investments and gains and losses were recorded in non-operating expense.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheets (\"balance sheets\") that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (\"cash flows statement\").\nInventories\nFuel.\nAs part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel, our wholly owned subsidiaries, Monroe Energy, LLC and MIPC, LLC (collectively, \"Monroe\"), operate the Trainer oil refinery. Refined product, feedstock and blendstock inventories, all of which are finished goods, are carried at recoverable cost. We use jet fuel in our airline operations that is produced by the refinery and procured through the exchange with third parties of gasoline, diesel and other refined products (\"non-jet fuel products\") the refinery produces. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Costs include the raw material consumed plus direct manufacturing costs (such as labor, utilities and supplies) incurred and an applicable portion of manufacturing overhead.\nExpendables Parts and Supplies.\nInventories of expendable parts related to flight equipment, which cannot be economically repaired, reconditioned or reused after removal from the aircraft, are carried at moving average cost and charged to operations as consumed. An allowance for obsolescence is provided over the remaining useful life of the related fleet. We also provide allowances for parts identified as excess or obsolete to reduce the carrying costs to the lower of cost or net realizable value. These parts are assumed to have an estimated residual value of\n5\n% of the original cost.\nAccounting for Refinery Related Buy/Sell Agreements\nTo the extent that we receive jet fuel for non-jet fuel products exchanged under buy/sell agreements, we account for these transactions as nonmonetary exchanges. We have recorded these nonmonetary exchanges at the carrying amount of the non-jet fuel products transferred within aircraft fuel and related taxes on the income statement.\nDerivatives\nChanges in fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations. In an effort to manage our exposure to these risks, we may enter into derivative contracts and adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change. We recognize derivative contracts at fair value on our balance sheets.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               68\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table summarizes the risk hedged and the classification of related gains and losses in our income statement, by each type of derivative contract:\nThe following table summarizes the accounting treatment of our derivative contracts:\n(1)\nIncluding settled gains and losses as well as mark-to-market adjustments (\"MTM adjustments\").\nWe perform, at least quarterly, an assessment of the effectiveness of our derivative contracts designated as hedges, including assessing the possibility of counterparty default. If we determine that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively and recognize subsequent changes in the fair value of the hedge in earnings. We believe our derivative contracts that continue to be designated as hedges, consisting of interest rate exchange contracts, will continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk.\nCash flows associated with purchasing and settling hedge contracts generally are classified as operating cash flows. However, if a hedge contract includes a significant financing element at inception, cash flows associated with the hedge contract are recorded as financing cash flows.\nHedge Margin.\nThe hedge margin we receive from counterparties is recorded in cash, with the offsetting obligation in accounts payable. The hedge margin we provide to counterparties is recorded in prepaid expenses and other. We do not offset margin funded to counterparties or margin funded to us by counterparties against fair value amounts recorded for our hedge contracts.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nOur flight equipment, which consists of aircraft and associated engines and parts, and other long-lived assets, which are classified as property and equipment, net on our balance sheet, have a recorded value of $\n26.5\nbillion at December 31, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes our property and equipment:\n(1)\nIncludes accumulated amortization for flight and ground equipment under finance leases in the amount of $\n793\nmillion and $\n546\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               69\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe record property and equipment at cost and depreciate or amortize these assets on a straight-line basis to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life for leasehold improvements is the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life.\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to our property and equipment was $\n2.3\nbillion, $\n2.6\nbillion and $\n2.3\nbillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Residual values for owned aircraft, engines, spare parts and simulators are generally\n5\n% to\n10\n% of cost.\nWe capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to develop and implement software and amortize those costs over an estimated useful life of\nthree\nto\nten\nyears.\nIncluded in the depreciation and amortization expense discussed above, we recorded $\n304\nmillion, $\n239\nmillion and $\n205\nmillion for amortization of capitalized software for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The net book value of these assets, which are included in information technology-related assets above, totaled $\n1.0\nbillion and $\n1.1\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur tangible assets consist primarily of flight equipment, which is mobile across geographic markets. Accordingly, assets are not allocated to specific geographic regions.\nWe review flight equipment and other long-lived assets used in operations for impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. Factors which could be indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to (1) a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, (2) significant changes in the estimated useful life, (3) significant changes in projected cash flows, (4) permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and (5) changes to the regulatory environment. For long-lived assets held for sale, we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell. See Note 2, \"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,\" for information on impairments and related charges recorded during 2020.\nTo determine whether impairments exist for active and temporarily parked aircraft, we group assets at the fleet type level or at the contract level for aircraft operated by third-party regional carriers (i.e., the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel and labor costs and other relevant factors. Given the substantial reduction in our active aircraft and diminished projections of future cash flows in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated our fleet during 2020 and determined that only the fleet types discussed in Note 2, \"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,\" were impaired, as the future cash flows from the operation of all other fleet types through the respective retirement dates exceeded the carrying value. As we obtain greater clarity about the duration and extent of reduced demand and potentially execute further capacity adjustments, we will continue to evaluate our fleet compared to network requirements and may decide to retire additional aircraft. Future decisions regarding the temporarily parked aircraft and the timing of any return to service will be dependent on the evolution of the demand environment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for deferred income taxes under the liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are net by jurisdiction and are recorded as noncurrent on the balance sheet.\nWe have elected to recognize earnings of foreign affiliates that are determined to be global intangible low tax income in the period it arises and do not recognize deferred taxes for basis differences that may reverse in future years.\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when necessary. We periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets. We establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results and tax planning strategies. See Note 13, \"Income Taxes,\" for further information on our deferred income taxes.\nFuel Card Obligation\nWe have a purchasing card with American Express for the purpose of buying jet fuel and crude oil. The card carried a maximum credit limit of $\n1.1\nbillion as of December 31, 2020 and must be paid monthly.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n736\nmillion outstanding on this purchasing card, respectively, and the activity was classified as a financing activity in our cash flows statement.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               70\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nRetirement of Repurchased Shares\nWe immediately retire shares repurchased pursuant to any share repurchase program. We allocate the share purchase price in excess of par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.\nManufacturers' Credits\nWe periodically receive credits in connection with the acquisition of aircraft and engines. These credits are deferred until the aircraft and engines are delivered, and then applied as a reduction to the cost of the related equipment.\nMaintenance Costs\nWe record maintenance costs related to our fleet in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, except for costs incurred under power-by-the-hour contracts, which are expensed based on actual hours flown. Power-by-the-hour contracts transfer certain risk to third-party service providers and fix the amount we pay per flight hour to the service provider in exchange for maintenance and repairs under a predefined maintenance program. Modifications that enhance the operating performance or extend the useful lives of airframes or engines are capitalized and amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\nAdvertising Costs\nWe expense advertising costs in passenger commissions and other selling expenses in the year the advertising first takes place.\nAdvertising expense was $\n119\nmillion, $\n288\nmillion and $\n267\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCommissions and Merchant Fees\nPassenger sales commissions and merchant fees are recognized in operating expense when the related revenue is recognized.\nNOTE 2.\nIMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe unprecedented, widespread and persistent impact of COVID-19 and the related travel restrictions and social distancing measures implemented throughout the world have significantly reduced demand for air travel. After initially impacting our service to China beginning in January 2020, the spread of the virus and the resulting global pandemic have significantly affected our entire network. Beginning in March 2020, large public events were cancelled, governmental authorities began imposing restrictions on non-essential activities, businesses suspended travel and popular leisure destinations temporarily closed to visitors. Certain countries that are key markets for our business have imposed bans on international travelers for specified periods or indefinitely.\nAs a result, demand for travel declined at a rapid pace in the March 2020 quarter and has remained depressed, which has had an unprecedented and materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. Although demand has improved at a slow pace since that time, it remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since experienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, while others, particularly international markets, remain closed or are enforcing extended quarantines for most U.S. residents. The U.S. and numerous other countries are now also requiring airline passengers to provide negative COVID-19 test results prior to travel into their countries. Additionally, some states have instituted travel restrictions, advisories or quarantines for travelers from other states within the U.S. We expect the demand environment to remain depressed until effective vaccines become broadly available, vaccination becomes widespread globally and travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease. Our forecasted expense and liquidity management initiatives may be modified as the demand environment evolves.\nIn response to these developments, we have implemented enhanced measures focusing on the safety of our customers and employees, while at the same time seeking to mitigate the impact on our financial position and operations and to position our business for recovery.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               71\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nTaking Care of our Customers and Employees.\nThe safety of our customers and employees is our primary focus. As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, we have taken numerous steps to help promote the safety of our customers and employees on the ground and in the air in keeping with current health-expert recommendations, including:\n•\nAdopting new cleaning procedures on all flights, including regular disinfectant electrostatic spraying on aircraft and sanitizing high-touch areas like tray tables, entertainment screens, armrests and seat-back pockets.\n•\nTaking steps to help employees and customers practice social distancing and promote safety, including:\n◦\nCreating a Global Cleanliness Division to ensure a consistently safe and sanitized experience across our facilities and aircraft.\n◦\nBeginning in May 2020, requiring all customers and customer-facing employees to wear masks.\n◦\nCapping load factors throughout our aircraft and blocking middle seats through at least April 30, 2021.\n◦\nModifying our boarding and deplaning processes, while providing limited food and beverage service that is designed to reduce physical touch points.\n◦\nEncouraging social distancing throughout all aspects of our operation.\n◦\nImplementing significant workforce social distancing and protection measures, including reconfiguring call center spaces to promote social distancing, increasing cleaning and disinfecting of our facilities and encouraging employees to work remotely when possible.\n•\nGiving customers flexibility to plan and re-book travel, including extending expiration on certain tickets and travel credits through December 2022, eliminating change fees for domestic tickets and international tickets originating from North America, with the exception of Basic Economy tickets, and waiving change fees for all tickets purchased before March 30, 2021. Additionally, we are extending 2020 Medallion Status an additional year, rolling Medallion Qualification Miles into 2021 and extending Delta SkyMiles American Express Card benefits and Delta Sky Club memberships.\n•\nOffering pay protection to employees who have tested positive for COVID-19, who must quarantine due to exposure to COVID-19, who are considered being at high-risk for illness from COVID-19 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") guidelines and do not have the ability to work remotely.\n•\nOffering on-site rapid COVID-19 testing in most locations and making at-home testing available for all U.S.-based employees. We have also added rapid testing in most U.S. hubs for active flight crews.\nCapacity Reductions.\nBeginning in the second half of March 2020, we experienced a precipitous decrease in demand as COVID-19 spread throughout the world. While we have increased capacity compared to the lowest levels in April 2020, system capacity remains significantly lower than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2020, system capacity was reduced approximately\n50\n%\ncompared to 2019, with international capacity reduced by approximately\n65\n%\nand domestic capacity reduced by approximately\n45\n%. System capacity for the March 2020 through December 2020 period, excluding the pre-pandemic months of January and February, was reduced by approximately\n60\n%, with international capacity reduced by approximately\n75\n% and domestic capacity reduced by approximately\n50\n%. For the March 2021 quarter, system capacity is expected to be down approximately\n30\n-\n40\n% compared to the March 2019 quarter. As a result of reduced demand and lower capacity, we retired\n227\naircraft in 2020 and have temporarily parked approximately\n125\naircraft as of December 31, 2020.\nExpense Management.\nIn response to the reduction in revenue, we have implemented, and will continue to implement, cost saving initiatives, including the following in 2020:\n•\nReducing capacity as described above to align with expected demand, which has resulted in removing from active service approximately\n350\naircraft as of December 31, 2020, including certain fleets or aircraft that we have decided to early retire as described below.\n•\nConsolidating our footprint at our airport facilities, including temporarily closing some Delta Sky Clubs.\n•\nAvoiding furloughs for our U.S. employees and reducing employee-related costs, through the following:\n◦\nVoluntary unpaid leaves of\n30\ndays to\n12\nmonths offered to most employees. Approximately\n50,000\nof our employees have taken or have elected to take voluntary leaves at various times during 2020 and, for those taking leaves up to 12 months, continuing through 2021.\n◦\nOffering employees early retirement and voluntary separation programs, with approximately\n18,000\nemployees electing to participate.\nSee Note 11, \"Employee Benefit Plans,\" for additional information.\n◦\nReaching an agreement with ALPA that protects our pilots from furlough through April 2022.\n◦\nFrom April 1 through December 31, 2020, salary reductions of\n100\n% for our CEO,\n50\n% for our officers and a\n25\n% reduction in work hours for all other management and most front-line employee work groups.\n•\nDelaying or eliminating nearly all other discretionary spending.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               72\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nBalance Sheet, Cash Flow and Liquidity.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities (\"liquidity\") as of December 31, 2020 was $\n16.7\nbillion as a result of the following actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position during the year ended December 31, 2020:\n•\nCompleting financing transactions for an aggregate principal amount of approximately\n$\n25.9\nbillion.\n•\nReceiving $\n5.6\nbillion as part of the CARES Act payroll support program as described in \"Government Support Programs\" below.\n•\nReducing planned capital expenditures by approximately\n$\n2.8\nbillion for the year to $\n1.9\nbillion, including restructuring our aircraft order books for future aircraft deliveries, delaying aircraft modifications and postponing certain information technology initiatives and ground equipment replacement. See Note 12, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" for additional information about our aircraft purchase commitments.\n•\nAmending our credit facilities to replace fixed charge coverage ratio covenants with liquidity-based covenants.\n•\nSuspending share repurchases and dividends indefinitely and postponing voluntary pension funding.\nIn addition, in January 2021 we received $\n1.4\nbillion with respect to the payroll support program extension described below, with the remaining $\n1.5\nbillion expected in the March 2021 quarter.\nIn response to the impact that the demand environment has had on our financial condition, our credit rating was downgraded by Standard & Poor's to BB in March 2020 and by Fitch to BB+ in April 2020. Our credit rating from Moody's remains Baa3. See \"Financial Condition and Liquidity - Sources and Uses of Liquidity\" for additional information.\nSee Note 8, \"Debt,\" and Note 9, \"Leases,\" for more information on our financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGovernment Support Programs\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") was enacted into law. The CARES Act is a support package intended to assist many aspects of the American economy, including providing the airline industry with up to $25 billion in grants and loans to be used for employee wages, salaries and benefits.\nIn April 2020, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to receive emergency support through the CARES Act payroll support program, which totaled $\n5.6\nbillion. The support payments were conditioned on our agreement to comply with a variety of conditions, including to refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through September 30, 2020. The support payments consisted of $\n4.0\nbillion in a grant and $\n1.6\nbillion in an unsecured\n10\n-year low interest loan. The loan bears interest at an annual rate of\n1.00\n% for the first five years (through April 2025) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus\n2.00\n% in the final five years. In return, we issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury warrants to acquire more than\n6.7\nmillion shares of Delta common stock, which represented approximately\n1\n% of our outstanding shares. These warrants have an initial exercise price of $\n24.39\nper share, subject to adjustment in certain cases, and a five-year term.\nThe relative fair value of the warrants issued in 2020 is recorded within stockholder's equity and as a discount reducing the carrying value of the loan which is being amortized as interest expense in our income statement over the term of the loan. The proceeds of the 2020 CARES Act grant were recorded in cash and cash equivalents when received and were recognized as contra-expense in government grant recognition in our income statement over the periods that the funds were intended to compensate. See Note 8 \"Debt,\" for further discussion of the unsecured loan and warrants to acquire Delta shares issued under the CARES Act payroll support program.\nFinally, the CARES Act also provides for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. This provided us with approximately $\n200\nmillion of additional liquidity during 2020.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               73\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOn December 27, 2020, an additional COVID-19 support bill was enacted into law, which extends the payroll support program of the CARES Act and provides an additional $15 billion in grants and loans to be used for airline employee wages, salaries and benefits. In January 2021, we entered into a payroll support program extension agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. We expect to receive $\n2.9\nbillion in payroll support payments, which must be used exclusively for the payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits and are conditioned on our agreement to refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs from the date of the extension agreement through March 2021. Other conditions include prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through March 2022 and certain limitations on executive compensation until October 2022. The Department of Transportation also has the authority until March 1, 2022 to require airlines that received payroll support program funds to maintain scheduled air service deemed necessary to any point served by the airline before March 1, 2020.\nThe expected support payments consist of approximately\n$\n2.0\nbillion in grants and $\n830\nmillion in an unsecured\n10\n-year low interest loan. We received the first installment of $\n1.4\nbillion under the agreement on January 15, 2021 and expect to receive the balance in the March 2021 quarter. The loan bears interest at an annual rate of\n1.00\n% for the first five years (through January 15, 2026) and the applicable SOFR plus\n2.00\n% in the final five years. Approximately\n70\n% of the payment received on January 15, 2021 was in the form of a grant, and approximately\n30\n% was in the form of an unsecured loan. We issued a promissory note for approximately $\n400\nmillion with respect to the term loan, which will increase to its full principal amount as the balance of payroll support payments is received. In connection with receipt of these payments, we also expect to issue to the U.S. Department of the Treasury warrants to acquire shares of Delta common stock, which we expect to be approximately\n2.1\nmillion shares representing less than\n0.5\n% of our outstanding shares. Approximately one-half of the expected warrants were issued on January 15, 2021 and the remaining warrants will be issued as the balance of payroll support payments is received. These warrants have an initial exercise price of $\n39.73\nper share, subject to adjustment in certain cases, and a five-year term.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               74\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nRestructuring Charges\nThe restructuring charges incurred during 2020 as part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic are summarized as follows:\nFleet Retirements.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our response, we have removed certain aircraft from active service as of December 31, 2020, which includes owned and leased aircraft that are being retired early.\n(1)\nCertain of the CRJ-200 aircraft scheduled to be retired by the December 2023 quarter are operated for us by SkyWest Airlines under a revenue proration agreement.\n(2)\nDuring the March 2020 quarter, we recorded a $\n22\nmillion charge related to accelerating the planned retirement of the MD-88 fleet from December 2020 to June 2020. However, this amount was recorded in depreciation and amortization, rather than in restructuring charges, as it would have been incurred during 2020 prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThese impairment and other related charges are recorded in restructuring charges in our income statement. These charges were calculated using Level 3 fair value inputs based primarily upon recent market transactions and third-party bids, which were corroborated with published pricing guides and our assessment of existing market conditions based on industry knowledge. Following the impairment charges, the remaining aggregate net book value of these aircraft as of December 31, 2020 is approximately $\n500\nmillion.\nVoluntary Programs and Other Employee Benefit Charges.\nSee Note 11, \"Employee Benefit Plans,\" for further information on these charges.\nReceivables and Other.\nSee Note 5, \"Investments,\" for further information on certain of these charges.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               75\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 3.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nPassenger Revenue\nPassenger revenue is primarily composed of passenger ticket sales, loyalty travel awards and travel-related services performed in conjunction with a passenger’s flight.\nTicket\nPassenger Tickets.\nWe defer sales of passenger tickets to be flown by us or that we sell on behalf of other airlines in our air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized when we provide transportation or when ticket breakage occurs. For tickets that we sell on behalf of other airlines, we reduce the air traffic liability when consideration is remitted to those airlines. The air traffic liability primarily includes sales of passenger tickets to be flown in the future and credits which can be applied as payment toward the cost of a ticket (\"travel credits\"). Travel credits are typically issued as a result of ticket cancellations prior to their expiration dates. We periodically evaluate the estimated air traffic liability and record any adjustments in our income statement. These adjustments relate primarily to refunds, exchanges, ticket breakage, transactions with other airlines and other items for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets at amounts other than the original sales price.\nThe air traffic liability typically increases during the winter and spring months as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months. However, the ongoing reduction in demand for air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented low level of advance bookings and the associated cash received, as well as significant ticket cancellations which led to issuance of cash refunds or travel credits to customers. The total value of cash refunds, excluding taxes and related fees, issued to customers during 2020 was approximately $\n3.1\nbillion.\nTravel credits represented approximately\n65\n% of the air traffic liability as of December 31, 2020.\nPrior to April 2020, passenger tickets sold and credits issued were generally valid for\none year from the date of original ticket issuance\n. During 2020, we announced the extension of expiration on certain tickets and travel credits through December 2022. The air traffic liability classified as noncurrent as of December 31, 2020 represents our current estimate of tickets and credits to be used or refunded beyond one year, while the balance classified as current represents our current estimate of tickets and credits to be used or refunded within one year. We will continue to monitor our customers' travel behavior and may adjust our estimates in the future.\nApproximately $\n3.1\nbillion, $\n3.8\nbillion and $\n3.5\nbillion of the prior year air traffic liability related to passenger ticket sales (which excludes those tickets sold on behalf of other airlines) was recognized in passenger revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nTicket Breakage.\nWe estimate the value of tickets that will expire unused and recognize revenue at the scheduled flight date. We periodically evaluate our breakage estimates, which are based on historical experience, ticket contract terms and customers’ travel behavior, and may adjust our estimates in the future.\nRegional Carriers\n. Our regional carriers include both third-party regional carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements (\"contract carriers\") and Endeavor Air, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary. Our contract carrier agreements are primarily structured as capacity purchase agreements where we purchase all or a portion of the contract carrier's capacity and are responsible for selling the seat inventory we purchase. We record revenue related to our capacity purchase agreements in passenger revenue and the related expenses in regional carriers expense, excluding fuel.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               76\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nLoyalty Travel Awards\nLoyalty travel awards revenue is related to the redemption of miles for travel. We recognize loyalty travel awards revenue in passenger revenue as miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. See below for discussion of our loyalty program accounting policies.\nTravel-Related Services\nTravel-related services are primarily composed of services\nperformed in conjunction with a passenger’s flight, including administrative fees (such as ticket change fees), baggage fees and on-board sales. We recognize revenue for these services when the related transportation service is provided.\nDuring 2020, we waived change fees for all tickets purchased through March 30, 2021 and eliminated change fees for domestic tickets and international tickets originating from North America, with the exception of Basic Economy tickets.\nLoyalty Program\nOur SkyMiles loyalty program generates customer loyalty by rewarding customers with incentives to travel on Delta. This program allows customers to earn mileage credits (\"miles\") by flying on Delta, Delta Connection and other airlines that participate in the loyalty program. When traveling, customers earn miles based on the passenger's loyalty program status and ticket price. Customers can also earn miles through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies and ridesharing companies. Miles are redeemable by customers in future periods for air travel on Delta and other participating airlines, membership in our Sky Club and other program awards. To facilitate transactions with participating companies, we sell miles to non-airline businesses, customers and other airlines.\nThe loyalty program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations (1) passenger ticket sales earning miles and (2) sale of miles to participating companies.\nPassenger Ticket Sales Earning Miles.\nPassenger ticket sales earning miles provide customers with (1) miles earned and (2) air transportation, which are each considered performance obligations. We value each performance obligation on a standalone basis. To value the miles earned, we consider the quantitative value a passenger receives by redeeming miles for a ticket rather than paying cash, which is referred to as equivalent ticket value (\"ETV\"). Our estimate of ETV is adjusted for miles that are not likely to be redeemed (\"breakage\"). We use statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions to the redemption activity for miles or the estimated fair value of miles expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. We recognize breakage proportionally during the period in which the remaining miles are actually redeemed.\nWe defer revenue for the miles when earned and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. We record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize passenger revenue when we provide transportation or if the ticket goes unused.\nSale of Miles to Participating Companies.\nCustomers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies and ridesharing companies with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles. Our contracts to sell miles under these marketing agreements have multiple performance obligations. Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period, and the initial terms of our marketing contracts are from\nthree\nto\neleven\nyears. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, total cash sales from marketing agreements were $\n2.8\nbillion, $\n4.2\nbillion and $\n3.5\nbillion, respectively, which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations, as discussed below.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               77\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur most significant contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. Our agreements with American Express provide for joint marketing, grant certain benefits to Delta-American Express co-branded credit card holders (\"cardholders\") and American Express Membership Rewards program participants, and allow American Express to market its services or products using our customer database. Cardholders earn miles for making purchases using co-branded cards, and certain cardholders may also check their first bag for free, are granted discounted access to Delta Sky Club lounges and receive priority boarding and other benefits while traveling on Delta. Additionally, participants in the American Express Membership Rewards program may exchange their points for miles under the loyalty program. We sell miles at agreed-upon rates to American Express which are then provided to their customers under the co-brand credit card program and the Membership Rewards program. Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our co-brand and other agreements with American Express which increased the value we receive and extended the terms to 2029. The products and services delivered are consistent with previous agreements.\nWe account for marketing agreements, including those with American Express, by allocating the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered. We allocate the value based on the relative selling prices of those products and services, which generally consist of award travel, priority boarding, baggage fee waivers, lounge access and the use of our brand. We determine our best estimate of the selling prices by using a discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) ETV for the award travel obligation adjusted for breakage, (3) published rates on our website for baggage fees, discounted access to Delta Sky Club lounges and other benefits while traveling on Delta, (4) brand value (using estimated royalties generated from the use of our brand) and (5) volume discounts provided to certain partners.\nWe defer the amount allocated to award travel as part of loyalty program deferred revenue and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. Revenue allocated to services performed in conjunction with a passenger’s flight, such as baggage fee waivers, is recognized as travel-related services in passenger revenue when the related service is performed. Revenue allocated to access Delta Sky Club lounges is recognized as miscellaneous in other revenue as access is provided. Revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations, primarily brand value, is recorded as loyalty program in other revenue as miles are delivered.\nIn September 2020, we raised $\n9.0\nbillion through the issuance of notes and entry into a term loan facility, each secured by certain assets related to our SkyMiles program. See Note 8, \"Debt,\" for further discussion of these transactions.\nCurrent Activity of the Loyalty Program.\nMiles are combined in one homogeneous pool and are not separately identifiable. Therefore, the revenue is comprised of miles that were part of the loyalty program deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period as well as miles that were issued during the period.\nThe table below presents the activity of the current and noncurrent loyalty program deferred revenue, and includes miles earned through travel and miles sold to participating companies, which are primarily through marketing agreements.\nThe timing of mile redemptions can vary widely; however, the majority of new miles have historically been redeemed within\ntwo years\n. The loyalty program deferred revenue classified as a current liability represents our current estimate of revenue expected to be recognized in the next twelve months based on projected redemptions, while the balance classified as a noncurrent liability represents our current estimate of revenue expected to be recognized beyond twelve months. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a larger portion of mile redemptions is projected to occur beyond twelve months and is therefore reflected as a noncurrent liability as of December 31, 2020. We will continue to monitor redemptions as the situation evolves.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               78\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nRevenue by Geographic Region\nOperating revenue for the airline segment is recognized in a specific geographic region based on the origin, flight path and destination of each flight segment. A significant portion of the refinery's revenues typically consists of fuel sales to support the airline, which is eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The remaining operating revenue for the refinery segment is included in the domestic region. Our passenger and operating revenue by geographic region is summarized in the following table:\nCargo Revenue\nCargo revenue is recognized when we provide the transportation.\nOther Revenue\nAncillary Businesses and Refinery.\nAncillary businesses and refinery includes refinery sales to third parties, aircraft maintenance provided to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations. Third-party refinery production sales are at or near cost; accordingly, the margin on these sales is de minimis. See Note 16, \"Segments,\" for more information on revenue recognition within our refinery segment.\nIn January 2020, we combined Delta Private Jets, our former wholly owned subsidiary which provided private jet operations, with Wheels Up. Upon closing, we received an equity stake in Wheels Up, and Delta Private Jets is no longer reflected in ancillary businesses and refinery. See Note 5, \"Investments,\" for more information on this transaction.\nLoyalty Program.\nLoyalty program revenues relate primarily to brand usage by third parties and include the redemption of miles for non-travel awards. These revenues are included within the total cash sales from marketing agreements, discussed above.\nMiscellaneous.\nMiscellaneous revenue is primarily composed of lounge access and codeshare revenues.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from credit card companies from the sale of passenger tickets, ancillary businesses and refinery sales and other companies for the purchase of miles under the loyalty program. We provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts using an expected credit loss model which represents our estimate of expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recorded reserves on certain receivables, which are discussed further in Note 5, \"Investments.\"\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               79\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nPassenger Taxes and Fees\nWe are required to charge certain taxes and fees on our passenger tickets, including U.S. federal transportation taxes, federal security charges, airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes. These taxes and fees are assessments on the customer for which we act as a collection agent. Because we are not entitled to retain these taxes and fees, we do not include such amounts in passenger revenue. We record a liability when the amounts are collected and reduce the liability when payments are made to the applicable government agency or operating carrier (i.e., for codeshare-related fees).\nNOTE 4.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\n•\nLevel 1.\nObservable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets.\n•\nLevel 2\n. Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly.\n•\nLevel 3\n. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on the valuation techniques identified in the tables below. The valuation techniques are as follows:\n(a)\nMarket Approach\n. Prices and other relevant information generated by observable transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities; and\n(b)\nIncome Approach.\nTechniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount based on market expectations (including present value techniques and option-pricing models).\nAssets (Liabilities) Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n(1)\n(1)\nSee Note 11, \"Employee Benefit Plans,\" for fair value of benefit plan assets.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               80\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nCash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Equivalents.\nCash equivalents generally consist of money market funds. Restricted cash equivalents are recorded in prepaid expenses and other and cash restricted for airport construction on our balance sheet and generally consist of money market funds, time deposits, commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit, which primarily relate to proceeds from debt issued to finance, among other things, a portion of the construction costs for our new terminal facilities at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The fair value of these cash equivalents is based on a market approach using prices generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets.\nShort-Term Investments.\nThe fair values of our short-term investments are based on a market approach using industry standard valuation techniques that incorporate observable inputs such as quoted market prices, interest rates, benchmark curves, credit ratings of the security or other observable information.\nLong-Term Investments.\nOur long-term investments that are measured at fair value primarily consist of equity investments, which are valued based on market prices or other observable transactions and inputs, and are recorded in equity investments on our balance sheet. In addition, our equity investments in private companies (such as the interests we received in Wheels Up during 2020), are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as their equity is not traded on a public exchange and our valuations incorporate certain unobservable inputs, including non-public equity issuances and forecasts provided by our investees. Our equity investments in LATAM and Grupo Aeroméxico, which have no remaining value following impairment charges recorded in 2020 due to their entry into bankruptcy proceedings, became classified as Level 3 fair value investments during 2020. Fair value measurement using unobservable inputs is inherently uncertain, and a change in significant inputs could result in different fair values. During the year ended December 31, 2020 there were no material gains or losses as a result of fair value adjustments. See Note 5, \"Investments,\" for further information on our long-term investments.\nHedge Derivatives.\nA portion of our derivative contracts are negotiated over-the-counter with counterparties without going through a public exchange. Accordingly, our fair value assessments give consideration to the risk of counterparty default (as well as our own credit risk). Such contracts are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The remainder of our hedge contracts are comprised of futures contracts, which are traded on a public exchange. These contracts are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n•\nFuel Hedge Contracts.\nOur fuel hedge portfolio consists of options, swaps and futures. Option and swap contracts are valued under income approaches using option pricing models and discounted cash flow models, respectively, based on data either readily observable in public markets, derived from public markets or provided by counterparties who regularly trade in public markets. Futures contracts and options on futures contracts are traded on a public exchange and valued based on quoted market prices.\n•\nInterest Rate Contracts.\nOur interest rate derivatives are swap contracts, which are valued based on data readily observable in public markets.\n•\nForeign Currency Exchange Contracts.\nOur foreign currency derivatives consist of forward contracts and are valued based on data readily observable in public markets.\nNOTE 5.\nINVESTMENTS\nShort-Term Investments\nAt December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of our short-term investments was $\n5.8\nbillion, which approximates cost. Of these investments, $\n4.9\nbillion are expected to mature in one year or less, with the remainder maturing during 2022. Investments with maturities beyond one year when purchased may be classified as short-term investments if they are expected to be available to support our short-term liquidity needs.\nLong-Term Investments\nWe have developed strategic relationships with a number of airlines and airline services companies through joint ventures and other forms of cooperation and support, including equity investments. Our equity investments reinforce our commitment to these relationships and generally enhance our ability to offer input to the investee on strategic issues and direction, in some cases through representation on the board of directors.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               81\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nLATAM.\nIn January 2020, we acquired\n20\n% of the shares of LATAM for $\n1.9\nbillion, or $\n16\nper share, through a tender offer as part of our plan to create a strategic alliance with LATAM. In addition, to support the establishment of the strategic alliance, we agreed to make transition payments to LATAM totaling $\n350\nmillion, of which $\n75\nmillion remains to be paid by the end of 2021. As part of our planned strategic alliance with LATAM, we also agreed to acquire\nfour\nA350 aircraft from LATAM (which agreement has subsequently been terminated, as discussed below) and assumed\n10\nof LATAM's A350 purchase commitments with Airbus for deliveries through 2025.\nThe total consideration of $\n2.3\nbillion, including the tender offer and the transition payments, was allocated in the March 2020 quarter to the shares ($\n1.1\nbillion) and to the alliance-related indefinite-lived intangible asset ($\n1.2\nbillion) based on their relative fair values. We expect to record the\n10\naircraft at cost upon delivery.\nIn May 2020, LATAM filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States bankruptcy code as the result of the impact of the pandemic on its business and, as part of LATAM's reorganization, we terminated the purchase agreement for the\nfour\nA350 aircraft from LATAM for a fee of $\n62\nmillion, which was recorded in restructuring charges in our income statement. While our ownership interest remains at\n20\n%, we no longer have significant influence with LATAM during their bankruptcy proceedings and discontinued accounting for the investment under the equity method in the June 2020 quarter and began accounting for the investment at fair value.\nDuring the June 2020 quarter, we eliminated the carrying value of our investment in LATAM and recorded expense of $\n1.1\nbillion in impairments and equity method losses within non-operating expense in our income statement. This charge reflected the recognition of both our\n20\n% share of LATAM's March 2020 quarter losses (due to the timing of information available from LATAM) and the decline in our expected realizable value for LATAM's shares following its bankruptcy filing. The impairment charge for our investment in LATAM was calculated using Level 3 fair value inputs. During the September 2020 quarter, LATAM’s debtor-in-possession financing was approved by the bankruptcy court to provide LATAM with near-term liquidity and the ability to continue progressing toward a plan of reorganization. We expect that no more than an immaterial amount will be distributed to current equity holders following the settlement of unsecured claims upon LATAM's emergence from bankruptcy. The carrying value of our investment in LATAM remains\nzero\nat December 31, 2020.\nIn May 2020, we signed a trans-American joint venture agreement with LATAM that, subject to regulatory approvals, will combine our highly complementary route networks between North and South America, with the goal of providing customers with a seamless travel experience and industry-leading connectivity. In addition, the bankruptcy court has approved the assumption of our strategic partnership agreement, which contributes to supporting the value of our $\n1.2\nbillion alliance-related indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nWe believe this alliance will generate growth opportunities, building upon Delta's and LATAM's global footprint and joint ventures. See Note 7, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets,\" for further discussion of our quantitative impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nGrupo Aeroméxico.\nIn June 2020, Grupo Aeroméxico filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States bankruptcy code as the result of the impact of the pandemic on its business. We have a non-controlling\n51\n% ownership interest in Grupo Aeroméxico, however Grupo Aeroméxico's corporate bylaws (as authorized by the Mexican Foreign Investment Commission) limit our voting interest to a maximum of\n49\n%. Therefore, we accounted for our investment under the equity method prior to Grupo Aeroméxico's bankruptcy filing.\nAs a result of Grupo Aeroméxico's bankruptcy filing, while our ownership interest has not changed, we no longer have significant influence with Grupo Aeroméxico during their bankruptcy proceedings and discontinued accounting for the investment under the equity method in the June 2020 quarter and began accounting for the investment at fair value.\nDuring the June 2020 quarter, we eliminated the carrying value of our investment in Grupo Aeroméxico and recorded expense of $\n770\nmillion in impairments and equity method losses within non-operating expense in our income statement. This charge reflected the recognition of both our\n51\n% share of Grupo Aeroméxico's June 2020 quarter losses and the decline in our expected realizable value for Grupo Aeroméxico's shares following its bankruptcy filing. The impairment charge for our investment in Grupo Aeroméxico was calculated using Level 3 fair value inputs.\nDuring the December 2020 quarter, Grupo Aeroméxico's debtor-in-possession financing was approved by the bankruptcy court to provide Grupo Aeroméxico with near-term liquidity and the ability to continue progressing toward a plan of reorganization. We expect that no more than an immaterial amount will be distributed to current equity holders following the settlement of unsecured claims upon Grupo Aeroméxico's emergence from bankruptcy. The carrying value of our investment in Grupo Aeroméxico remains\nzero\nat December 31, 2020.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               82\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn addition, we believe Grupo Aeroméxico intends to request the bankruptcy court's approval to assume our joint cooperation agreement.\nAs a result of the significantly decreased demand for air travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, LATAM and Grupo Aeroméxico are undergoing in-court restructurings. In order to support our relationships with these carriers, we have provided them with strategic and operational assistance through their restructurings. We recorded notes payable of $\n165\nmillion, which are recorded in current maturities of debt and finance leases, and receivables from those partners within other noncurrent assets as of December 31, 2020.\nGOL.\nIn 2019, we sold our ownership stake of GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes, the parent company of GOL Linhas Aéreas (operating as GOL), and have ended our commercial agreements. During 2015, in conjunction with our investment in GOL we agreed to guarantee GOL’s $\n300\nmillion\nfive\n-year term loan facility with third parties that matured in August 2020. During the September 2020 quarter, we loaned GOL $\n250\nmillion, to be used exclusively to repay the 2015 term loan. The $\n250\nmillion loan to GOL reduced our financial exposure and provides us with additional collateral while providing GOL more time to address its obligations during the pandemic. Our loan to GOL is secured by GOL’s ownership interest in Smiles, GOL’s publicly traded loyalty program, as well as other collateral. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding principal balance of the loan, which was prepaid in part during 2020 and is now scheduled to be repaid in monthly installments through June 2021, was $\n93\nmillion.\nFair Value Investments\nOur investments accounted for at fair value are summarized in the following table:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded net losses on these equity investments of\n$\n105\nmillion compared to net gains of $\n119\nmillion, including a gain from the sale of our ownership stake in GOL, during the year ended December 31, 2019 and $\n38\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2018. These results were recorded in gain/(loss) on investments in our income statement within non-operating expense and were driven by changes in stock prices, foreign currency fluctuations and other valuation techniques for investments in companies without publicly-traded shares.\nWheels Up.\nIn January 2020, we combined Delta Private Jets, our wholly owned subsidiary which provided private jet operations, with Wheels Up. This transaction resulted in a gain of $\n240\nmillion which was recorded within miscellaneous, net in our income statement in the March 2020 quarter. Upon closing, we received interests, which represented a\n24\n% equity stake in Wheels Up as of December 31, 2020, included in other investments above. We elected to record our investment using the fair value option as this is expected to better reflect the economics of our ownership interest. In February 2021, Wheels Up entered into a definitive agreement to become publicly-traded via a merger with Aspirational Consumer Lifestyle Corp. The transaction is expected to close in the June 2021 quarter.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               83\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nEquity Method Investments\nWe account for the investments listed below and certain other immaterial investments under the equity method of accounting.\n(1)\nWe have a non-controlling equity stake in Virgin Atlantic Limited, the parent company of Virgin Atlantic Airways, and similar non-controlling interests in certain affiliated Virgin Atlantic companies.\nOur equity method investments are recorded in equity investments on our balance sheet. If an equity method investment experiences a loss in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary, we will reduce our carrying value of the investment to fair value and record the loss in impairments and equity method losses in our income statement\n.\nVirgin Atlantic.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting travel restrictions and quarantines, Virgin Atlantic has incurred significant losses during 2020. In recording our\n49\n% share in Virgin Atlantic's results and based on our review of Virgin Atlantic's financial projections, in the June 2020 quarter we reduced the carrying value of our investment to\nzero\n.\nDuring the September 2020 quarter, Virgin Atlantic undertook a voluntary recapitalization process in the U.K., which was subsequently approved by its creditors, and instituted ancillary proceedings in support of that process in the U.S. Under related agreements, we recognized a note payable of $\n115\nmillion, which is recorded in current maturities of debt and finance leases, and a corresponding receivable within other noncurrent assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $\n510\nmillion in impairments and equity method losses within non-operating expense in our income statement. Under the equity method of accounting, we will track our share of Virgin Atlantic's future losses, but we will not reflect our share of their results in our financial statements until such time that our share of their earnings eliminates the losses beyond our carrying value of the investment. We continue to monitor and support Virgin Atlantic's ongoing restructuring efforts.\nEffective January 2020, we combined our separate transatlantic joint venture agreements with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic into a single\nthree\n-party transatlantic joint venture. Under the new agreement, certain measurement thresholds were reset from the previous joint venture with Virgin Atlantic, reducing the value we would have received over the original term. In consideration for this reduced value, we entered into a transition agreement with Virgin Atlantic, which would have resulted in payments to us in future periods. However, as of December 31, 2020, based on our assessment of collectability, we do not have any assets or liabilities recorded on our balance sheet related to this transition agreement.\nUnifi Aviation.\nWe have a\n49\n% ownership interest in AirCo Aviation Services, LLC, which together with its subsidiaries is operating as Unifi Aviation. Our share of Unifi Aviation's financial results is recorded in contracted services in our income statement as this entity is integral to the operations of our business and the services provided by Unifi Aviation are also recorded in contracted services in our income statement. Based on discussions with Unifi Aviation's management and review of their liquidity and financial projections, we do not believe our investment is other than temporarily impaired as we have the intent and ability to retain this investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in value. However, we will continue to monitor the continuing effects of the pandemic and self-help measures Unifi Aviation executes.\nWe also have an investment in JFK IAT Member LLC which is accounted for under the equity method and is discussed further in Note 10, \"Airport Redevelopment.\"\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               84\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nReceivables from Investees and Other Airlines\nBased on our assessment of collectability, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded approximately $\n100\nmillion of reserves against outstanding receivables from LATAM, Grupo Aeroméxico, GOL, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Australia and others. These reserves reflect our expected recoveries given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our investees and other airlines, and their restructuring efforts or recent bankruptcy filings. In determining the appropriate amount to reserve, we also considered the valuation of and our ability to realize the value of any collateral associated with each receivable. The reserves are recorded within accounts receivable, net or prepaid expenses and other on our balance sheet and within restructuring charges in our income statement.\nNOTE 6.\nDERIVATIVES AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nChanges in fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations. In an effort to manage our exposure to these risks, we may enter into derivative contracts and adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change. We recognize derivative contracts at fair value on our balance sheets. Cash flows associated with purchasing and settling hedge contracts generally are classified as operating cash flows.\nFuel Price Risk\nOur derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to Monroe’s inventory. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, fuel hedges did not have a significant impact in our income statement.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our debt obligations. Market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings, respectively, from an increase in interest rates.\nIn an effort to manage our exposure to the risk associated with our variable rate debt, we periodically enter into interest rate swaps. We designate interest rate contracts used to convert the interest rate exposure on a portion of our debt portfolio from a floating rate to a fixed rate as cash flow hedges, while those contracts converting our interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a floating rate are designated as fair value hedges.\nWe also have exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates associated with our cash and cash equivalents and benefit plan obligations. Market risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents relates to the potential decline in interest income from a decrease in interest rates. Pension, postretirement, postemployment and worker's compensation obligation risk relates to the potential increase in our future obligations and expenses from a decrease in interest rates used to discount these obligations.\nIn the March 2020 quarter, we unwound a majority of our interest rate swap contracts. The unwind of these contracts generated approximately $\n100\nmillion of cash in the March 2020 quarter. Additionally, in January 2021 we unwound our remaining interest rate swap contract. The unwind of this contract generated approximately $\n20\nmillion of cash in January 2021. These gains are being reflected in our income statement over the remaining term of the related debt agreements.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue, expense and equity investments denominated in foreign currencies. To manage exchange rate risk, we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts.\nIn November 2019, we entered into a three and a half-year U.S. dollar-South Korean won (\"KRW\") cross currency swap with a notional value of\n177\nbillion KRW. This swap is intended to mitigate foreign currency volatility resulting from our KRW-denominated investment in Hanjin-KAL. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an unrealized loss on this swap of $\n10\nmillion, which is reflected in gain/(loss) on investments, net within non-operating expense.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               85\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2020, these amounts include the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments remaining for which hedge accounting has been discontinued of approximately $\n76\nmillion.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               86\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities\nWe have master netting arrangements with our counterparties giving us the right to offset hedge assets and liabilities. However, we have elected not to offset the fair value positions recorded on our balance sheets.\nThe following table shows the net fair value of our counterparty positions had we elected to offset.\nNot Designated Hedge Gains (Losses)\nGains (losses) related to our foreign currency exchange and fuel contracts are as follows:\nCredit Risk\nTo manage credit risk associated with our fuel price, interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs, we evaluate counterparties based on several criteria including their credit ratings and limit our exposure to any one counterparty.\nOur hedge contracts often contain margin funding requirements. The margin funding requirements may cause us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change. Due to the fair value position of our hedge contracts, we held or posted\nno\nmargin as of December 31, 2020 and posted margin of $\n34\nmillion as of December 31, 2019.\nAccounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from credit card companies from the sale of passenger tickets, ancillary businesses and refinery sales and other companies for the purchase of miles under the loyalty program. The credit risk associated with these receivables is minimal. See Note 5, \"Investments,\" for further information on our receivables from our investees and other airlines.\nSelf-Insurance Risk\nWe self-insure a portion of our losses from claims related to workers' compensation, environmental issues, property damage, medical insurance for employees, healthcare for retirees, disability and general liability. Losses are accrued based on an estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred, using independent actuarial reviews based on standard industry practices and our historical experience.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               87\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 7.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nOur goodwill and identifiable intangible assets relate to the airline segment. We apply a fair value-based impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis (as of October 1) and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. We assess the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under a qualitative approach, we consider various market factors, including certain of the key assumptions listed below. We analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the asset's fair value and the amount of the impairment. Under a quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset incorporating the key assumptions listed below into our calculation.\nWe value goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily using market and income approach valuation techniques. These measurements include the following key assumptions (1) forecasted revenues, expenses and cash flows, including the duration and extent of impact to our business and our alliance partners from the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) current discount rates, (3) observable market transactions and (4) anticipated changes to the regulatory environment (e.g., diminished slot access, additional Open Skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals). These assumptions are consistent with those that hypothetical market participants would use. Because we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates. We recognize an impairment charge if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.\nChanges in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinite-lived to definite-lived. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs (primarily related to fuel and employees), (3) lower passenger demand as a result of weakened U.S. and global economies, global pandemics or other factors, (4) interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike, terrorist attack or other reasons, (5) changes to the regulatory environment (e.g., diminished slot access, additional Open Skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals), (6) competitive changes by other airlines and (7) strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets.\nIndefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist of routes, slots, the Delta tradename and assets related to alliances and collaborative arrangements. Definite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements and are amortized on a straight-line basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements. Costs incurred to renew or extend the term of an intangible asset are expensed as incurred.\nAs a result of the significant impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our market capitalization, profitability and overall travel demand, we performed a quantitative valuation of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during 2020.\nOur December 2020 quarter quantitative impairment tests of goodwill and intangibles concluded that there was no indication of impairment as the fair value exceeded our carrying value:\n(1)\nThe reduction in goodwill relates to the combination of Delta Private Jets with Wheels Up in the March 2020 quart\ner. See Note 5, \"Investments,\" for more information on this transaction.\n(2)\nAs part of our strategic alliance with and investment in LATAM, we have recorded an alliance-related indefinite-lived intangible asset of $\n1.2\nbillion, which was not reflected in the December 31, 2019 balance.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               88\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nInternational Routes and Slots.\nOur international routes and slots primarily relate to Pacific route authorities and slots at capacity-constrained airports in Asia, and slots at London-Heathrow airport.\nAirline Alliances.\nOur airline alliances intangible assets primarily relate to our commercial agreements with LATAM and our SkyTeam partners.\nDomestic Slots.\nOur domestic slots primarily relate to our slots at New York-LaGuardia and Washington-Reagan National airports.\nBased on our impairment assessment as of our annual testing date of October 1, we determined that our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired. However, there are a number of uncertainties including how long conditions related to the pandemic will persist, when effective vaccines will be broadly available, when vaccination will be widespread globally, when travel advisories and restrictions will be lifted, what additional measures may be introduced by governments or private parties or what effect any such additional measures may have on air travel and our business. Any measure that requires or encourages potential travelers to stay in their homes, engage in social distancing or avoid larger gatherings of people is highly likely to be harmful to the air travel industry in general, and consequently our business, as these measures could delay the widespread return of demand for air travel.\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense was $\n10\nmillion, $\n11\nmillion and $\n17\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Based on our definite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2020, we estimate that we will incur approximately $\n9\nmillion of amortization expense annually from 2021 through 2025.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               89\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 8.\nDEBT\nThe following table summarizes our debt as of the dates indicated below:\n(1)\nSee Note 2, \"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,\" for further discussion of the terms, including the applicable interest rate.\n(2)\nDue in installments.\n(3)\nCertain aircraft and other financings are comprised of variable rate debt. All variable rates are equal to LIBOR (generally subject to a floor) or another index rate, in each case plus a specified margin.\n2020 Unsecured Notes\nIn the June 2020 quarter, we issued $\n1.3\nbillion in aggregate principal amount of\n7.375\n% unsecured notes due 2026. The unsecured notes are equal in right of payment with our other unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to future subordinated debt. The unsecured notes also contain event of default provisions consistent with those in our other recent unsecured debt offerings.\nUnsecured CARES Act Payroll Support Program Loan\nDuring 2020, we entered into a promissory note for the $\n1.6\nbillion CARES Act payroll support program loan and issued warrants to acquire more than\n6.7\nmillion shares of Delta common stock under the program in connection with the promissory note. We have recorded the value of the promissory note and warrants on a relative fair value basis as $\n1.5\nbillion of noncurrent debt, net of discount, and $\n114\nmillion in additional paid in capital, respectively. See Note 2, \"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,\" for further discussion of the terms of the payroll support program loan.\nIn January 2021, we issued a promissory note for approximately $\n400\nmillion with respect to the term loan portion of the initial funds received from the payroll support program extension and issued warrants to acquire approximately\n1\nmillion shares of Delta common stock under the program as discussed in Note 2, \"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.\" The balance of the promissory note is expected to increase to approximately $\n830\nmillion and the remaining warrants issued during the March 2021 quarter when we receive the remaining $\n1.5\nbillion in expected funding under the payroll support program extension.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               90\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n2020 SkyMiles Financing\nIn the September 2020 quarter, Delta and SkyMiles IP Ltd. (\"SMIP\"), an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Delta, issued $\n2.5\nbillion in principal amount of\n4.500\n% senior secured notes due 2025 and $\n3.5\nbillion in principal amount of\n4.750\n% senior secured notes due 2028 (collectively, the “SkyMiles Notes”). Concurrently with the issuance of the SkyMiles Notes, Delta and SMIP entered into a term loan credit agreement and borrowed $\n3.0\nbillion (the “SkyMiles Term Loan” and together with the SkyMiles Notes, the “SkyMiles Debt”). The SkyMiles Term Loan matures in October 2027 and bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR (but not less than\n1.0\n% per annum), plus a margin of\n3.75\n% per year.\nThe SkyMiles Debt is guaranteed by three other Delta subsidiaries that are also exempted companies incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands, including SkyMiles IP Finance Ltd. (\"SMIF\"). The SkyMiles Debt is secured by a first-priority security interest in certain of our co-branding, partnering or similar agreements relating to the SkyMiles program (including all payments thereunder), rights under certain intercompany agreements relating to the SkyMiles program, certain rights under our SkyMiles program, certain deposit accounts that receive revenue under our SkyMiles agreements, the equity of SMIP and substantially all other assets of SMIP and SMIF. The assets and credit of SMIP and the Cayman entity guarantors are not available to satisfy obligations, including indebtedness, of Delta or our subsidiaries other than with respect to the SkyMiles Debt and any permissible priority lien or junior lien debt subsequently incurred.\n2020 Senior Secured Notes and Term Loan\nIn the June 2020 quarter, we issued $\n3.5\nbillion of senior secured notes and entered into a $\n1.5\nbillion term loan secured by certain slots, gates and routes. The senior secured notes bear interest at an annual rate of\n7.00\n% and mature in May 2025. The term loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a specified margin and is subject to principal payments of\n1\n% per year, payable quarterly beginning in September 2020, with the balance due in April 2023.\n2018 Revolving Credit Facility\nIn the June 2020 quarter, we amended the 2018 revolving credit facility agreement to be secured by our Pacific route authorities and certain related assets. Additionally, the revolving credit facility was amended to extend the maturities of $\n1.3\nbillion of the revolver previously due in April 2021 to April 2022 and to include a minimum liquidity covenant, as discussed further below. In October 2020, we repaid the borrowings under the revolving credit facility.\n2020 Secured Term Loan Facility\nIn the March 2020 quarter, we entered into a $\n2.7\nbillion\n364\n-day secured term loan facility, and we increased the borrowings thereunder to $\n3.0\nbillion in April 2020. Borrowings under this facility were secured by certain aircraft. In October 2020, we repaid all borrowings under, and terminated, this facility.\n2020-1 EETC\nWe completed a $\n1.0\nbillion offering of Class AA and A Pass Through Certificates, Series 2020-1 (\"2020-1 EETC\") utilizing a pass through trust during the March 2020 quarter. The proceeds of this issuance were used to repay unsecured notes that matured in the March 2020 quarter. In the June 2020 quarter, we issued an additional $\n135\nmillion of Class B certificates.\nThe details of the 2020-1 EETC, which is secured by\n33\naircraft, are shown in the table below:\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               91\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n2019-1 EETC\nIn the June 2020 quarter, we issued an additional $\n108\nmillion of certificates under the 2019-1 EETC offering initially completed in March 2019. The additional certificates were issued as 2019-1 Class B Certificates with a fixed interest rate of\n8.00\n% and mature in April 2023.\nNew York Transportation Development Corporation (\"NYTDC\") Special Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2020\nIn the September 2020 quarter, the NYTDC issued Special Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2020 (the \"Series 2020 Bonds\") in the aggregate principal amount of $\n1.5\nbillion. We entered into loan agreements with the NYTDC to use the proceeds from the Series 2020 Bonds to finance a portion of the costs of the construction project that is currently in process at LaGuardia Airport, consisting of the demolition of existing Terminals C and D, the design and construction of new terminal facilities, the payment of capitalized interest on the Series 2020 Bonds and on a portion of the Special Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2018, and the payment of costs related to issuance of the Series 2020 Bonds. The proceeds from the Series 2020 Bonds are recorded in cash restricted for airport construction on our balance sheet, along with the remaining proceeds of the Series 2018 Bonds. See Note 10, \"Airport Redevelopment,\" for further information on our LaGuardia Airport project.\nWe are required to pay debt service on the Series 2020 Bonds through payments under loan agreements with NYTDC, and we have guaranteed the Series 2020 Bonds.\nAvailability Under Revolving Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $\n2.6\nbillion undrawn and available under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, we had outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2020, including approximately\n$\n300\nmillion\nthat reduced the availability under our revolvers and approximately\n$\n300\nmillion that did not affect the availability under our revolvers.\nFair Value of Debt\nMarket risk associated with our fixed- and variable-rate debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings, respectively, from an increase in interest rates.\nThe fair value of debt, shown below, is principally based on reported market values, recently completed market transactions and estimates based on interest rates, maturities, credit risk and underlying collateral. Debt is primarily classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nCovenants\nOur debt agreements contain various affirmative, negative and financial covenants. For example, our credit facilities and our SkyMiles financing agreements, contain, among other things, a minimum liquidity covenant. The minimum liquidity covenant requires us to maintain at least $\n2.0\nbillion of liquidity (defined as cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities). Certain of our debt agreements also include collateral coverage ratios and limit our ability to (1) incur liens under certain circumstances, (2) dispose of collateral, (3) engage in mergers and consolidations or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and (4) pay dividends or repurchase our common stock through September 2021. Our SkyMiles financing agreements include a debt service coverage ratio and also restrict our ability to, among other things, (1) modify the terms of the SkyMiles program, or otherwise change the policies and procedures of the SkyMiles program, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially impair repayment of the SkyMiles Debt, (2) sell pre-paid miles in excess of $\n550\nmillion in the aggregate and (3) terminate or materially modify the intercompany arrangements governing the relationship between Delta and SMIP with respect to the SkyMiles program.\nEach of these restrictions, however, is subject to certain exceptions and qualifications that are set forth in these debt agreements. We were in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements at December 31, 2020.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               92\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFuture Maturities\nThe following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our debt for the years succeeding December 31, 2020:\nNOTE 9.\nLEASES\nWe lease property and equipment under finance and operating leases. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, we record the related asset and obligation at the present value of lease payments over the term. Many of our leases include rental escalation clauses, renewal options and/or termination options that are factored into our determination of lease payments when appropriate. We do not separate lease and nonlease components of contracts, except for regional aircraft and information technology (\"IT\") assets as discussed below.\nWhen available, we use the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value; however, we have an insignificant number of leases representing an immaterial portion of our lease liability that provide readily determinable implicit rates. When the rate implicit in the lease is not available, we use our incremental borrowing rate, which is based on the estimated interest rate for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease at commencement date.\nSome of our aircraft lease agreements include provisions for residual value guarantees. These provisions primarily relate to our regional aircraft and the amounts are not significant. We do not have other forms of variable interests with the lessors of our leased assets, other than at New York-JFK, in which we are not the primary beneficiary as discussed in Note 10, \"Airport Redevelopment,\" and with respect to one lessor, in which we have a variable interest in certain immaterial aircraft leases, that we have consolidated.\nAircraft\nAs of December 31, 2020, including aircraft operated by our regional carriers, we leased\n353\naircraft, of which\n145\nwere under finance leases and\n208\nwere operating leases. Our aircraft leases had remaining lease terms of\none month\nto\n15\nyears.\nIn addition, we have regional aircraft leases that are embedded within our capacity purchase agreements and included in the operating right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability. We allocated the consideration in each capacity purchase agreement to the lease and nonlease components based on their relative standalone value. Lease components of these agreements consist of\n125\naircraft as of December 31, 2020 and nonlease components primarily consist of flight operations, in-flight and maintenance services. We determined our best estimate of the standalone value of the individual components by considering observable information including rates paid by our wholly owned subsidiary, Endeavor Air, Inc., and rates published by independent valuation firms. See Note 12, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" for additional information about our capacity purchase agreements.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               93\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nAirport Facilities\nOur facility leases are primarily for space at approximately\n300\nairports around the world that we serve. These leases reflect our use of airport terminals, office space, cargo warehouses and maintenance facilities. We generally lease space from government agencies that control the use of the airport, and as a result, these leases are classified as operating leases. The remaining lease terms vary from\none month\nto\n30\nyears. At the majority of the U.S. airports, the lease rates depend on airport operating costs or use of the facilities and are reset at least annually. Because of the variable nature of the rates, these leases are not recorded on our balance sheet as a ROU asset and lease liability.\nSome airport facilities have fixed payment schedules, the most significant of which are New York-LaGuardia and New York-JFK. For those airport leases, we have recorded a ROU asset and lease liability representing the fixed component of the lease payment. See Note 10, \"Airport Redevelopment,\" for more information on our significant airport redevelopment projects.\nOther Ground Property and Equipment\nWe lease certain IT assets (including servers, mainframes, etc.), ground support equipment (including tugs, tractors, fuel trucks and de-icers), and various other equipment. The remaining lease terms range from\none month\nto\nnine years\n. Certain leased assets are embedded within various ground and IT service agreements. For ground service contracts, we have elected to include both the lease and nonlease components in the lease asset and lease liability balances on our balance sheet. For IT service contracts, we have elected to separate the lease and nonlease components and only the lease components are included in the lease asset and lease liability balances on our balance sheet. The amounts of these lease and nonlease components are not significant.\nSale-Leaseback Transactions\nIn 2020, we entered into $\n2.8\nbillion of sale-leaseback transactions for\n85\naircraft including\n25\nA321-200s,\n25\nA220-100s,\n23\nCRJ-900s,\n10\n737-900ERs and\ntwo\nA330-900s. Of these transactions,\n74\ndid not qualify as a sale as they are finance leases or have an option to repurchase at a stated price. The assets associated with these transactions remain on our balance sheet within property and equipment, net and we recorded the related liabilities under the lease. These liabilities are classified within other accrued or other noncurrent liabilities on our balance sheet. The cash proceeds are treated as financing inflows on the cash flows statement.\nThe other\n11\ntransactions qualified as sales, generating an immaterial loss, and the associated assets were removed from our balance sheet within property and equipment, net and recorded within ROU assets. The liabilities are recorded within current maturities of operating leases and noncurrent operating leases on our balance sheet. The cash proceeds are treated as investing cash inflows on the cash flows statement.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               94\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nLease Position\nThe table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet.\nLease Costs\nThe table below presents certain information related to the lease costs for finance and operating leases.\n(1)\nExpenses are classified within aircraft rent, landing fees and other rents and regional carriers expense, excluding fuel on the income statement. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $\n187\nmillion and $\n50\nmillion of the operating and variable lease costs, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, $\n174\nmillion and $\n64\nmillion of the operating and variable lease costs, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2018, $\n150\nmillion, $\n18\nmillion and $\n48\nmillion of the operating, short-term and variable lease costs, respectively, are attributable to our regional carriers.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               95\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOther Information\nThe table below presents supplemental cash flow information related to leases.\nUndiscounted Cash Flows\nThe table below reconciles the undiscounted cash flows for each of the first five years and total of the remaining years to the finance lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities recorded on the balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had additional leases that had not yet commenced of $\n734\nmillion. These leases will commence in 2021 to 2024 with lease terms of\n7\nto\n12\nyears.\nNOTE 10.\nAIRPORT REDEVELOPMENT\nNew York-JFK Airport\nIn 2015, we completed two phases of redevelopment at New York-JFK's Terminal 4 to facilitate convenient connections for our passengers and improve coordination with our SkyTeam alliance partners. Terminal 4 is operated by JFK International Air Terminal LLC (\"IAT\"), a private party, under its lease with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (\"Port Authority\"). In December 2010, we entered into a\n33\n-year agreement with IAT (\"Sublease\") to sublease space in Terminal 4. Also, in 2010, the Port Authority issued approximately $\n800\nmillion principal amount of special project bonds (the \"Series 8 Bonds\") to fund the majority of the project. In December 2020, the NYTDC issued approximately $\n611\nmillion principal amount of special project bonds to refinance the outstanding balance of the Series 8 Bonds. We have recognized a ROU asset and lease liability representing the fixed component of the lease payments for this facility.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               96\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have an equity method investment in JFK IAT Member LLC, which owns IAT, our sublessor at Terminal 4. The Sublease requires us to pay certain fixed management fees. We determined the investment is a variable interest entity and assessed whether we have a controlling financial interest in IAT. Our rights under the Sublease, with respect to management of Terminal 4, are consistent with rights granted to an anchor tenant under a standard airport lease. Accordingly, we do not consolidate this entity in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe continue to plan for further expansion of Terminal 4, however changes in the JFK market due to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to reevaluate our original plan to expand the terminal by 16 gates. We are working with the Port Authority and IAT to evaluate our options and determine the optimal size, scope and phasing of the expansion.\nLos Angeles International Airport (\"LAX\")\nWe executed a modified lease agreement during 2016 with the City of Los Angeles (the \"City\"), which owns and operates LAX, and announced plans to modernize, upgrade and\nprovide post-security connection to Terminals 2 and 3. Construction is underway, which includes a new centralized ticketing and arrival hall, a new security checkpoint, core infrastructure to support the City's planned airport people mover, ramp improvements and a post-security connector to the north side of the Tom Bradley International Terminal.\nGiven reduced passenger volumes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have accelerated the construction schedule for this project. Additionally, in 2020, we enhanced the project’s scope to include a more customer-friendly design of Terminal 3, a Delta One lounge and expanded Delta Sky Club, and baggage system upgrades designed to increase the terminals’ operational efficiency going forward. Construction is expected to be completed by 2023.\nThe project is expected to cost approximately $\n2.3\nbillion. A substantial majority of the project costs are being funded through the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation (\"RAIC\"), a California public benefit corporation, using an $\n800\nmillion revolving credit facility provided by a group of lenders. The credit facility was executed during 2017 and amended in 2020, and we have guaranteed the obligations of the RAIC under the credit facility. Loans made under the credit facility are being repaid with the proceeds from the City’s purchase of completed project assets. Under the lease agreement and subsequent project component approvals by the City's Board of Airport Commissioners, the City has appropriated to date approximately $\n1.8\nbillion to purchase completed project assets, representing the maximum allowable reimbursement by the City. Costs incurred in excess of the $\n1.8\nbillion maximum will not be reimbursed by the City. We currently expect our net project costs to be approximately $\n500\nmillion, of which approximately $\n200\nmillion has been reflected as investing activities in our cash flows statement since the project started in 2017. In 2020, $\n315\nmillion was spent on this project, with $\n293\nmillion paid by the credit facility and $\n22\nmillion paid directly by Delta.\nBased on our assessment of the project, we concluded that we do not control the underlying assets being constructed, and therefore, we do not have the project asset or related obligation recorded on our balance sheet.\nNew York-LaGuardia Airport\nAs part of the terminal redevelopment project at LaGuardia Airport, we are partnering with the Port Authority to replace Terminals C and D with a new state-of-the-art terminal facility consisting of 37 gates across four concourses connected to a central headhouse. The terminal will feature a new, larger Delta Sky Club, wider concourses, more gate seating and 75 percent more concessions space than the existing terminals. The facility will also offer direct access between the parking garage and terminal and improved roadways and drop-off/pick-up areas. The design of the new terminal will integrate sustainable technologies and improvements in energy efficiency. Construction will be phased to limit passenger inconvenience and is expected to be completed by 2026.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               97\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn connection with the redevelopment, during 2017, we entered into an amended and restated terminal lease with the Port Authority with a term through 2050. Pursuant to the lease agreement, as amended to date, we will (1) fund (through debt issuance and existing cash) and undertake the design, management and construction of the terminal and certain off-premises supporting facilities, (2) receive a Port Authority contribution of $\n481\nmillion to facilitate construction of the terminal and other supporting infrastructure, (3) be responsible for all operations and maintenance during the term of the lease and (4) have preferential rights to all gates in the terminal subject to Port Authority requirements with respect to accommodation of designated carriers. We currently expect our net project cost to be approximately $\n3.5\nbillion and we bear the risks of project construction, including any potential cost over-runs. Using funding primarily provided by existing financing arrangements, we spent approximately $\n600\nmillion during 2020, bringing the total amount spent on the project to date to approximately $\n1.5\nbillion. See Note 8, \"Debt,\" for additional information on the debt related to this redevelopment project, NYTDC Special Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2018 and NYTDC Special Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2020.\nIn 2019, we opened Concourse G, the first of the four new concourses housing seven of the 37 new gates. Not only did it deliver the first direct impact to the Delta passenger experience, it also represented the first major phasing milestone. The next major milestone will be the opening of the headhouse and Concourse E, which is scheduled for 2022.\nAs we are funding the majority of the LaGuardia redevelopment project, we account for the related assets as leasehold improvements. We entered into loan agreements to fund a portion of the construction, which are recorded on our balance sheet as debt with the proceeds reflected as restricted cash.\nNOTE 11.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nWe sponsor defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, healthcare plans and disability and survivorship plans for eligible employees and retirees and their eligible family members.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans.\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. These plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules (\"Alternative Funding Rules\") for defined benefit plans that are frozen. We elected the Alternative Funding Rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17-year period and is calculated using an\n8.85\n% discount rate until the 17-year period expires for all frozen defined benefit plans by the end of 2024. We have no minimum funding requirements in 2021, but we plan to voluntarily contribute at least $\n500\nmillion to these plans during 2021.\nDefined Contribution Pension Plans.\nWe sponsor several defined contribution plans. These plans generally cover different employee groups and employer contributions vary by plan. The costs associated with our defined contribution pension plans were approximately $\n805\nmillion, $\n1.0\nbillion and $\n925\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPostretirement Healthcare Plans.\nWe sponsor healthcare plans that provide benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents who are under age\n65\n. We have generally eliminated company-paid post age\n65\nhealthcare coverage, except for (1) subsidies available to a limited group of retirees and their dependents, (2) a group of retirees who retired prior to 1987 and (3) retiree medical accounts which provide a fixed dollar amount to eligible employees who retired in 2012 or in 2020. Benefits under these plans are funded from current assets and employee contributions.\nDuring the September 2020 quarter, we remeasured our postretirement healthcare obligation to account for the retiree medical accounts provided to eligible participants in our voluntary early retirement and separation programs (\"voluntary programs\"). As a result, we recorded a $\n1.3\nbillion special termination benefit charge and increased our postretirement healthcare obligation by $\n1.3\nbillion.\nPostemployment Plans.\nWe provide certain other welfare benefits to eligible former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement, primarily as part of the disability and survivorship plans. Substantially all employees are eligible for benefits under these plans in the event of death and/or disability.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               98\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nBenefit Obligations, Fair Value of Plan Assets and Funded Status\n(1)\nAt the end of each year presented, our accumulated benefit obligations for our pension plans are equal to the benefit obligations shown above.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, net actuarial losses increased our benefit obligation primarily due to the decrease in discount rates\n.\nThese gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and reflected in the table below.\nBalance Sheet Position\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               99\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNet Periodic (Benefit) Cost\nService cost is recorded in salaries and related costs in the income statement. Special termination benefits are recorded in restructuring charges, while all other components are recorded within miscellaneous, net under non-operating expense.\nAssumptions\nWe used the following actuarial assumptions to determine our benefit obligations and our net periodic benefit cost for the periods presented:\n(1)\nFuture employee compensation levels do not impact our frozen defined benefit pension plans or other postretirement plans and impact only a small portion of our other postemployment obligation.\n(2)\nHealthcare cost trend rate is assumed to decline gradually to\n5.00\n% by 2026 and remain unchanged thereafter.\nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return.\nOur expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data. Modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets. We review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually. Our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a long-term return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan. This is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity, fixed income, real assets, hedge funds and other assets and instruments. Our weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets for net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2020 was\n8.97\n%.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               100\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nLife Expectancy\n. Changes in life expectancy may significantly impact our benefit obligations and future net periodic benefit cost. We use the Society of Actuaries (\"SOA\") published mortality data and other publicly available information to develop our best estimate of life expectancy. The SOA publishes updated mortality tables for U.S. plans and updated improvement scales. Each year we consider updates by the SOA in setting our mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations.\nBenefit Payments\nBenefit payments in the table below are based on the same assumptions used to measure the related benefit obligations. Actual benefit payments may vary significantly from these estimates. Benefits earned under our pension plans and certain postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid from funded benefit plan trusts, while our other postretirement benefits are funded from current assets.\nThe following table summarizes the benefit payments that are expected to be paid in the years ending December 31:\nPlan Assets\nWe have adopted and implemented investment policies for our defined benefit pension plans that incorporate strategic asset allocation mixes intended to best meet the plans' long-term obligations, while maintaining an appropriate level of risk and liquidity. These asset portfolios employ a diversified mix of investments, which are reviewed periodically. Active management strategies are utilized where feasible in an effort to realize investment returns in excess of market indices. Derivatives in the plans are primarily used to manage risk and gain asset class exposure while still maintaining liquidity. As part of these strategies, the plans are required to hold cash collateral associated with certain derivatives. Our investment strategies target a mix of\n30\n-\n50\n% growth-seeking assets,\n25\n-\n35\n% income-generating assets and\n30\n-\n40\n% risk-diversifying assets. Risk diversifying assets include hedged mandates implementing long-short, market neutral and relative value strategies that invest primarily in publicly-traded equity, fixed income, foreign currency and commodity securities and are used to improve the impact of active management on the plans.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               101\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nBenefit Plan Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nBenefit Plan Assets.\nBenefit plan assets relate to our defined benefit pension plans and certain of our postemployment benefit plans. These investments are presented net of the related benefit obligation in pension, postretirement and related benefits on the balance sheets. See Note 4, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" for a description of the levels within the fair value hierarchy and associated valuation techniques used to measure fair value.\nThe following table shows our benefit plan assets by asset class.\n(1)\nInvestments that were measured at NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\nEquities and Equity-Related Instruments.\nThese investments include common stock and equity-related instruments. Common stock is valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. Equity-related instruments include investments in securities traded on exchanges, including listed futures and options, which are valued at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or, if not available, the last reported bid prices. Over-the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable, generally broker quotes.\nDelta Common Stock.\nThe Delta common stock investment is managed by an independent fiduciary.\nCash Equivalents.\nThese investments primarily consist of high-quality, short-term obligations that are a part of institutional money market mutual funds that are valued using current market quotations or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions.\nFixed Income and Fixed Income-Related Instruments.\nThese investments include corporate bonds, government bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset-backed securities, and are generally valued at the bid price or the average of the bid and ask price. Prices are based on pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or broker quotes. Fixed income-related instruments include investments in securities traded on exchanges, including listed futures and options, which are valued at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year, or if not available, the last reported bid prices. Over-the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable, generally broker quotes.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               102\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table summarizes investments measured at fair value based on NAV per share as a practical expedient:\n(1)\nWeekly, semi-monthly, monthly\n(2)\nSemi-annually and annually\n(3)\nVarious. Includes funds with weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, quarterly and custom redemption frequencies as well as funds with a redemption window following the anniversary of the initial investment.\n(4)\nUnfunded commitments were $\n916\nmillion for commingled funds, private equity and private equity-related instruments, $\n264\nmillion for fixed income and fixed income-related instruments and $\n181\nmillion for real assets at December 31, 2020.\nHedge Funds and Hedge Fund-Related Strategies.\nThese investments are primarily made through shares of limited partnerships or similar structures for which a liquid secondary market does not exist.\nCommingled Funds, Private Equity and Private Equity-Related Instruments.\nThese investments include commingled funds invested in common stock, as well as private equity and private equity-related instruments. Commingled funds are valued based on quoted market prices of the underlying assets owned by the fund. Private equity and private equity-related strategies are typically valued quarterly by the fund managers using valuation models where one or more of the significant inputs into the model cannot be observed and which require the development of assumptions.\nFixed Income and Fixed Income-Related Instruments.\nThese investments include commingled funds invested in debt obligations. Commingled funds are valued based on quoted market prices of the underlying assets owned by the fund. Private fixed income strategies are typically valued monthly or quarterly by the fund managers or third-party valuation agents using valuation models where one or more of significant inputs into the model cannot be observed and which require the development of assumptions.\nReal Assets.\nThese investments include real estate, energy, timberland, agriculture and infrastructure. The valuation of real assets requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices as well as the inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of these assets. Real assets are typically valued quarterly by the fund managers using valuation models where one or more of the significant inputs into the model cannot be observed and which require the development of assumptions.\nOther.\nPrimarily includes globally-diversified, risk-managed commingled funds consisting mainly of equity, fixed income and commodity exposures.\nOn an annual basis we assess the potential for adjustments to the fair value of all investments. These investments valued using NAV as a practical expedient are typically valued on a monthly or quarterly basis by third-party administrators, valuation agents or fund managers with an annual audit performed by an independent third party, but certain of these investments have a lag in the availability of data. This primarily applies to private equity, private equity-related strategies and real assets. We solicit valuation updates from the investment fund managers and use their information and corroborating data from public markets to determine any needed fair value adjustments.\nOther\nWe also sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees in certain foreign countries. These plans did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements in any period presented.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               103\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nVoluntary Programs\nDuring the June 2020 quarter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we announced the voluntary programs, which primarily applied to eligible U.S. merit, ground and flight attendant and pilot employees. The employees electing to participate in the voluntary programs were eligible for separation payments, continued healthcare benefits and certain participants will receive retiree medical accounts. The election and revocation windows for these programs closed during the September 2020 quarter with approximately\n18,000\nemployees electing to participate. We recorded $\n3.4\nbillion in restructuring charges in our income statement associated with these programs and other employee benefit charges during 2020, including $\n1.3\nbillion of special termination benefits (discussed above). The remainder of the restructuring charge primarily relates to separation payments and healthcare benefits. Approximately $\n720\nmillion was disbursed in cash payments to participants in the voluntary programs during 2020. An additional approximately $\n250\nmillion of cash payments were disbursed during 2020 related to unused vacation and other benefits, which were accrued prior to the voluntary programs charge. Accruals related to the voluntary programs are primarily recorded in pension, postretirement and related benefits, other noncurrent liabilities, other accrued liabilities and accrued salaries and related benefits on our balance sheet.\nProfit Sharing Program\nOur broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees. In determining the amount of profit sharing, the program defines profit as pre-tax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items. For the year ended December 31, 2020 we recorded\nno\nexpense and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded expenses of $\n1.6\nbillion and $\n1.3\nbillion under the profit sharing program, respectively.\nNOTE 12.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nAircraft Purchase Commitments\nIn 2020, we restructured our aircraft order books with Airbus and MHI RJ Aviation Group (manufacturer of CRJ aircraft) in an effort to better match the timing of aircraft deliveries with our network and financial needs over the next several years. The restructuring reduced our aircraft purchase commitments by more than $\n2\nbillion in 2020 and by more than $\n5\nbillion through 2022. The shift in delivery timing is intended to allow us to continue simplifying and modernizing our fleet while maintaining our Airbus order book.\nOur future aircraft purchase commitments totaled approximately $\n13.9\nbillion at December 31, 2020:\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               104\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur future aircraft purchase commitments included the following aircraft at December 31, 2020:\n(1)\nIncludes\none\nA330-900neo lease commitment in 2021 incremental to our order book with Airbus.\nLATAM A350 Commitments\nWe have assumed\n10\nof LATAM's A350 purchase commitments from Airbus, with deliveries through 2025, which are included as purchase commitments in the above table. We had agreed to acquire\nfour\nA350 aircraft from LATAM, but terminated the purchase agreement for a fee of $\n62\nmillion during the June 2020 quarter. See Note 5, \"Investments,\" for further information on our strategic alliance with LATAM.\nContract Carrier Agreements\nWe have contract carrier agreements with regional carriers expiring from 2021 to 2029.\nCapacity Purchase Agreements\n. Our regional carriers primarily operate for us under capacity purchase agreements. Under these agreements, the regional carriers operate some or all of their aircraft using our flight designator codes, and we control the scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing and seat inventories of those aircraft and retain the revenues associated with those flights. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services.\nThe following table shows our minimum obligations under our existing capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. The obligations set forth in the table contemplate minimum levels of flying by the regional carriers under the respective agreements and also reflect assumptions regarding certain costs associated with the minimum levels of flying such as the cost of fuel, labor, maintenance, insurance, catering, property tax and landing fees.\nAccordingly, our actual payments under these agreements could differ materially from the minimum fixed obligations set forth in the table below.\n(1)\nThese amounts exclude contract carrier payments accounted for as operating leases of aircraft, which are described in Note 9, \"Leases.\"\nRevenue Proration Agreement\n. As of December 31, 2020, a portion of our contract carrier arrangement with SkyWest Airlines, Inc. was structured as a revenue proration agreement. This revenue proration agreement establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               105\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings related to employment practices, environmental issues, antitrust matters and other matters concerning our business. We record liabilities for losses from legal proceedings when we determine that it is probable that the outcome in a legal proceeding will be unfavorable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Although the outcome of the legal proceedings in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of current matters will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Card Processing Agreements\nOur VISA/MasterCard and American Express credit card processing agreements provide that no cash reserve (\"Reserve\") is required, and no withholding of payment related to receivables collected will occur, except in certain circumstances, including when we do not maintain a required level of liquidity as outlined in the merchant processing agreements. In circumstances in which the credit card processor can establish a Reserve or withhold payments, the amount of the Reserve or payments that may be withheld would be equal to the potential liability of the credit card processor for tickets purchased with VISA/MasterCard or American Express credit cards, as applicable, that had not yet been used for travel. We did not have a Reserve or an amount withheld as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nOther Contingencies\nGeneral Indemnifications\nWe are the lessee under many commercial real estate leases. It is common in these transactions for us, as the lessee, to agree to indemnify the lessor and the lessor's related parties for tort, environmental and other liabilities that arise out of or relate to our use or occupancy of the leased premises. This type of indemnity would typically make us responsible to indemnified parties for liabilities arising out of the conduct of, among others, contractors, licensees and invitees at, or in connection with, the use or occupancy of the leased premises. This indemnity often extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but usually excludes any liabilities caused by either their sole or gross negligence or their willful misconduct.\nOur aircraft and other equipment lease and financing agreements typically contain provisions requiring us, as the lessee or obligor, to indemnify the other parties to those agreements, including certain of those parties' related persons, against virtually any liabilities that might arise from the use or operation of the aircraft or other equipment.\nWe believe that our insurance would cover most of our exposure to liabilities and related indemnities associated with the commercial real estate leases and aircraft and other equipment lease and financing agreements described above. While our insurance does not typically cover environmental liabilities, we have insurance policies in place as required by applicable environmental laws.\nSome of our aircraft and other financing transactions include provisions that require us to make payments to preserve an expected economic return to the lenders if that economic return is diminished due to specified changes in law or regulations. In some of these financing transactions, we also bear the risk of changes in tax laws that would subject payments to non-U.S. lenders to withholding taxes.\nWe cannot reasonably estimate our potential future payments under the indemnities and related provisions described above because we cannot predict (1) when and under what circumstances these provisions may be triggered and (2) the amount that would be payable if the provisions were triggered because the amounts would be based on facts and circumstances existing at such time.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               106\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nEmployees Under Collective Bargaining Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately\n74,000\nfull-time equivalent employees,\n23\n% of whom were represented by unions.\nThe following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions.\nWe are in mediated discussions with the representative of the Delta pilots regarding terms of their amendable collective bargaining agreement under the auspices of the National Mediation Board (\"NMB\").\nIn addition to the domestic airline employee groups discussed above, approximately\n190\nrefinery employees of Monroe are represented by the United Steel Workers under an agreement that expires on February 28, 2022. This agreement is governed by the National Labor Relations Act, which generally allows either party to engage in self-help upon the expiration of the agreement. Certain of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by unions, work councils or other local representative groups.\nOther\nWe have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty, acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract-specific equipment, as defined by each respective contract, if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date. Because these obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date, no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs.\nNOTE 13.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome Tax Provision\nOur income tax provision consisted of the following:\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               107\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table presents the principal reasons for the difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate:\nDeferred Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes.\nThe following table shows significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities:\n(1)\nAt December 31, 2020, the net deferred tax assets\nof $\n2.0\nbillion are recorded in deferred income taxes, net within noncurrent assets. At December 31, 2019, the net deferred tax liabilities of $\n1.3\nbillion included $\n120\nmillion of net state deferred tax assets, which are recorded in deferred income taxes, net within noncurrent assets, and $\n1.5\nbillion of net federal deferred tax liabilities, which are recorded in deferred income taxes, net within noncurrent liabilities.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020, w\ne had $\n5.7\nbillion of federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards, which will not begin to expire until 2027.\nValuation Allowance\nWe periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets. We establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results and tax planning strategies.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               108\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nAt December 31, 2020 our net deferred tax asset balance was $\n2.0\nbillion, including a $\n460\nmillion valuation allowance primarily related to capital loss carryforwards and state net operating losses. Although we are in a three year cumulative loss position as of December 31, 2020, we have a recent history of significant earnings prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to return to profitability as the effects of the pandemic subside and to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards before any expire. Our federal net operating loss carryforwards generated before 2018 do not begin to expire until 2027. Under current tax law, federal net operating losses generated in 2020 do not expire. Therefore, we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets other than the capital loss carryforwards and state net operating losses that have short expiration periods.\nIncome Tax Allocation\nWe consider all income sources, including other comprehensive income, in determining the amount of tax benefit allocated to continuing operations (\"Income Tax Allocation\"). The 2017 tax reform reduced the statutory tax rate in the U.S. from 35% to 21%. GAAP requires that the tax expense related to tax law changes be recognized in current earnings, even when a portion of the related deferred tax asset originated through amounts recognized in AOCI. As a result, approximately $\n750\nmillion of income tax expense remains in AOCI, primarily related to pension obligations, and will not be recognized in net income until the pension obligations are fully extinguished.\nOther\nThe amount of, and changes to, our uncertain tax positions were not material in any of the years presented. We are currently under audit by the IRS for the 2020 and 2019 tax years.\nNOTE 14.\nEQUITY AND EQUITY COMPENSATION\nEquity\nWe are authorized to issue\n2.0\nbillion shares of capital stock, of which up to\n1.5\nbillion may be shares of common stock, par value $\n0.0001\nper share, and up to\n500\nmillion may be shares of preferred stock.\nPreferred Stock.\nWe may issue preferred stock in one or more series. The Board of Directors is authorized (1) to fix the descriptions, powers (including voting powers), preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions with respect to any series of preferred stock and (2) to specify the number of shares of any series of preferred stock. We have not issued any preferred stock.\nTreasury Stock.\nWe generally withhold shares of Delta common stock to cover employees' portion of required tax withholdings when employee equity awards are issued or vest. These shares are valued at cost, which equals the market price of the common stock on the date of issuance or vesting. The weighted average cost per share held in treasury was $\n28.23\nand $\n26.37\nas of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWarrants.\nSee Note 2, \"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,\" for further discussion of the warrants issued during 2020 in connection with the payroll support program of the CARES Act to acquire more than\n6.7\nmillion of Delta common stock.\nEquity Compensation\nOur broad-based equity and cash compensation plan provides for grants of restricted stock, stock options, performance awards, including cash incentive awards and other equity-based awards (the \"Plan\"). Shares of common stock issued under the Plan may be made available from authorized, but unissued, common stock or common stock we acquire. If any shares of our common stock are covered by an award that expires, is canceled, forfeited or otherwise terminates without delivery of shares (including shares surrendered or withheld for payment of taxes related to an award), such shares will again be available for issuance under the Plan except for (1) any shares tendered in payment of an option, (2) shares withheld to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to the exercise of an option or stock appreciation right (\"SAR\") or (3) shares covered by a stock-settled SAR or other awards that were not issued upon the settlement of the award. The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to\n163\nmillion shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, there were\n21\nmillion shares available for future grants.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               109\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe make long-term incentive awards annually to eligible employees under the Plan. Generally, awards vest over time, subject to the employee's continued employment. Equity compensation expense, including awards payable in common stock or cash, is recognized in salaries and related costs over the employee's requisite service period (generally, the vesting period of the award) and totaled $\n119\nmillion, $\n161\nmillion and $\n159\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We record expense on a straight-line basis for awards with installment vesting. As of December 31, 2020, unrecognized costs related to unvested shares and stock options totaled $\n80\nmillion. We expect substantially all unvested awards to vest and recognize forfeitures as they occur.\nRestricted Stock\n. Restricted stock is common stock that may not be sold or otherwise transferred for a period of time and is subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances. The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of the common stock on the grant date. As of December 31, 2020, there were\n2.2\nmillion unvested restricted stock awards.\nStock Options.\nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of Delta common stock on the grant date and generally have a\n10\n-year term. We determine the fair value of stock options at the grant date using an option pricing model. As of December 31, 2020, there were\n5.4\nmillion outstanding stock option awards with a weighted average exercise price of $\n52.37\nof which\n2.4\nmillion were exercisable.\nPerformance Awards.\nPerformance awards are long-term incentive opportunities, which are payable in common stock or cash, and are generally contingent upon our achieving certain financial goals.\nOther.\nDuring each of 2020 and 2019, we recognized an immaterial amount of excess tax benefits in our income tax provision.\nNOTE 15.\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nThe following table shows the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss:\n(1)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI for pension and other benefits liabilities are recorded in miscellaneous, net in non-operating expense in the income statement.\n(2)\nIncludes approximately $\n750\nmillion of deferred income tax expense primarily related to pension and other benefit obligations that will not be recognized in net income until these obligations are fully extinguished. We consider all income sources, including other comprehensive income, in determining the amount of tax benefit allocated to results from operations.\n(3)\nIn the June 2020 quarter, all remaining foreign currency hedges expired, and we recognized an $\n83\nmillion tax benefit which was released from AOCI.\n(4)\nThe 2018 reclassification into retained earnings related to our investments in GOL, China Eastern and other previously designated available-for-sale investments, and the related conversion to accounting for changes in fair value of these investments from AOCI to the income statement.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               110\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 16.\nSEGMENTS\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker and is used in resource allocation and performance assessments. Our chief operating decision maker is considered to be our executive leadership team. Our executive leadership team regularly reviews discrete information for our\ntwo\noperating segments, which are determined by the products and services provided: our airline segment and our refinery segment.\nAirline Segment\nOur airline segment is managed as a single business unit that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the U.S. and around the world and includes our loyalty program, as well as other ancillary airline services. This allows us to benefit from an integrated revenue pricing and route network. Our flight equipment forms one fleet, which is deployed through a single route scheduling system. When making resource allocation decisions, our chief operating decision maker evaluates flight profitability data, which considers fleet type and route economics, but gives no weight to the financial impact of the resource allocation decision on a geographic region or mainline/regional carrier basis. Our objective in making resource allocation decisions is to optimize our consolidated financial results.\nRefinery Segment\nOur wholly owned subsidiaries, Monroe Energy, LLC, and MIPC, LLC (collectively, \"Monroe\"), operate the Trainer oil refinery and related assets located near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel. Monroe's operations include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the Northeastern U.S., including our New York hubs at LaGuardia and JFK.\nOur refinery segment operates for the benefit of the airline segment by providing jet fuel to the airline segment from its own production and through jet fuel obtained through agreements with third parties. The refinery's production consists of jet fuel, as well as non-jet fuel products. We use several counterparties to exchange the non-jet fuel products produced by the refinery for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations. The gross fair value of the products exchanged under these agreements during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n1.5\nbillion,\n$\n4.0\nbillion and $\n3.6\nbillion, respectively. The decline in exchange transactions was primarily driven by the decrease in demand for jet fuel from our airline operations as a result of the economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               111\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSegment Reporting\nSegment results are prepared based on our internal accounting methods described below, with reconciliations to consolidated amounts in accordance with GAAP. Our segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products and services included in each segment on a stand-alone basis.\n(1)\nRepresents transfers, valued on a market price basis, from the refinery to the airline segment for use in airline operations. We determine market price by reference to the market index for the primary delivery location, which is New York Harbor, for jet fuel from the refinery.\n(2)\nRepresents value of products delivered under our exchange agreements, as discussed above, determined on a market price basis.\n(3)\nThese sales were at or near cost; accordingly, the margin on these sales is de minimis.\n(4)\nRefinery segment operating results, including depreciation and amortization, are included within aircraft fuel and related taxes in our income statement.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               112\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 17.\n(LOSS)/EARNINGS PER SHARE\nWe calculate basic (loss)/earnings per share and diluted (loss) per share by dividing net (loss)/income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, excluding restricted shares. We calculate diluted earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock awards. Antidilutive common stock equivalents excluded from the diluted (loss)/earnings per share calculation are not material.\nThe following table shows our computation of basic and diluted (loss)/earnings per share:\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               113"

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Co-Chief Financial Officers, concluded that the controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020 to ensure that material information was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Co-Chief Financial Officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2020, we did not make any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 using the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation, management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which also audited our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. Ernst & Young LLP's report on our internal control over financial reporting is set forth below.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               114\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nDelta Air Lines, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Delta Air Lines, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on\nthe COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nand the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss)/income, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated February 12, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K                                               115"
