    "text": "The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., founded in 1946 by Estée and Joseph Lauder, is one of the world’s leading manufacturers, marketers and sellers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. Our products are sold in approximately 150 countries and territories under a number of well-known brand names including: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins, M·A·C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone London, Too Faced, Dr. Jart+, and The Ordinary. We are also the global licensee for fragrances, cosmetics and/or related products sold under various designer brand names. Each brand is distinctly positioned within the market for cosmetics and other beauty products.\nWe believe we are a leader in the beauty industry due to the global recognition of our brand names, our excellence in product innovation, our strong position in key geographic markets and the consistently high quality of our products and “High-Touch” services. We sell our prestige products through distribution channels that complement the luxury image and prestige status of our brands, and we provide “High-Touch” consumer experiences across our distribution channels. Our products are sold on our own and authorized retailer websites, on third-party online malls, in stores in airports, in duty-free locations and in our own and authorized freestanding stores. In addition, our products are sold in brick-and-mortar retail stores, including department stores, specialty-multi retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas. We believe that our strategy of pursuing selective distribution heightens the aspirational quality of our brands.\nFor a discussion of recent developments, including the impacts to consumer preferences and market trends due to the COVID-19 pandemic, see\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Overview\n.\nThe discussion of our net sales and operating results is based on specific markets in commercially concentrated locations, which may include separate discussions on territories within a country. For segment and geographical area financial information, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 – Segment Data and Related Information\n.\nWe have been controlled by the Lauder family since the founding of our Company. Members of the Lauder family, some of whom are directors, executive officers and/or employees, beneficially own, directly or indirectly, as of August 20, 2021, shares of our Company's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock having approximately 85% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock.\n2\nProducts\nSkin Care\n- Our broad range of skin care products addresses various skin care needs. These products include moisturizers, serums, cleansers, toners, body care, exfoliators, acne care and oil correctors, facial masks, and sun care products.\nMakeup\n- Our full array of makeup products includes lipsticks, lip glosses, mascaras, foundations, eyeshadows, nail polishes and powders. Many of the products are offered in an extensive palette of shades and colors. We also sell related items such as compacts, brushes and other makeup tools.\nFragrance\n- We offer a variety of fragrance products. The fragrances are sold in various forms, including eau de parfum sprays and colognes, as well as lotions, powders, creams, candles and soaps that are based on a particular fragrance.\nHair Care\n- Our hair care products include shampoos, conditioners, styling products, treatment, finishing sprays and hair color products.\nOther\n- We also sell ancillary products and services.\n3\nOur Brands\nGiven the personal nature of our products and the wide array of consumer preferences and tastes, as well as competition for the attention of consumers, our strategy has been to market and promote our products through distinctive brands seeking to address broad preferences and tastes. Each brand has a single global image that is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands in the market. Beauty brands are differentiated by numerous factors, including quality, performance, a particular lifestyle, where they are distributed (e.g., prestige or mass) and price point. Below is a chart showing most of the brands that we sell and how we view them based on lifestyle and price point:\n4\n5\n6\n7\nIn addition to the brands described above, we manufacture and sell products under the Do The Right Thing brand. In fiscal 2021, we made the decision to exit the global distribution of BECCA products, a makeup brand we acquired in 2016. We expect to substantially complete this exit during fiscal 2022.\nDuring fiscal 2021, we ceased global distribution of Prescriptives and Rodin olio lusso products and did not renew the license with Kiton.\nFrom time to time, we also make strategic minority investments in other companies, mainly in the beauty industry. In some cases, we have acquired the remaining interest or a majority interest (e.g., Have & Be Co. Ltd. (i.e. Dr. Jart+) and Deciem Beauty Group Inc., respectively). Our current minority investments include a company based in India that manufactures, markets and sells Ayurvedic skin care and other products under the Forest Essentials brand name, primarily in India.\nOur “heritage brands” are Estée Lauder, Clinique and Origins. Our “makeup artist brands” are M·A·C and Bobbi Brown. Our “luxury brands” are La Mer, Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, AERIN, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle and Kilian Paris. Our “designer fragrances” are sold under the Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, and Ermenegildo Zegna brand names, which we license from their respective owners.\nSocial Impact and Sustainability\nIn fiscal 2021, we continued to further integrate social impact and sustainability into our strategy and business operations. Our social impact and sustainability initiatives help drive innovation, growth and efficiency across the business and within our brand portfolio. Areas of focus include climate and energy; packaging; responsible sourcing; ingredient transparency; inclusion, diversity and equity; employee health and safety; and social investments. We have set goals or made commitments for these focus areas. For example, our goals related to climate and energy support efficiency and conservation within our facilities and internal supply chain, and some of these goals are also intended to help us reduce cost and waste.\nOur Nominating and ESG Committee, one of our Board committees, has oversight responsibility for our Company’s environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) activities and practices, including citizenship and sustainability matters. Our social impact and sustainability efforts are led by our Executive Chairman and our President and Chief Executive Officer. Other members of senior management, along with employees across the organization, help to drive our strategic initiatives concerning social impact and sustainability.\nAdditional information related to our social impact and sustainability matters can be found at\nwww.elcompanies.com\n.\n8\nDistribution\nWe sell our prestige products through distribution channels that complement the luxury image and prestige status of our brands, and we provide “High-Touch” consumer experiences across our distribution channels. Our products are sold on our own and authorized retailer websites, on third-party online malls, in stores in airports, in duty-free locations and in our own and authorized freestanding stores. In addition, our products are sold in brick-and-mortar retail stores, including department stores, specialty-multi retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas. Our general practice is to accept returns of our products from customers if properly requested and approved.\nIn fiscal 2021, we were impacted by the dramatic shifts in our distribution landscape and consumer behaviors attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we and certain retailers and distributors closed or decreased our presence in a number of existing points of distribution, we also continued to strategically open new points of distribution globally and saw an expansion of online sales globally.\nOnline, we sell products from most of our brands direct-to-consumer through our brand.com sites and third-party online malls. We also sell our products wholesale to authorized retailers that resell online through retailer.com and pure-play sites. Our sites are in approximately 50 countries. While today a majority of these online sales are generated in mainland China, the United States and the United Kingdom, we continue to expand rapidly in other markets globally.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we operated approximately 1,600 freestanding stores. The total reflects the net impact during fiscal 2021 of store closures related to the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program, the decision not to renew leases at certain locations, certain freestanding stores previously operated by authorized third parties that were transitioned to us and existing DECIEM stores due to the increase in our ownership in that company. Most freestanding stores are operated by us under a single brand name, such as M·A·C, Jo Malone London, Aveda, Origins, Le Labo or DECIEM. We also operate over 200 multi-branded company stores in outlet malls. There are also approximately 700 Company-branded freestanding stores around the world operated by authorized third parties, primarily in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific.\nWe maintain dedicated sales teams that manage our retail accounts. We have wholly owned operations in over 50 countries, and two controlling interests that operate in several countries, through which we market, sell and distribute our products. In certain countries, we sell our products through carefully selected distributors who we believe share our commitment to protecting the image and position of our brands. In addition, we sell certain products in select domestic and international U.S. military exchanges. For information regarding our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 – Segment Data and Related Information\n.\nCustomers\nOur strategy is to build strong relationships globally with select retailers, and our senior management works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis in support of these relationships. We believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers. In addition, we connect with our consumers directly through freestanding stores, e-commerce sites and social media to build a robust omnichannel experience that allows a consumer to shop in these and other channels.\nOur largest customer in fiscal 2021 sells products primarily in China travel retail and accounted for 14% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2021, 7% for fiscal 2020 and 5% for fiscal 2019, and 10%, and 24%, of our accounts receivable at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n9\nMarketing\nOur strategy to market and promote our products begins with our well-diversified portfolio of more than 25 distinctive brands across four product categories. Our portfolio can be deployed in multiple distribution channels, key travel corridors and geographies where our global reputation and awareness of our brands benefit us. Our geographic and distribution channel diversity allows us to engage local consumers across an array of developed and emerging markets by emphasizing products and services with the greatest local relevance, inclusiveness and appeal. This strategy is built around “Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.” Our founder, Mrs. Estée Lauder, formulated this unique marketing philosophy to provide “High-Touch” service and high-quality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base. Our “High-Touch” approach is demonstrated through our integrated consumer engagement models that leverage our product specialists and technology to provide the consumer with a distinct and truly personalized experience that can include personal consultations with beauty advisors, in person or online, who demonstrate and educate the consumer on product usage and application. As our business has grown and channel mix has evolved, we have further expanded our marketing philosophy and “High-Touch” execution to build both online and offline personalized consumer experiences through digital and physical demonstration, targeted digital media and tailored trial-to-loyalty pathways. We plan to continue to leverage our core strengths, including the quality of our products, our “High-Touch” consumer engagement and a diversified portfolio of brands, channels and geographies.\nOur marketing strategies vary by brand, local market and distribution channel. We have a diverse portfolio of brands, and we employ different engagement models suited to each brand’s equity, distribution, product focus, understanding of the core consumer and local relevance. This enables us to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new consumers, create trial, build loyalty, drive consumer advocacy and address the transformation of consumer shopping behaviors. Hero products are at the core of our brand marketing strategies. They are the pillars of our brands and historically have provided strong results through high repeat sales and consumer loyalty. In addition to continuing to attract existing consumers, our hero products provide an opportunity for new consumers to be introduced to our desirable products, creating consumer traffic across all channels of distribution. We aim to further strengthen our hero products through continuous review of our product portfolio and strategic innovation. Our marketing planning approach leverages local insights to optimize allocation of resources across different media outlets and retail touch points to resonate with our most discerning consumers most effectively. This includes strategically deploying our brands and tailoring product assortments and communications to fit local tastes and preferences in cities and neighborhoods. Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house teams, in collaboration with external resources, that design and produce the sales materials, social media strategies, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand. For a number of products, we create and deploy 360° integrated consumer engagement programs. We build brand equity and drive traffic to retail locations and to our own and authorized retailers’ websites through digital and social media, magazines and newspapers, television, billboards in cities and airports, and direct mail and email. In addition, we seek editorial coverage for our brands and products in digital and social media and print, to drive influencer amplification.\nWe are increasing our brand awareness and sales through our strategic emphasis on technology, by continuing to elevate our digital presence encompassing e-commerce and m-commerce, as well as digital, social media and influencer marketing. We are investing in new analytical capabilities to promote a more personalized experience across our distribution channels. We continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), support e-commerce and m-commerce businesses via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and “High-Touch” consumer engagement, in order to continue to offer better experiences and services and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online. We also support our authorized retailers to strengthen their e-commerce businesses and drive sales of our brands on their websites. We have opportunities to expand our brand portfolio online around the world, and we continue to invest in new omnichannel concepts in the United States, China and other markets to increase brand loyalty by better serving consumers as they shop across channels and travel corridors. We have dedicated resources to implement creative, coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities to increase our direct access to consumers.\nPromotional activities, in-store displays, and online navigation are designed to attract new consumers, build demand and loyalty and introduce existing consumers to other product offerings from the respective brands. Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with some retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as sampling programs, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase. Sampling is a key promotional activity as the quality and perceived benefits of sample products are very effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers. Such activities attract consumers and keep existing consumers engaged. Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers, retailers, beauty advisors and makeup artists at the points of sale to enable us to offer a seamless experience across channels of distribution.\n10\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on consumer behaviors and has accelerated the trend for a digital-first consumer journey and e-commerce. This provided a catalyst for redesigning each brand's “High-Touch” experience and accelerated changes to our direct-to-consumer business models and consumer engagement programs, such as selling through social media and web conferencing platforms (“Virtual Selling”). These models and programs continue to provide distinct one-to-one and one-to-many “High-Touch” omnichannel services and personalized experiences by leveraging technology and our talented beauty advisors, consultants, and makeup artists.\nInformation Technology\nInformation technology supports all aspects of our business, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and finance. We continue to maintain and enhance our information technology systems in alignment with our long-term strategy. An increasing portion of our global information technology infrastructure is cloud-based. This allows for a more scalable platform to support current and future requirements and improves our agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies.\nWe recognize that technology presents opportunities for competitive advantage, and we continue to invest in new capabilities and the use of emerging technologies across various aspects of our business. During fiscal 2021, we responded to shifting consumer and employee behaviors driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. We invested in new marketing and consumer engagement capabilities globally with a focus on innovative digital experiences across our omnichannel landscape, as well as enabling productivity of an increasingly remote workforce through new solutions. Our strategy over the next few years includes continuing to build a strong and secure technology infrastructure to adapt to evolving business dynamics, which includes the expansion of our seamless omnichannel capabilities and our Virtual Selling, the creation of more modernized manufacturing and distribution facilities (including upgrades to existing facilities) powered by technology and the utilization of predictive analytics to optimize our supply and demand planning.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products. Our research and development group, which includes scientists, engineers, analysts, and other employees involved in product and packaging innovation, works closely with our marketing and product development teams and third-party suppliers to generate ideas, develop new products and product-line extensions, create new packaging concepts, and improve, redesign or reformulate existing products. In addition, these research and development personnel provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how to quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver environmentally responsible products that meet or exceed consumer expectations. The research and development group has both long-standing and continually growing research-based working relationships with several U.S. and international dermatology and medical institutions, research universities and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities. Members of the research and development group are also responsible for product safety, registration and regulatory compliance matters. As our business continues to grow globally, and to satisfy the demand for locally relevant consumer products, we have increased our focus on innovation in Asia/Pacific, especially in China, as well as in Japan and Korea. In fiscal 2021, we began construction at a newly leased site that will become our innovation center in Shanghai, as we aim to better meet the needs of consumers through local relevancy with superior capabilities in product and package design and consumer and clinical testing. Construction is in progress and the facility is expected to be operational in late fiscal 2022.\nOur research and development costs totaled $243 million, $228 million and $202 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are expensed as incurred. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,000 employees engaged in research and development activities. We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, see\nItem 2. Properties.\n11\nManufacturing, Warehousing and Raw Materials\nWe manufacture our products primarily in our own facilities in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada and also leverage global third-party manufacturing networks. We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies, minimize our impact on the environment, ensure supply sufficiency and reduce costs. Our plants are modern, and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated. In fiscal 2021, we began construction of a new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is expected to enable us to better meet demand and increase speed to market in the Asia/Pacific region. Construction is in progress and the facility is expected to be operational in early fiscal 2023. While we believe that our manufacturing network of internal and external sites is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated increased requirements, we continue to implement improvements in capacity, technology, and productivity and align our manufacturing with regional sales demand to be more agile. From time-to-time, demand changes may challenge our capacity for certain subcategories on a short-term basis, but we believe, this will not impact our ability to meet our annual or long-term strategic objectives.\nWe have established a flexible global distribution network of logistic providers that are managed by us or third parties. The network is designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels. We are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network, particularly as we work to anticipate and respond to channel shifts. We have established regional and local distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers and consumers.\nAs discussed above, we continue to focus on social impact and sustainability across our operations. Focus areas include employee health and safety and minimizing our impact on the environment. This is achieved, in part, through investment in equipment while enhancing the work environment through safe practices and capabilities. We also engage in initiatives to improve our equipment and buildings to support and deliver our sustainability goals and reduce our impact on the environment. Environmental efforts include waste reduction, zero industrial waste to landfill and investment in renewable energy sources.\nThe principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals. We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications. Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations function. We review our supplier base periodically with the specific objectives of improving quality, increasing innovation and speed-to-market, ensuring supply sufficiency and reducing costs. In addition, we focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies, lead-time reduction and reduced carbon footprint.\nSome of our products rely on single-source or a limited number of suppliers; however, we believe we have a robust business continuity strategy, sophisticated capacity planning tools and strategic inventory buffer and multi-sourcing solutions. In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and packaging components for virtually all materials used in the production of our products. We currently believe we have adequate resources of supply and that our portfolio of suppliers has the resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.\nWe are continually benchmarking the performance of our supply chain, and we augment our supply base and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing plants and networks based upon the changing needs of the business. As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.\nAs a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have leveraged our network of global supply, manufacturing and distribution, to help mitigate disruption to our supply chain and help enable our return to normal operations. By the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and throughout fiscal 2021, all of our manufacturing and distribution facilities were operating at sufficient levels.\n12\nCompetition\nThere is significant competition within each market where our skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products are sold. Brand recognition, product quality and effectiveness, distribution channels, accessibility, and price point are some of the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products and brands. Marketing, merchandising, in-store and online experiences and demonstrations, and new product innovations also have an impact on consumers’ purchasing decisions. There continues to be increased interest and awareness from our customers and consumers in environmentally sustainable products, and we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the resulting change in consumer preferences due to our social impact and sustainability efforts. With our portfolio of diverse brands sold in a variety of channels, we are one of the world’s leading manufacturers, marketers and sellers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.\nWe compete against a number of global and local companies. Some of our competitors are large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names. Our competitors include L’Oreal S.A.; Unilever; Procter & Gamble; Shiseido Company, Ltd.; L Brands; Natura & Co.; Beiersdorf; LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton; Chanel S.A.; Kao Corp; and LG Household & Health Care. We also face competition from a number of independent brands, some of which are backed by private-equity investors, as well as some retailers that have their own beauty brands. Certain of our competitors also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours.\nTrademarks, Patents and Copyrights\nWe own the trademark rights used in connection with the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of our products both in the United States and in the other principal countries where such products are sold, including Estée Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Lab Series, Origins, M·A·C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone London, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, Smashbox, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, GLAMGLOW, Kilian Paris, Too Faced, Dr. Jart+, DECIEM and The Ordinary and the names of many of the products sold under these brands. We are the exclusive worldwide licensee for fragrances, cosmetics and/or related products for Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, Dr. Andrew Weil, Ermenegildo Zegna and AERIN. For further discussion on license arrangements, including their duration, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – License Arrangements\n. We protect our trademarks in the United States and significant markets worldwide. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.\nA number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology. In addition, several products and packaging for such products are covered by design patents or copyrights. While we consider these patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is considered material to the conduct of our business.\nHuman Capital\nWe strive to operate responsibly and to build a sustainable business based on uncompromising ethics, integrity, fairness, diversity and trust, consistent with our Company values. We view human capital management and the strength of our employees as integral to the long-term success and resilience of our business. Our human capital management includes the following strategic areas, each of which is discussed further below:\n•\nInclusion, Diversity and Equity\n- Fostering an inclusive, diverse and equitable culture that provides our employees with personal and professional development opportunities, which helps to attract and retain the best talent and drive long-term growth.\n•\nTalent Recruitment, Retention, Learning and Development\n- Affording our employees learning opportunities to drive career development and enhance innovation, which helps to create strong and sustainable leadership across the organization and support ongoing development of new products and services.\n•\nHealth and Safety\n- Striving to provide a healthy and safe workplace for our employees, which we believe also enhances productivity.\n•\nEmployee Rewards\n- Offering competitive compensation and benefit packages to support our employees’ physical, mental and financial well-being, which helps us attract, incentivize and retain world-class talent.\n•\nVolunteerism and Community Engagement\n- Supporting volunteer efforts by our employees because our long-term success is closely tied to the vitality of the communities where we have a presence.\n13\nOur Board of Directors and its committees provide oversight to management on a wide range of human capital matters, including inclusion and diversity, health and safety, pay equity and compensation and benefits. We had approximately 62,000 and 75,000 employees worldwide, including demonstrators at points of sale who are employed by us, as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fiscal 2021 reduction in employees was driven primarily by fewer point of sale employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a combination of door closures and on-going in-store capacity restrictions, decisions to reduce the number of on-call and temporary employees, and voluntary resignations. At June 30, 2021, approximately 72% of our global employees were full-time, approximately 15% were temporary and approximately 13% were part-time employees, with approximately 30% of our global employees located in the United States and approximately 70% located outside of the United States. We recognize the importance of female representation, and, as of June 30, 2021, approximately 82% of our employees were female and approximately 55% of our employees at the level of Vice President and above were female. We have no employees in the United States that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. A limited number of employees outside of the United States are covered by works council agreements or other syndicate arrangements.\nInclusion, Diversity and Equity\nWe are committed to supporting an inclusive and diverse workplace that better enables us to create innovative products and services as we continually strive to meet the evolving needs of our diverse global consumers. Our objective in creating an environment of inclusion, diversity and equity is to enhance our ability to attract and retain the best talent globally and promote a sense of belonging. We continuously encourage a culture of fairness, equal access to opportunities, including positions of leadership, and transparency in employment matters. We have enhanced our strategy in many areas including hiring, employee engagement, development and talent management to further support inclusion, diversity and equity across the organization.\nWe are proud of our history of driving awareness and acceptance around the world and for standing up for the rights of individuals in the workplace and beyond. We have accelerated our efforts to make racial equity a priority by announcing a series of commitments across our business, focusing on U.S. operations. Areas where we have made commitments include programs related to listening and learning, talent and opportunity, representation, suppliers and investing in change.\nWe are also committed to gender equity and equitable pay practices. We have a number of programs to help accelerate the development and promotion of women, such as our Women's Leadership Network, and during fiscal 2021, we announced a plan to achieve gender pay equity across the organization.\nWe continue to prioritize cross-generational inclusion and diversity to help cultivate talent within our workforce. We are committed to various programs to continue our investment at all levels of seniority and tenure, including our Global Reverse Mentor Program that pairs seasoned leaders with more junior talent and was designed to give insights to the leadership team on current millennial and Gen Z habits, preferences and trends.\nTalent Recruitment, Retention, Learning and Development\nHiring, retaining and developing the best talent globally is key to our success in sustaining long-term growth. Our talent strategy is focused on employee engagement and investments in career development, as well as measuring, recognizing and rewarding performance. Our investments include providing programs to ensure our employees are equipped with the right skillsets and knowledge, as well as opportunities to transfer to other functions or regions through short-term and long-term assignments. We believe these programs and opportunities create a pipeline of talent and leadership, necessary to drive and deliver on our long-term strategy.\nTo enhance our culture and measure our human capital objectives, we regularly engage with our employees. We provide several mechanisms for our employees to provide their feedback, including direct discussions with managers, employee surveys and interactive townhall meetings. Key topics covered during employee engagement include inclusion, diversity and equity, learning and development, work-life structure, and employee benefits. Based on our review of employee survey results, action plans are implemented to enhance employee satisfaction and to ensure alignment with our overall human capital strategy.\nAn important element of our talent strategy is succession planning and building leadership at various levels across the organization. We regularly discuss potential successors to key roles, review relevant backgrounds and capabilities and develop succession plans accordingly.\nTo enhance innovation, productivity and our speed to market, we aim to foster an environment of curiosity and to create a workplace that encourages continuous learning and development. We offer training and development programs that are focused on strengthening leadership and professional skills at various stages of an employee’s career. Our programs are offered through in-person, online or virtual learning experiences.\n14\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adjusted and reprioritized our training and development programs and delivery methods to meet the needs of our employees who are working from home. These changes included delivering learning experiences around subject matters such as managing remotely, mental health awareness and building resilience during uncertain times, as well as pivoting traditional in-person sessions to virtual instructor-led learning. In addition, we continue to curate digital content to support “business as usual” focus areas, such as performance development, as well as socially relevant information around racial justice and inclusion and diversity.\nHealth and Safety\nWe are committed to providing a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. We establish and update safety policies and procedures, train employees on our safety guidelines and local requirements, and create a culture focused on safety through ongoing communication, awareness and engagement. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented new health and safety protocols and modified a number of our business practices to protect our employees, including allowing our office-based employees to work remotely, imposing restrictions for business travel, and implementing safety measures for on-site employees.\nEmployee Rewards\nWe offer compelling and competitive compensation packages with the objectives to attract, motivate and retain world-class talent, and we are committed to fair and equitable pay across the organization. Employee compensation is based on specific circumstances, including role and experience, geographic location and performance. In addition to base pay, we offer annual incentive awards and equity awards for employees at certain job grades.\nTo support the health and well-being of our employees, we offer competitive benefit packages that may include pension and post-retirement benefit plans, health and wellness benefits, flexible working arrangements, parental (maternal and paternal) leave, adoption assistance and education-related benefits, which may vary by country.\nIn response to the challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed several employee initiatives that were implemented at the global, regional and local levels with the objective to support the physical, mental and financial well-being of our employees.\nVolunteerism and Community Engagement\nWe are dedicated to being active and respectful citizens, and we engage in philanthropic and employee volunteering efforts to enhance the communities we touch. We are inspired by the generosity of our employees and encourage them to become involved in their communities by offering programs to support the causes that matter to them. To empower employees, ELC Good Works, our global charitable and volunteerism program, allows eligible employees to create and participate in volunteer activities, with their cash donations matched by the Company and volunteer hours rewarded through additional cash donations by the Company.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold. Such laws and regulations relate to a wide range of matters including ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, advertising, transport and the sale, disposal and safety of our products, as well as environmental matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, including capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, earnings or competitive position.\nSeasonality\nOur results of operations in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year. The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by consumers for special events and by retailers for holiday selling seasons. Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions or the particular retail calendars followed by our customers that are retailers, which may impact their order placement and receipt of goods. Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by key shopping events, as well as variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.\n15\nAvailability of Reports\nWe make available financial information, news releases and other information on our website:\nwww.elcompanies.com\n. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other reports, as well as any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available free of charge via the EDGAR database at\nwww.sec.gov\nor our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports and amendments with, or furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stockholders may also contact Investor Relations at 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153 to obtain a hard copy of these reports without charge.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Conduct\nThe Board of Directors has developed corporate governance practices to help it fulfill its responsibilities to stockholders in providing general direction and oversight of management. These practices are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. We also have a Code of Conduct (“Code”) applicable to all employees, officers and directors of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and other senior financial officers. These documents and any waiver of a provision of the Code granted to any senior officer or director or any material amendment to the Code may be found in the “Investors” section of our website\n:\nwww.elcompanies.com\nunder the heading “Corporate Governance.” The charters for the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and ESG Committee may be found in the same location on our website. Stockholders may also contact Investor Relations at 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153 to obtain a hard copy of these documents without charge.\nInformation about our Executive Officers*\n*as of August 20, 2021, except as otherwise noted below\n(1)\nMr. Canevari joined the Company in April 2021, and Mr. Polcer retired from the Company effective July 1, 2021.\n(2)\nMs. Webster joined the Company in May 2021, and Ms. Trower retired from the Company effective July 1, 2021.\n16\nAll of the executive officers named above have been employees of the Company for more than five years, with the exception of Roberto Canevari, Deirdre Stanley and Meridith Webster.

    "text": "There are risks associated with an investment in our securities. Please consider the following risks and all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur or other risks arise or develop, our business, which includes our prospects, financial condition and results of operations, the trading prices of our securities and our reputation, may be adversely affected.\nRisks related to our Business and our Industry\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nThe outbreak and global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to significantly disrupt our operating environment, including retail stores, travel retail, and the ability of some of our customers to operate. We have also seen shifts in consumer preferences and practices.\nConsiderable uncertainty remains regarding this pandemic, including responsive measures being taken by various authorities and others. As we continue to monitor COVID-19 developments, including the impacts on our consumers, customers and suppliers, we have taken and will continue to take further measures. Some of the actions we take could adversely impact our business, and there is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks and the impacts of COVID-19.\nThe degree to which COVID-19 continues to impact our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, many of which are outside our control, including the extent to which there are sustainable improvements in the retail environment and general economic conditions.\nThe beauty business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.\nWe face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies. Some competitors have greater resources than we do, others are newer companies (some backed by private-equity investors), and some are competing in distribution channels where we are less represented. In some cases, we may not be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions as quickly as our competitors. Competition in the beauty business is based on a variety of factors including pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and m-commerce initiatives and other activities. It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas.\nOur ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business. Our Company has a well-recognized and strong reputation that could be negatively impacted by social media and many other factors. If our reputation is adversely affected, our ability to attract and retain customers and consumers could be impacted. In addition, certain of our key retailers around the world market and sell competing brands or are owned or otherwise affiliated with companies that market and sell competing brands. Our inability to continue to compete effectively in key countries around the world could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n18\nOur inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer preferences for skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, attitudes toward our industry and brands, as well as to where and how consumers shop. We must continually work to develop, manufacture and market new products, maintain and adapt our “High-Touch” services to existing and emerging distribution channels, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, successfully manage our inventories, and modernize and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products. We recognize that consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly, driven by the use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to sudden challenges that we may face in the marketplace, trends in the market for our products and changing consumer demands and sentiment, our financial results will suffer. In addition, from time to time, sales growth or profitability may be concentrated in a relatively small number of our brands, channels or countries. If such a situation persists or a number of brands, channels or countries fail to perform as expected, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn key markets, such as the United States, we have seen a decline in retail traffic in our department store customers and in our freestanding stores. We continue to see the shift in consumer preference to the online channel, which accelerated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consolidation or liquidation in the retail trade, from these or other factors, may result in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers and could result in an increased risk related to the concentration of our customers. A severe, adverse impact on the business operations of our customers could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. If one or more of our largest customers change their strategies (including pricing or promotional activities), enter bankruptcy (or similar proceedings) or if our relationship with any large customer is changed or terminated for any reason, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to achieve our long-term strategy.\nAchieving our long-term strategy will require investment in new capabilities, brands, categories, distribution channels, supply chain facilities, technologies and emerging and more mature geographic markets. These investments may result in short-term costs without any current sales and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings. In addition, we may dispose of or discontinue select brands or streamline operations and incur costs or restructuring and other charges in doing so. Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in sales and profitability, we may not realize the anticipated benefits. The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the beauty industry and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAcquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional risks.\nWe continuously review acquisition and strategic investment opportunities that would expand our current product offerings, our distribution channels, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities. In addition, we periodically review our brand portfolio, and our strategy includes potential divestitures of certain brands as we rationalize product offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify these strategic actions and consummate such transactions on favorable terms.\nAcquisitions including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks, which may include: (i) difficulties in integrating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from, or customers, consumers or suppliers of, acquired businesses; (ii) diversion of management’s attention from our existing businesses; (iii) adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, customers and consumers of ours or the companies in which we invest; (iv) adverse impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business; (v) reputational risks associated with the activities of the businesses that we acquire or in which we invest; and (vi) risks of entering distribution channels, categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.\nIf required, the financing for these transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our stockholders or both. The purchase price for some acquisitions may include additional amounts to be paid in cash in the future, a portion of which may be contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results of the acquired business. If the performance of any such acquired business exceeds such operating results, then we may incur additional charges and be required to pay additional amounts.\n19\nCompleted acquisitions typically result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet. We are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to achieve the long-term plan for acquired businesses, as well as any other adverse consequences associated with our acquisition, divestiture and investment activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by social impact and sustainability matters.\nThere is an increased focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning social impact and sustainability matters. From time to time, we announce certain initiatives, including goals and commitments, regarding our focus areas, which include environmental matters, packaging, responsible sourcing, social investments and inclusion and diversity. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives, or in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives. Such failures could be due to changes in our business (e.g., shifts in business among distribution channels or acquisitions). Moreover, the standards by which citizenship and sustainability efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions that could change over time. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of our initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Any such matters, or related social impact and sustainability matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA general economic downturn, or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and/or the financial strength of our customers that are retailers, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control. Consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products. A decline in consumer purchases of discretionary items also tends to impact our customers that are retailers. We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. However, the financial difficulties of a retailer could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to the receivables from that retailer. In the event of a retailer liquidation, we may incur additional costs if we choose to purchase the retailer’s inventory of our products to protect brand equity. Our inability to collect receivables from our largest customers or from a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, sudden disruptions in local or global business conditions, for example, from events such as a pandemic or other health issues, geo-political or local conflicts, civil unrest, terrorist attacks, adverse weather conditions, climate changes or seismic events, can have a short-term and, sometimes, long-term impact on consumer spending.\nEvents that impact consumers’ willingness or ability to travel or purchase our products while traveling may impact our business, including travel retail, a significant contributor to our overall results, and our strategy to market and sell products to international travelers at their destinations.\nA downturn in the economies of, or continuing recessions in, the countries where we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those countries could adversely affect consumer confidence, the financial strength of our retailers and our sales and profitability. We are also cautious of foreign currency movements, including their impact on tourism. Additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of the global macroeconomic environment; social, political and human rights issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues.\n20\nVolatility in the financial markets and a related economic downturn in key markets or markets generally throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we typically generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, credit markets may experience significant disruptions. Deterioration in global financial markets or an adverse change in our credit ratings could make future financing difficult or more expensive. If any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements, such as foreign exchange or interest rate hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain foreign currency or interest rate exposures which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products. If our products are found to be defective or unsafe, our product claims are found to be deceptive, or our products otherwise fail to meet our consumers’ expectations, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of our brands could be diminished, and we could lose sales and become subject to liability or claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, counterfeit versions of some of our products may be sold by third parties, which may pose safety risks, may fail to meet consumers’ expectations, and may have a negative impact on our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel, including our executive officers and senior management team. The unexpected loss of, or misconduct by, one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business. Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain personnel across all levels of our business. Competition for employees can be intense. We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain necessary personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. This risk may be exacerbated by the stresses associated with the implementation of our strategic plan and other initiatives, as well as by market conditions.\nWe are subject to risks related to the global scope of our operations.\nWe operate on a global basis, with a majority of our fiscal 2021 net sales and operating income generated outside the United States. We maintain offices in over 50 countries and have key operational facilities located inside and outside the United States that manufacture, warehouse or distribute goods for sale throughout the world. Our global operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including: (i) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the relative costs of operating in different places, which can affect our results of operations, the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and competitors sell products in the same markets, the cost of certain inventory and non-inventory items required in our operations, and the relative prices at which we sell our products in different markets; (ii) foreign or U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including restrictions on trade, immigration and travel, operations, and investments; currency exchange controls; restrictions on imports and exports, including license requirements; tariffs; and taxes; (iii) lack of well-established or reliable legal and administrative systems in certain countries in which we operate; (iv) adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; and (v) social, economic and geopolitical conditions, such as a pandemic, terrorist attack, war or other military action. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA disruption in our operations or supply chain could adversely affect our business.\nAs a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, capacity constraints, disruptions in ingredient, material or packaging supply, as well as global shortages, disruptions in supply chain or information technology, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe use a wide variety of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services from around the world. Some of our products rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers. Changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers could subject us to losses or adversely affect our ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of our suppliers to deliver goods and services in sufficient quantities, in compliance with applicable standards, and in a timely manner could adversely affect our customer service levels and overall business. In addition, any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations.\n21\nAs we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions.\nAs part of our long-term strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner. In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers. These include certain information technology, supply chain, finance and human resource functions. The failure of one or more such providers to deliver the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, when we transition external service providers, we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nChanges in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies around the world. Changes in these laws, regulations and policies, including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results. These changes include accounting standards, laws and regulations relating to tax matters, trade, data privacy (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), anti-corruption, advertising, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, customs matters, product registration, ingredients, chemicals, packaging, selective distribution, environmental or climate change matters.\nDisputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, other disputes or regulatory proceedings across a wide range of matters, including ones relating to employment, real estate, environmental, regulatory, advertising, trade relations, tax, privacy and product liability matters (including asbestos-related claims). In general, claims made by us or against us in litigation, disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, disputes or proceedings to which we currently are or may in the future become party to, and the impact of certain of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business\n.\nGovernment reviews, inquiries, investigations and actions could harm our business.\nAs we operate in various locations around the world, our operations are subject to governmental scrutiny and may be adversely impacted by the results of such scrutiny. The regulatory environment with regard to our business is evolving, and officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations. From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations or standards. Any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards could negatively impact us in a number of ways, including the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, or similar results, all of which could potentially harm our business. Regardless of the outcomes, these reviews, inquiries, investigations and actions could create negative publicity which could harm our business.\nRisks related to Technology and Cybersecurity Matters\nOur information technology and websites may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches, outages and other risks.\nWe rely on information technology that supports our business processes, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, finance and intracompany communications throughout the world. We have e-commerce, m-commerce and other Internet websites in the United States and many other countries. These systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and other events. Our systems and data may be vulnerable to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats such as malware, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of these or other events could disrupt or damage our information technology, including operational technology, and adversely affect our business. Insurance policies that may provide coverage with regard to such events may not cover any or all of the resulting financial losses.\n22\nFailure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent upon automated information technology processes. As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain information that is confidential, proprietary or otherwise sensitive, including personal information with respect to customers, consumers and employees. We share some of this information with certain vendors who assist us with business matters. Moreover, the success of our e-commerce and m-commerce operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our confidential data and personal information, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees’, consumers’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a security or data privacy breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to enhance our information security systems and could result in a disruption to our operations. Furthermore, third parties, including our suppliers and customers, also rely on information technology and may be subject to cybersecurity breaches that could impact their businesses and could in turn disrupt our supply chain and/or our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our global information technology.\nOur implementation, maintenance and utilization of global information technology, including operational technology, supply chain and finance systems, human resource management systems, creative asset management and retail operating systems, as well as associated hardware and use of cloud-based models, involve risks and uncertainties. Failure to implement, maintain or utilize these and other systems as planned, in terms of timing, specifications, security policies, costs, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks related to our Securities and our Ownership Structure\nThe trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our financial performance.\nOur business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth and profitability, not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. At the same time, however, we recognize that it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our expectations regarding certain aspects of our business. This could include forecasts of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections. We assume no responsibility to provide or update guidance, and any longer-term guidance we may provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. We historically have paid dividends on our common stock and repurchased shares of our Class A Common Stock; however, at times we have suspended the declaration of dividends and/or the repurchase of our Class A Common Stock. Going forward, at any time, we could stop or suspend payment of dividends or stop or suspend our stock repurchase program, and any such action could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nIn all of our public statements when we make, or update, a forward-looking statement about our business, whether it be about net sales or earnings expectations or expectations regarding restructuring or other initiatives, or otherwise, we accompany such statements directly, or by reference to a public document, with a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we expect. Such a list is included, among other places, in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC (e.g., in our reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q). These and other factors may make it difficult for us and for outside observers, such as research analysts, to predict what our earnings or other financial metrics, or business outcomes, will be in any given fiscal quarter or year.\nOutside analysts and investors have the right to make their own predictions of our business for any future period. Outside analysts, however, have access to no more material information about our results or plans than any other public investor, and we do not endorse their predictions as to our future performance. Nor do we assume any responsibility to correct the predictions of outside analysts or others when they differ from our own internal expectations. If our actual results differ from those that outside analysts or others have been predicting, the market price of our securities could be affected. Investors who rely on the predictions of outside analysts or others when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.\n23\nWe are controlled by the Lauder family. As a result, the Lauder family has the ability to prevent or cause a change in control or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.\nAs of August 20, 2021, members of the Lauder family beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having approximately 85% of the outstanding voting power of the Common Stock. In addition, there are four members of the Lauder family who are Company employees and members of our Board of Directors.\nAs a result of their stock ownership and positions at the Company, as well as our dual-class structure, the Lauder family has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including all matters requiring stockholder approval (e.g., the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation, and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets) for the foreseeable future. In addition, if significant stock indices decide to prohibit the inclusion of companies with dual-class stock structures, the price of our Class A Common Stock could be negatively impacted and could become more volatile.\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not “controlled companies.”\nThe Lauder family and their related entities own more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, as a result, we are a “controlled company” under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, we are exempt under the New York Stock Exchange standards from the obligation to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that (1) a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors; (2) we have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and (3) we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities.\nWhile we have voluntarily caused our Board to have a majority of independent directors and the written charters of our Nominating and ESG Committee and the Compensation Committee to have the required provisions, we are not requiring our Nominating and ESG Committee and Compensation Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors. As a result of our use of the “controlled company” exemptions, investors will not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements."

    "text": "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories, which are distributed in approximately 150 countries and territories. The following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 and reflects the basis of presentation described in\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nand\nNote 22 – Segment Data\nand\nRelated Information\nfor all periods presented. Products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category.\n(1)\nThe net sales from our travel retail business are included in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa region, with the exception of the net sales of Dr. Jart+ in the travel retail channel that are reflected in Korea in the Asia/Pacific region. Operating income attributable to the travel retail sales included in Europe, the Middle East & Africa is included in that region and in The Americas.\n28\nDuring fiscal 2020, changes were made to reflect certain Leading Beauty Forward enhancements made to the capabilities and cost structure of our travel retail business, which are primarily centralized in The Americas region, and resulted in a change to the royalty structure of the travel retail business to reflect the value created in The Americas region. Accordingly, the fiscal 2019 operating income of The Americas was increased, with a corresponding decrease in Europe, the Middle East & Africa, by $866 million, to conform with the fiscal 2021 and 2020 methodology and presentation.\nThe following table presents certain consolidated earnings data as a percentage of net sales:\nWe continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives. The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period. The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods. While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. See\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n29\nWe operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations. Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We calculate constant currency information by translating current-period results using prior-year period weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates and adjusting for the period-over-period impact of foreign currency cash flow hedging activities.\nOverview\nCOVID-19 Business Update\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt our operating environment, including impacts on retail traffic and changes in certain consumer preferences. During fiscal 2021, the spread of COVID-19, as well as the resurgences in COVID-19 cases and the rapid spread of variants, including the Delta variant, particularly in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Latin America, and Asia outside of China, led to government restrictions to prevent further spread of the virus. Restrictions in many parts of the world at various times during fiscal 2021 have included temporary business closures, curtailment of travel, mask wearing, social distancing and quarantines.\nRetail Impact\nMost brick-and-mortar retail stores that sell our products, whether operated by us or our customers, were open during the fiscal 2021 second quarter in China and the United States. There were intermittent closures throughout the rest of the world, particularly in the second half of fiscal 2021. In most of the Asia/Pacific region (with the exception of China), the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Canada, and much of Latin America, many retail stores were temporarily closed for some period during the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases. In much of the United Kingdom and Continental Europe, retail locations gradually reopened during the fourth quarter but with capacity and other safety restrictions in place. Globally, in areas where stores were open, consumer traffic has not recovered to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. International travel has remained largely curtailed globally due to both government restrictions and consumer health concerns that continue to adversely impact consumer traffic in most travel retail locations. Conversely, domestic travel in China, especially in Hainan, and some other travel corridors in Asia/Pacific and The Americas were open.\nSomewhat offsetting the significant declines in brick-and-mortar channels, net sales growth of our products online (through our own websites, third-party platforms and websites of our retailers) remained strong in every region during fiscal 2021.\nDue in large part to the continued challenging retail environment and uncertainties stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognized Goodwill, other intangible asset and long-live asset impairments. See\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nand\nNote 7 – Leases\nfor further information.\nConsumer Preferences\nThe COVID-19 pandemic-related closures of offices, retail stores and other businesses and the significant decline in social gatherings have influenced consumer preferences and practices. Specifically, the demand for makeup continues to be weak given fewer makeup usage occasions and ongoing mask wearing, while other categories have been more resilient.\nCost Controls\nIn response to the ongoing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to implement cost control actions in certain areas of the business to effectively manage the changing business environment.\nGovernment Assistance\nBeginning in the second half of fiscal 2020, many governments in locations where we operate announced programs to assist employers whose businesses were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including programs that provide rebates to incentivize employers to maintain employees on payroll who were unable to work for their usual number of hours. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we qualified for and recorded $84 million and $99 million, respectively, in government assistance, which reduced Selling, general and administrative expenses by $78 million and $87 million, respectively, and Cost of sales by $6 million and $10 million, respectively. The remaining $2 million recorded in fiscal 2020 was deferred and recognized in fiscal 2021 as a reduction to Cost of sales. We are continuing to review applicable government assistance programs globally.\nWe will continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and adjust our action plans accordingly as the situation progresses.\n30\nBusiness Update\nWe are a leader in prestige beauty, which combines the repeat purchase and relative affordability of consumer goods with the high quality products and services of luxury goods. Within prestige beauty, we are well diversified by product category, geography, brand, product sub-category, channel, consumer segment and price point. This diversity allows us to leverage consumer analytics and insights with agility by deploying our brands to fast growing and profitable opportunities. These analytics and insights, combined with our creativity, inform our innovation to provide a broad, locally-relevant and inclusive range of prestige products allowing us to compete effectively for a greater share of a consumer's beauty routine.\n•\nIn fiscal 2021, global prestige skin care continued to lead product category growth. Our skin care net sales benefited from the enduring strength of hero product lines such as Advanced Night Repair from Estée Lauder, Crème de La Mer from La Mer, and the Dramatically Different products and Even Better Clinical Radical Dark Spot Corrector + Interrupter from Clinique, as well as recent product launches, the growth in Asia and targeted expanded consumer reach. The launches of Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex, Revitalizing Supreme+ Bright, and the relaunch of Perfectionist Pro from Estée Lauder, Genaissance de la Mer The Concentrated Night Balm from La Mer, and Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator from Clinique were particularly successful in Asia/Pacific. Net sales of skin care products in fiscal 2021 rose in every geographic region, led by Estée Lauder. La Mer and Dr. Jart+, which we acquired in December 2019.\n•\nGlobal prestige makeup sales declined as COVID-19 limited social and business activities and consumers overall wore less makeup. Some sub-categories in makeup performed better in the COVID-19 environment, including lip gloss and makeup with skin care benefits such as tinted moisturizers, while demand for lipstick and foundation remained weak. During fiscal 2021, our makeup net sales benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach and the continued success of existing products, such as the Futurist line of products from Estée Lauder, The Luminous Lifting Cushion Foundation from La Mer and the Lip Injection line from Too Faced.\n•\nOur fragrance net sales growth accelerated during fiscal 2021, driven by continued resilience in luxury fragrance. The growth was led by strength in colognes, bath, body and home subcategories at Jo Malone London, the successful launches of Bitter Peach and Rose Prick Private Blend fragrances from Tom Ford Beauty and targeted expanded consumer reach of Le Labo.\n•\nOur hair care net sales grew as salons and retail stores reopened throughout the year and strong online growth continued. Hero products led growth at Aveda, supported by the brand’s “100% vegan” campaign.\nOur global distribution capability and operations allow us to focus on targeted expanded consumer reach wherever consumer demographics and trends are the most attractive. Our regional organizations, and the expertise of our people there, enable our brands to be more locally and culturally relevant in both product assortment and communications. We are evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores, online and where they travel, including by expanding our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories. We tailor implementation of our strategy by market to drive consumer engagement and embrace cultural diversity. We continuously strengthen our presence in large, image-building core markets, while broadening our presence in emerging markets.\n•\nIn North America, we deployed a number of strategies to drive growth, which began to deliver improvements through the second half of fiscal 2021. Net sales in fiscal 2021 from our specialty-multi and online channels led growth. In Latin America, we continue to launch new brands, develop our online business, expand social media outreach and encourage consumers to trade up from mass beauty products.\n•\nIn Europe, the Middle East & Africa, we continue to expand the consumer reach of many of our brands and strengthen their digital and social media presences.\n•\nIn Asia/Pacific, particularly in China, we continue to leverage our diversified brand portfolio and expansion on third-party online malls to benefit from the strong consumer demand for prestige beauty. In mainland China, net sales grew strong double digits reflecting growth in virtually all product categories, as well as in nearly every brand and double-digit growth in every channel, led by online.\nWe approach distribution strategically by product category and location and seek to optimize distribution by matching our brands with appropriate opportunities while seeking to maintain high productivity per door. We are expanding our brands in online and travel retail, which we believe will be higher growth channels in the long term. We also focus on brand-building retail activities, technology-driven activations and omnichannel capabilities that enhance the shopping experience for consumers.\n31\n•\nAs part of this strategy, we have built a leadership position in the global travel retail channel, that historically allowed us to leverage the robust and growing international passenger traffic. While COVID-19 has significantly curtailed international travel in the near-term, we continue to believe that global travel retail is a growth opportunity for the long-term. Travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building due to the increase in traveling consumers, particularly those from emerging markets, who often experience our brands for the first time while traveling. We continue to expand our strategic presence in travel retail across duty-free locations primarily in airports and downtown stores and increasingly through online pretail. We engage consumers at the airport through compelling pop-up activations in non-traditional commercial areas, and we ensure we have appropriate communication and curated assortments for targeted consumer groups. At the same time, travel retail is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers’ willingness and ability to travel and spend.\n•\nOnline net sales have continued to grow strongly on a global basis, rising strong double digits for fiscal 2021. Nearly every brand grew as we continue to enhance and launch e- and m-commerce sites of our own in new and existing markets, collaborate with our retail customers on their e- and m-commerce sites, and sell through select third-party online malls. We believe our success in delivering particularly strong online growth is a result of adapting our strategy to meet local market and cultural needs. We also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts, virtual try-on tools and compelling content to deliver an integrated consumer experience and better serve consumers as they shop across channels.\nOur multiple engines of growth, which have historically enabled us to produce excellent net sales growth, are also helping to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also benefited from the transformation of certain operations that freed up resources to invest behind further growth opportunities. Our Leading Beauty Forward Program and Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program (described below) enabled us to reduce costs and invest in new capabilities such as digital marketing and data analytics as well as increased advertising.\nIn fiscal 2021, we continued to further integrate social impact and sustainability into our strategy and business operations. Areas of differentiation include climate & energy, green chemistry, social investments, employee engagement and safety and inclusion, diversity & equity. Other areas of focus include responsible sourcing, plastics & packaging, ingredient transparency, and animal welfare.\nOutlook\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt business for us, retailers and other companies with which we do business. There have been, and are likely to continue to be, intermittent store closures, as well as restructurings and bankruptcies in the retail industry, including among our customers, and shifts in preferences as to where and how consumers shop, as well as changes in their preferences for certain products. We are mindful that these trends, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases globally and the related government restrictions may continue to impact the pace of recovery. The continued curtailment in international travel is also affecting our travel retail business in most of the world, which had been historically one of our fastest growth areas. In addition to impacting net sales and profitability, these and other challenges may adversely impact the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our brands and the long-lived assets in certain of our freestanding stores (i.e. potentially resulting in impairments).\nWe believe that the best way to increase long-term stockholder value is to continue providing superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing shifts in consumers’ behaviors and shopping practices. Accordingly, our long-term strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable. We plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth.\nWe continue to monitor the effects of the global macroeconomic environment, including potential inflation; social and political issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues. For example, we continue to monitor the geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n32\nThe uncertainty around the timing, speed and duration of the recovery from the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our ability to grow sales profitably. We believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of more ordinary challenges by continually developing and pursuing a diversified strategy with multiple engines of growth and by accelerating initiatives focused on areas of strength, discipline and agility, and by executing upon our Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program. As the current situation progresses, if economic and social conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged, there could be a further negative effect on consumer confidence, demand, spending and willingness or ability to travel and, as a result, on our business. We are continuing to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.\nLeading Beauty Forward\nIn May 2016, we announced a multi-year initiative (“Leading Beauty Forward” or the “LBF Program”) to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum. Leading Beauty Forward was designed to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and our ability to continue creating sustainable value. As of June 30, 2019, we concluded the approvals of all major initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward related to the optimization of select corporate functions, supply chain activities, and corporate and regional market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming businesses, and have substantially completed those initiatives through fiscal 2021. For additional information about restructuring and other charges, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 8 – Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities\n.\nPost-COVID Business Acceleration Program\nOn August 20, 2020, we announced a two-year restructuring program, Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program (the “PCBA Program”), designed to realign our business to address the dramatic shifts to our distribution landscape and consumer behaviors in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The PCBA Program is designed to help improve efficiency and effectiveness by rebalancing resources to growth areas of prestige beauty. It is expected to further strengthen us by building upon the foundational capabilities in which we have invested.\nThe PCBA Program’s main areas of focus include accelerating the shift to online with the realignment of our distribution network reflecting freestanding store and certain department store closures, with a focus on North America and Europe, the Middle East & Africa; the reduction in brick-and-mortar point of sale employees and related support staff; and the redesign of our regional branded marketing organizations, plus select opportunities in global brands and functions. This program is expected to position us to better execute our long-term strategy while strengthening our financial flexibility.\nWe previously estimated a net reduction over the duration of the PCBA Program in the range of approximately 1,500 to 2,000 positions globally, including temporary and part-time employees. We have revised these estimates based on the review of the PCBA Program. At this time, we estimate a net reduction over the duration of the PCBA Program in the range of 2,000 to 2,500 positions globally, including temporary and part-time employees. This reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions, retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas. We also estimate the closure over the duration of the PCBA Program of approximately 10% to 15% of our freestanding stores globally, primarily in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and in North America.\nWe plan to approve specific initiatives under the PCBA Program through fiscal 2022 and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2023. We expect that the PCBA Program will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $400 million and $500 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, contract terminations, asset write-offs and other costs to implement these initiatives.\nOnce fully implemented, we expect the PCBA Program to yield annual benefits, primarily in Selling, general and administrative expenses, of between $300 million and $400 million, before taxes. We expect to reinvest a portion behind future growth initiatives. For additional information about restructuring and other charges, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 8 – Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities\n.\n33\nImpairment Testing\nWe assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.\nDuring November 2020, given the actual and the estimate of the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of COVID-19 impacting us and lower than expected results from geographic expansion, we made further revisions to the internal forecasts relating to our GLAMGLOW reporting unit. We concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of GLAMGLOW's long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment test for the trademark and a recoverability test for the long-lived assets as of November 30, 2020. We concluded that the carrying value of the trademark for GLAMGLOW exceeded its estimated fair value, which was determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows, and recorded an impairment charge of $21 million. In addition, we concluded that the carrying value of the GLAMGLOW customer lists intangible asset was fully impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $6 million. The fair value of all other long-lived assets of GLAMGLOW exceeded their carrying values and were not impaired as of November 30, 2020. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademark and customer lists intangible assets, we completed an interim quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $54 million, reducing the carrying value of goodwill for the GLAMGLOW reporting unit to zero. The fair value of the GLAMGLOW reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit.\nBased on our annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2021, we determined that the carrying value of the GLAMGLOW and Smashbox trademarks exceeded their fair values. This determination was made based on updated internal forecasts, finalized and approved in June 2021, that reflected lower net sales growth projections due to a softer than expected retail environment for these brands, as well as the continued impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes in circumstances were also indicators that the carrying amounts of their respective long-lived assets may not be recoverable. We concluded that the carrying values of the trademarks exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows, and recorded impairment charges. We concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were recoverable. The carrying values of the customer lists and goodwill relating to the GLAMGLOW and Smashbox reporting units were zero as of November 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively.\nA summary of the impairment charges for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and the remaining trademark, customer lists and goodwill carrying values as of June 30, 2021, for each reporting unit, are as follows:\nThe impairment charges for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2021 were reflected in the Americas region.\nThe fair values of all reporting units, which were determined based on qualitative or quantitative assessments, with material goodwill were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values, with the exception of the DECIEM reporting unit. The carrying values of the DECIEM reporting unit and other intangible assets as of June 30, 2021 approximated their fair values.\nThe fair values of the Smashbox and GLAMGLOW trademarks were equal to their carrying values subsequent to the impairment charges taken as of April 1, 2021. The key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units are primarily predicated on the estimated future impacts of COVID-19, the success of future new product launches, the achievement of distribution expansion plans, and the realization of cost reduction and other efficiency efforts. If such plans do not materialize, or if there are further challenges in the business environments in which these reporting units operate, resulting changes in the key assumptions could have negative impacts on the estimated fair values of the reporting units and it is possible we could recognize additional impairment charges in the future.\nFor additional information, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\n34\nFiscal 2020 as Compared with Fiscal 2019\nSee\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations\nof the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 for the fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2019 comparative discussion.\nFiscal 2021 as Compared with Fiscal 2020\nNET SALES\n(1)\nSee “\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nThe fiscal 2021 increase in reported net sales mainly reflected higher net sales in the second half of the fiscal year compared to the prior-year period. Fiscal 2020 reported net sales reflected the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that started in the second half of that fiscal year, including the temporary closing of businesses deemed “non-essential,” travel bans and restrictions, social distancing and quarantines. Reported net sales increased in fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher net sales in skin care, fragrance and hair care, as well as growth in our Asia/Pacific and Europe, the Middle East & Africa regions. Skin care net sales growth primarily reflected higher net sales from Estée Lauder, La Mer, Dr. Jart+ and Clinique, as well as incremental net sales attributable to the increase in our ownership of DECIEM in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter.  Fragrance net sales increased, primarily benefiting from higher net sales from Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty and Le Labo, and higher net sales from Aveda and Bumble and bumble drove the growth in hair care. The increase in net sales in mainland China, our travel retail business and Korea drove growth internationally. Our direct-to-consumer online net sales continued to have strong growth.\nThe fiscal 2021 reported net sales increase was impacted by approximately $357 million of favorable foreign currency translation.\nReturns associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a Company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures. Accordingly, the following discussions of Net sales by\nProduct Categories\nand\nGeographic Regions\nexclude the fiscal 2021 impact of returns associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately $14 million.\n35\nProduct Categories\nSkin Care\n(1)\nSee “\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nReported skin care net sales increased in fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting higher net sales from Estée Lauder, La Mer, Clinique and Dr. Jart+, combined, of approximately $1,896 million, as well as incremental net sales attributable to our acquisition of Dr. Jart+ at the end of the fiscal 2020 second quarter and the increase in our ownership of DECIEM in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, combined, of approximately $332 million. Net sales increased from Estée Lauder and La Mer, led by our travel retail business (primarily in Hainan) and mainland China, reflecting strong growth from direct-to-consumer online net sales of products from these brands primarily due to successful holiday and promotional events. The net sales increase from Estée Lauder reflected the continued success of hero product franchises, such as Advanced Night Repair, Nutritious, Micro Essence, Revitalizing Supreme+ and Re-Nutriv, as well as fiscal 2021 product launches, such as Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex and Revitalizing Supreme+ Bright. The increase in net sales from La Mer also benefited from the continued success of hero products, such as The Treatment Lotion, Crème de la Mer, The Moisturizing Soft Cream and The Concentrate, as well as the fiscal 2021 launch of the Genaissance de la Mer The Concentrated Night Balm and targeted expanded consumer reach. Net sales increased from Clinique, primarily due to higher net sales in our travel retail business (primarily in Hainan), and higher net sales in North America and mainland China, reflecting the continued success of existing products, such as Dramatically Different products and Even Better Clinical Radical Dark Spot Corrector + Interrupter, new product launches, such as Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator, and strong direct-to-consumer online net sales growth.\nThe skin care net sales increase was impacted by approximately $225 million of favorable foreign currency translation.\nMakeup\n(1)\nSee “\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nReported makeup net sales decreased in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower net sales from virtually all brands, led by M·A·C and Clinique, combined, of approximately $476 million. The makeup product category continues to be more negatively impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the challenging environment in brick-and-mortar retail locations and fewer makeup usage occasions. The continued decline in prestige makeup and ongoing competitive activity in North America also contributed to the decline in net sales from these brands.\nThe makeup net sales decrease was impacted by approximately $82 million of favorable foreign currency translation.\n36\nFragrance\n(1)\nSee “\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nReported fragrance net sales increased in fiscal 2021, reflecting a recovery compared to the prior-year challenges, including store closures, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. The fiscal 2021 increase in fragrance net sales was led by higher net sales from Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty and Le Labo, combined, of approximately $317 million. The increase in net sales from Jo Malone London, led by mainland China and North America, benefited from successful holiday and promotional events, the success of certain hero product franchises and the new Blossoms Collection. Net sales from Tom Ford Beauty increased, reflecting growth in all geographic regions where we continued to have success with hero products, such as Oud Wood and Black Orchid, and new product launches, such as Bitter Peach, Tubereuse Nue and Costa Azzurra. Net sales from Le Labo grew strong double digits, reflecting higher net sales in all geographic regions driven by hero fragrances, home products and targeted expanded consumer reach.\nThe fragrance net sales increase was impacted by approximately $41 million of favorable foreign currency translation.\nHair Care\n(1)\nSee “\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nReported hair care net sales increased in fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher net sales from Aveda and to a lesser extent Bumble and bumble, combined, of approximately $60 million, reflecting a recovery compared to the prior-year challenges, including salon and store closures, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in net sales from Aveda also benefited from the success of existing product franchises, such as Nutriplenish and Invati, and the new product launch of Botanical Repair, which led to growth in all geographic regions.\n37\nGeographic Regions\nWe strategically time our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.\nThe Americas\n(1)\nSee “\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nFiscal 2021 reported net sales in The Americas increased slightly as compared to the prior-year period. Reported net sales in The Americas reflected higher net sales in North America, offset by the net sales decline in Latin America due to lower net sales in Brazil. Net sales in North America increased, reflecting a recovery compared to the prior-year challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and incremental net sales from the increase in our ownership of DECIEM in the fourth quarter. Latin America net sales declined, due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Brazil that led to government restrictions. Net sales in virtually all other markets in Latin America increased, reflecting a recovery compared to the prior-year challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our direct-to-consumer online net sales in The Americas grew double digits in fiscal 2021.\nThe net sales increase in The Americas included approximately $39 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nEurope, the Middle East & Africa\n(1)\nSee “\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nReported net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased in fiscal 2021, reflecting higher net sales primarily in our travel retail business and Russia, combined, of approximately $633 million. The increase in net sales reflected a recovery compared to the prior-year challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the continued curtailment of international travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in net sales from our travel retail business was led by the continued success of hero product franchises from Estée Lauder, La Mer and Clinique, reflecting the increase in China travel retail (primarily Hainan) due, in part, to increased duty-free purchase limits and the acceleration of new digital selling models. Direct-to-consumer online net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa grew double digits in fiscal 2021.\nThe net sales increase in Europe, the Middle East & Africa included approximately $101 million of favorable foreign currency translation.\n38\nAsia/Pacific\n(1)\nSee “\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nReported net sales in Asia/Pacific increased in fiscal 2021, reflecting higher net sales primarily in mainland China, Korea and Australia, combined, of approximately $1,279 million, driven by our skin care products. Incremental net sales in Asia/Pacific attributable to our acquisition of Dr. Jart+ at the end of the fiscal 2020 second quarter and the increase in our ownership of DECIEM in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, combined, was approximately $325 million. The increase in net sales in mainland China reflected higher net sales primarily of our skin care products, led by Estée Lauder, La Mer and Dr. Jart+, and in our third-party platform and department store channels. Net sales increased in Korea, primarily benefiting from incremental net sales from our acquisition of Dr. Jart+ at the end of the fiscal 2020 second quarter and higher net sales from Jo Malone London. The increase in net sales in Australia reflected a recovery compared to the prior-year challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Direct-to-consumer online net sales in Asia/Pacific grew double digits in fiscal 2021.\nPartially offsetting these increases in fiscal 2021, were lower net sales in Japan and Hong Kong, of approximately $71 million, combined, primarily due to the ongoing challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced consumer traffic in brick-and-mortar retail locations and the continued curtailment of international travel.\nThe net sales increase in Asia/Pacific included approximately $295 million of favorable foreign currency translation.\nGROSS MARGIN\nGross margin in fiscal 2021 increased to 76.4% as compared with 75.2% in fiscal 2020.\nThe favorable impact from our mix of business for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the favorable change in strategic pricing, lower costs from product sets and lower costs of promotional items as a result of reduced consumer traffic in brick-and-mortar retail locations.\n39\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2021 decreased to 60.2% as compared with 70.9% in fiscal 2020.\nThe fiscal 2021 decrease in operating expense margin was driven by the favorable year-over-year comparison of goodwill, other intangible and long-lived asset impairments of $1,238 million and a decrease in selling expense, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on brick-and-mortar retail locations, including the decline in consumer traffic, store closures, and the continued shift in consumer preference to online. The advertising, merchandising, sampling and product development favorability was driven by the increase in net sales, partially offset by the increase in advertising and promotional expense, primarily due to continued strategic investments and a difficult comparison to the prior-year period that reflected cost saving actions implemented in response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPartially offsetting these favorable impacts were increases in general and administrative expenses, primarily due to an increase in employee incentive compensation as compared to the prior-year period, which reflected lower accrued employee incentive compensation attributable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on performance.\nOPERATING RESULTS\n(1)\nSee “\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n40\nThe reported operating margin for fiscal 2021 increased from the prior year driven primarily by the year-over-year comparison of goodwill, other intangible and long-lived asset impairments of $1,238 million, or 890 bps, the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales and the increase in gross margin, as previously noted.\nThe fiscal 2021 and 2020 goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairments and the changes in fair value of contingent consideration impacted the operating results of our product categories and geographic regions as follows:\nCharges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they are centrally directed and controlled, are not included in internal measures of product category or geographic region performance and result from activities that are deemed Company-wide initiatives to redesign, resize and reorganize select areas of the business. Accordingly, the following discussions of Operating income by\nProduct Categories\nand\nGeographic Regions\nexclude the fiscal 2021 and 2020 impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities of $228 million, or 1% of net sales and $83 million, or 1% of net sales, respectively.\nProduct Categories\nSkin Care\n(1)\nSee\n“Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n41\nReported skin care operating income increased in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by higher results from Estée Lauder, La Mer and Clinique, combined, of approximately $1,183 million. The increases in operating income from these brands primarily reflected higher net sales, as well as lower selling expenses due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on brick-and-mortar retail locations, discussed above. These increases were partially offset by increased advertising and promotional activities primarily to support holiday and promotional events and new product launches.\nPartially offsetting these increases in operating income were higher general and administrative expenses, primarily due to increased employee incentive compensation from the prior-year period, which reflected lower accrued employee incentive compensation attributable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on performance, as well as acquisition-related expenses, primarily related to DECIEM's stock options of $40 million. See\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –\nNote 18 –\nStock Plans\nfor additional information relating to DECIEM stock options.\nMakeup\n(1)\nSee\n“Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nReported makeup operating results increased in fiscal 2021, driven by the favorable year-over-year comparison of goodwill and other intangible asset impairments related to Too Faced, BECCA and Smashbox, combined, of $1,120 million and freestanding store long-lived asset impairments relating to COVID-19 of approximately $108 million.\nPartially offsetting the decreases in operating loss were lower results from M·A·C primarily due to the decrease in net sales, offset by lower selling expense and store operating costs, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on brick-and-mortar retail locations, discussed above.\nFragrance\n(1)\nSee\n“Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nReported fragrance operating results increased in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by higher results from Tom Ford Beauty and Jo Malone London, combined, of approximately $183 million. The increase in operating results from these brands reflected higher net sales, partially offset by increased advertising and promotional activities primarily to support holiday and promotional events and new product launches.\n42\nPartially offsetting these increases in operating income were higher general and administrative expenses, primarily due to increased employee incentive compensation from the prior-year period, which reflected lower accrued employee incentive compensation attributable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on performance.\nHair Care\n(1)\nSee\n“Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nReported hair care operating results in fiscal 2021 were flat as compared to the prior-year period. Fiscal 2021 operating results reflected higher general and administrative expenses primarily due to increased employee incentive compensation from the prior-year period, which reflected lower accrued employee incentive compensation attributable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on performance. This decrease in operating results in fiscal 2021 is partially offset by higher operating results from Aveda, primarily driven by higher net sales, and the favorable year-over-year impact of freestanding store long-lived asset impairments relating to COVID-19 of approximately $10 million.\nGeographic Regions\nThe Americas\n(1)\nSee\n“Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nReported operating results in The Americas increased in fiscal 2021, primarily due to the favorable year-over-year comparison of goodwill, other intangible and freestanding store long-lived asset impairments and the change in fair value of contingent consideration of $1,167 million.  The increase in operating results also reflected higher intercompany royalty income primarily from the growth in our travel retail business, as well as lower selling expenses due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on brick-and-mortar retail locations, discussed above.\nPartially offsetting these increases in operating results were higher general and administrative expenses, primarily due to increased employee incentive compensation from the prior-year period, which reflected lower accrued employee incentive compensation attributable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on performance, and increased advertising and promotional activities primarily to support holiday and promotional events.\n43\nEurope, the Middle East & Africa\n(1)\nSee\n“Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nReported operating results in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by higher results from our travel retail business and France, combined, of approximately $247 million, reflecting disciplined expense management, and higher nets sales from our travel retail business. The increase in fiscal 2021 operating results also benefited from the favorable year-over-year comparison of freestanding store long-lived asset impairments relating to COVID-19 of $56 million.\nAsia/Pacific\n(1)\nSee\n“Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbeginning on page 47 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nReported operating income in Asia/Pacific increased in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by higher results from mainland China and Korea, combined, of approximately $227 million, reflecting the increase in net sales. The increase in net sales in mainland China was partially offset by the increase in advertising and promotional expense, primarily due to investments to support holiday events and campaigns and new product launches and a difficult comparison to the prior-year period that reflected cost saving actions implemented in response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPartially offsetting the increase in operating income was lower results from Japan, reflecting the decrease in net sales.\nINTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME\nInterest expense increased in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt in November 2019, April 2020 and March 2021, partially offset by the favorable impact from interest rate swaps.\n44\nInterest income and investment income, net increased reflecting higher equity method investment income from our minority investments, partially offset by decreases in investment income due to lower interest rates.\nOTHER INCOME, NET\nOn May 18, 2021, we acquired additional shares in DECIEM, a Toronto-based skin care company, for $1,092 million in cash, including proceeds from the issuance of debt. DECIEM is a multi-brand beauty company with a brand portfolio that includes The Ordinary and NIOD. This acquisition is expected to further strengthen our leadership position in prestige skin care, expand our global consumer reach and complement our business in the online and specialty-multi channels. We originally acquired a minority interest in DECIEM in June 2017. The minority interest was accounted for as an equity method investment, which had a carrying value of $65 million at the acquisition date. The acquisition of additional shares increased our fully diluted equity interest from approximately 29% to approximately 76% and was considered a step acquisition. On a fully diluted basis, the DECIEM stock options approximated 4% of the total capital structure. Accordingly, for purposes of determining the consideration transferred, we excluded the DECIEM stock options, which resulted in an increase in our post-acquisition undiluted equity interest from approximately 30% to approximately 78% and the post-acquisition undiluted equity interest of the remaining noncontrolling interest holders of approximately 22%. We remeasured the previously held equity method investment to its fair value of $912 million, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $847 million. The gain on our previously held equity method investment is included in Other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2021. As part of the increase in our investment, we were granted the right to purchase (Call Option), and granted the remaining investors a right to sell to us (Put Option), the remaining interests after a three-year period, with a purchase price based on the future performance of DECIEM (the net Put (Call) Option). As a result of this redemption feature, we recorded redeemable noncontrolling interest, at its acquisition‑date fair value, that is classified as mezzanine equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2021.\nSee\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –\nNote 5 –\nAcquisition of Businesses\nfor additional information.\nOn December 18, 2019, we acquired the remaining equity interest in Have&Be Co. Ltd. (“Have & Be”), the global skin care company behind Dr. Jart+ and men’s grooming brand Do The Right Thing, for $1,268 million in cash. Based on the final purchase price and working capital adjustments, we estimated a refund receivable of $32 million that was outstanding as of June 30, 2020 and was received in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We originally acquired a minority interest in Have & Be in December 2015, which included a formula-based call option for the remaining equity interest. The original minority interest was accounted for as an equity method investment, which had a carrying value of $133 million at the acquisition date. The acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Have & Be was considered a step acquisition, whereby we remeasured the previously held equity method investment to its fair value of $660 million, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $530 million. The acquisition of the remaining equity interest also resulted in the recognition of a previously unrealized foreign currency gain of $4 million, which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income. The total gain on our previously held equity method investment of $534 million is included in Other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nThe amount paid at closing was funded by cash on hand including the proceeds from the issuance of debt. In anticipation of the closing, we transferred cash to a foreign subsidiary for purposes of making the closing payment. As a result, we recognized a foreign currency gain of $23 million, which is also included in Other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, presented us with opportunities to manage cash and investments more efficiently on a global basis. Accordingly, during fiscal 2019, as part of the assessment of those opportunities, we sold our available-for-sale securities, which liquidated our investment in the foreign subsidiary that owned those securities. As a result, we recorded a realized foreign currency gain on liquidation of $77 million and a gross loss on the sale of available-for-sale securities of $6 million, both of which were reclassified from accumulated OCI and are reflected in Other income, net for the year ended June 30, 2019. See\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –\nNote 2\n– Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Transactions\nfor further information.\n45\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\nThe provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the tax impact of share-based compensation, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations. Our effective tax rate will change from year-to-year based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the tax impact of share-based compensation, the interaction of various global tax strategies and the impact from certain acquisitions.\nThe TCJA included broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that impacted our accounting and reporting for income taxes. See\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 9 – Income Taxes\nfor further discussion relating to the TCJA.\n(1)\nFor fiscal 2021 and 2020, the basis-point change in our effective tax rate was materially impacted by the increase from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 and the decrease from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020, respectively, in earnings before income taxes.\n(2)\nFiscal 2021 and 2020 effective tax rates exclude the net impact on the effective tax rates of charges associated with restructuring and other activities, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, other income, net and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. There was no tax expense associated with the fiscal 2021 other income, net adjustment (previously held equity method investment in DECIEM). Fiscal 2021 was also adjusted to exclude the DECIEM stock option expense.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 decreased approximately 1,980 basis points. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower effective tax rate on our foreign operations of approximately 920 basis points, which included the impact of the U.S. government issuance of final global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) tax regulations in July 2020 under the TCJA that provide for a high-tax exception to the current and applicable prior years’ GILTI tax, the impact of the gain on our previously held equity method investment in DECIEM with no associated tax expense of approximately 530 basis points, as well as the prior-year impact of nondeductible goodwill impairment charges associated with our Too Faced, BECCA and Smashbox reporting units of approximately 790 basis points. Partially offsetting these decreases was a decrease in excess tax benefit credits related to stock-based compensation arrangements of approximately 450 basis points.\n46\nNET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\n(1)\nSee\n“Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbelow for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period, or do not reflect the Company’s underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our operating performance from period to period. In the future, we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented below; however, the impact to the Company’s results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies. While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The following tables present Net sales, Operating income and Diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities; goodwill and other intangible asset impairments; long-lived asset impairments relating to COVID-19; other income, net; the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; acquisition-related stock option expense; and the effects of foreign currency translation. The tables provide reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n47\nAs diluted net earnings per common share, as adjusted, is used as a measure of the Company’s performance, we consider the impact of current and deferred income taxes when calculating the per-share impact of each of the reconciling items.\n48\nThe following table reconciles the change in net sales by product category and geographic region, as reported, to the change in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation:\n49\nThe following table reconciles the change in operating income by product category and geographic region, as reported, to the change in operating income excluding the impact of goodwill, other intangible and long-lived asset impairments, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and acquisition-related stock option expense:\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nOur principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad. At June 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4,958 million compared with $5,022 million at June 30, 2020. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions. To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength, and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support seasonal working capital needs, currently planned business operations, information technology enhancements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, restructuring initiatives, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.\nThe TCJA resulted in the Transition Tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional U.S. federal income tax. As a result, we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings, and we continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our remaining applicable foreign earnings. We do not believe that continuing to reinvest our foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations. If these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions.\n50\nThe effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years, however we are mindful of emerging inflationary pressures. Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate.\nCredit Ratings\nChanges in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs. Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility. Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. As of August 20, 2021, our long-term debt is rated A+ with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s and A1 with a stable outlook by Moody’s.\nDebt and Access to Liquidity\nTotal debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) decreased to 48% at June 30, 2021 from 61% at June 30, 2020, primarily due to the increase in total equity reflecting an increase in net earnings, partially offset by a higher treasury stock balance. Also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in total debt, primarily due to the fiscal 2021 repayments of the $750 million outstanding under our $1,500 million revolving credit facility and the $450 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.70% Senior Notes due May 10, 2021, partially offset by the March 2021 issuance of $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.950% Senior Notes due March 15, 2031.\nFor further information regarding our current and long-term debt and available financing, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11 – Debt\n.\nCash Flows\nThe change in net cash flows from operations reflected higher earnings before taxes, excluding non-cash items, as well as the improvement in working capital. The improvement in working capital was primarily due to other accrued liabilities, including an increase in accrued employee incentive compensation and the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts, and accounts payable, partially offset by the unfavorable change in accounts receivable due primarily to the increase in net sales.\nThe change in net cash flows used for investing activities primarily reflected the settlement of net investment hedges, which is offset by the improvement in other accrued liabilities discussed above. Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 included cash paid, net of cash acquired, in connection with the acquisition of additional shares in DECIEM and the acquisition of Have & Be, respectively.\nThe change in net cash flows from financing activities primarily reflected lower proceeds relating to the issuance of long-term debt (the November 2019 and April 2020 issuances in fiscal 2020, compared to the March 2021 issuance in fiscal 2021), the fiscal 2021 repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by lower treasury stock repurchases.\nSee\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition\nof the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 for the fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2019 comparative discussions.\nDividends\nFor a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during the year ended June 30, 2021 and through August 20, 2021, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17 – Common Stock\n.\n51\nPension and Post-retirement Plan Funding\nSeveral factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans. For our domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Qualified Plan”), we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages. For any future contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (“ERISA”) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations. In addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions\n.\nThe effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.\nFor the U.S. Qualified Plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities. This strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio. For fiscal 2021 and 2020, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under ERISA regulations for the U.S. Qualified Plan. As we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make cash contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the United States during fiscal 2022.\nThe following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and post-retirement plans:\nCommitments and Contingencies\nFor a discussion of our contingencies, see to\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies (Contractual Obligations)\n.\nContractual Obligations\nFor a discussion of our contractual obligations, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies (Contractual Obligations)\n.\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nFor a discussion of our derivative financial instruments and hedging activities, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 12 – Derivative Financial Instruments\n.\nForeign Exchange Risk Management\nFor a discussion of foreign exchange risk management, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 12 – Derivative Financial Instruments (Cash Flow Hedges, Net Investment Hedges)\n.\nCredit Risk\nFor a discussion of credit risk, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 12 – Derivative Financial Instruments (Credit Risk)\n.\nMarket Risk\nWe address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. To perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $218 million and $222 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures.\n52\nIn addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio, including future debt issuances. Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would increase (decrease) by approximately $(83) million and $9 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOur sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year. We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRefer to\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nfor discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition at June 30, 2021 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Company’s financial condition. Our critical accounting policies relate to goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets - impairment assessment, income taxes and business combinations.\nManagement of the Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets – Impairment Assessment\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.\nWhen testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If necessary, we can perform a single step quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. For fiscal 2021 and 2020, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value. For our other reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, a quantitative assessment was performed. We engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management.\nFor further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n,\nNote 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nand\nNote 7 – Leases\n.\n53\nIncome Taxes\nWe calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. As the application of various tax laws relevant to our global business is often uncertain, significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, net operating losses, tax credit and other carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies. If our assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time, while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.\nWe provide tax reserves for applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit. The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. We assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. We classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures. If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings.\nFor further discussion of Income Taxes, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nand\nNote 9 – Income Taxes\n.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe use the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, our consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition. We allocate the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The determination of fair value, as well as the expected useful lives of certain assets acquired, requires management to make judgements and may involve the use of significant estimates, including assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows, discount rates and valuation multiples from comparable publicly traded companies, among other things. Management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\n54\nDuring fiscal 2021, we increased our investment in Deciem Beauty Group Inc. (“DECIEM”) on a fully diluted basis from approximately 29% to approximately 76%.\nOn a fully diluted basis, the DECIEM employee stock options, approximated 4% of the total capital structure and represent a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, for purposes of determining the consideration transferred, we excluded the DECIEM stock options, which resulted in an increase in our post-acquisition undiluted equity interest from approximately 30% to approximately 78% and the post-acquisition undiluted equity interest of the remaining noncontrolling interest holders of approximately 22%.\nWe originally acquired a minority interest in DECIEM in June 2017. The original minority interest was accounted for as a cost method investment and, in June 2020, we began to apply the equity method of accounting but we did not have to remeasure our investment in DECIEM since the passage of time does not constitute an observable price change. The acquisition of the increased equity interest in DECIEM was considered a step acquisition, whereby we remeasured the previously held equity method investment to its fair value, resulting in the recognition of a non-cash gain. The acquisition-date fair value of the previously held equity method investment was calculated by multiplying the gross-up of the total consideration for the acquired ownership interest of $2,988 million by the related effective previously held equity interest of approximately 30.5%.\nThe acquisition-date fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest includes the acquisition-date fair value of the net Put (Call) Option of $234 million. The remaining acquisition-date fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest of $647 million was calculated by multiplying the gross-up of the total consideration for the acquired ownership interest of $2,988 million by the related noncontrolling interest of approximately 21.6%. As part of the acquisition of additional shares, DECIEM stock options were issued in replacement of and exchange for certain vested and unvested stock options previously issued by DECIEM. The total fair value of the DECIEM stock options of $294 million was recorded as part of the total consideration transferred, comp\nrising of $191 m\nillion of Cash paid for vested options settled as of the acquisition date and $103 million reported as a stock options liability on the consolidated balance sheet as it is not an assumed liability of DECIEM and is expected to be settled in cash upon completion of the exercise of the Put (Call). The acquisition-date fair value of the DECIEM stock options liability was calculated by multiplying the acquisition-date fair value by the number of DECIEM stock options replaced the day after the acquisition date.\nThe stock options replaced consist of vested and partially vested stock options.\nWe recorded a preliminary allocation of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value at the acquisition date. The total consideration transferred includes the cash paid at closing, the fair value of its previously held equity method investment, the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest\n, including the fair value of the net Put (Call) Option,\nand the fair value of the DECIEM stock options liability.\nThe excess of the total consideration transferred over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.\nFor further discussion of Business Combinations, see\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5 – Acquisition of Businesses\nand\nNote 18 – Stock Programs\n.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nWe and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including in this and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders, which may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(including its subsidiaries) (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021. SEC guidance permits companies to exclude certain acquisitions from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year following the acquisition. Accordingly, management excluded the internal controls relating to Deciem Beauty Group Inc. (“DECIEM”) from its fiscal 2021 annual assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. On May 18, 2021, the Company increased its ownership interest in DECIEM from approximately 29% to approximately 76%. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, DECIEM's financial results constitute approximately 0.4% of total net sales and 2% of total assets of the consolidated financial statement amounts.\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company’s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2021, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.”\nAugust 27, 2021\nF-2\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity and redeemable noncontrolling interest, and of cash flows for the year then ended, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for the year\nended June 30, 2021 appearing on page S-1 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nF-3\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Deciem Beauty Group Inc. (“DECIEM”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021. The Company increased its ownership interest in DECIEM from approximately 29% to approximately 76% in May 2021, resulting in the entity becoming a consolidated subsidiary. We have also excluded DECIEM from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. DECIEM’s total assets and total net sales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 2% and 0.4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below\nare matters\narising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nIndefinite-Lived Impairment Assessment - Dr. Jart+ Trademark\nAs described in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated net indefinite-lived intangible assets balance was $2,366 million as of June 30, 2021, of which a portion relates to the Dr. Jart+ trademark.  Management assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.\nThe quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.\nIf the\ncarrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.\nTo determine the estimated fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, management uses an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method.\nThe significant assumptions used in this approach include revenue growth rates, terminal value, weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and royalty rate.\nF-4\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Dr. Jart+ trademark impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value estimate of the trademark; (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to\nrevenue growth rates, terminal value, weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and royalty rate; and (iii)\nthe audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Dr. Jart+ trademark. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for determining the fair value estimate; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the relief-from-royalty method; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the fair value estimate; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to\nrevenue growth rates, terminal value, weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and royalty rate\n. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to\nrevenue growth rates\ninvolved evaluating whether the assumptions were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Dr. Jart+ brand; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the relief-from-royalty method and (ii) the reasonableness of the terminal value,\nweighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and royalty rate assumptions\n.\nAcquisition of DECIEM - Valuation of Intangible Assets and net Put (Call) Option\nAs described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2021, the Company acquired additional shares in Deciem Beauty Group Inc. (“DECIEM”) for $1,092 million in cash, including proceeds from the issuance of debt, which resulted in recording $1,917 million of customer relationships and trademark intangible assets.  The Company was granted the right to purchase (“Call Option”), and granted the remaining investors a right to sell to the Company (“Put Option”), the remaining interests, with a purchase price based on the future performance of DECIEM (the “net Put (Call) Option”).  As a result of this redemption feature, management recorded redeemable noncontrolling interest, at its acquisition-date fair value, that is classified as mezzanine equity in the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe acquisition-date fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest includes the acquisition-date fair value of the net Put (Call) Option of $234 million.\nTo determine the acquisition-date estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired, management applied the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships and the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks.  The significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and a customer attrition rate for customer relationships, and royalty rates for trademarks. The acquisition-date fair value of the net Put (Call) Option is based on the M\nonte Carlo method.\nThe significan\nt\nassumptions used include starting equity value, revenue growth rates and EBITDA, risk free rate, term, operating leverage adjustment, net sales discount\nrate\n, EBITDA discount rate, EBITDA volatility, and net sales volatility.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of acquired intangible assets and the net Put (Call) Option relating to the acquisition of DECIEM is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value estimates of the acquired intangible assets and the net Put (Call) Option; (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows for customer relationships, and revenue growth rates, terminal values, weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and royalty rates for trademarks,\nand starting equity value, revenue growth rates and EBITDA, risk free rate, term, operating leverage adjustment, net sales discount\nrate\n, EBITDA discount rate, EBITDA volatility, and net sales volatility for the net Put (Call) Option; and (iii)\nthe audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nF-5\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the accounting for business combinations, including controls over management’s valuation of the intangible assets and net Put (Call) Option.  These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for determining the fair value estimates of the intangible assets and net Put (Call) option; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships, the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks, and the Monte Carlo method for the net Put (Call) Option; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the fair value estimates; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to\nrevenue growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows for customer relationships, and revenue growth rates, terminal values, weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and royalty rate\ns\nfor trademarks\n. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenue growth rates for customer relationships, and revenue growth rates and terminal values for trademarks involved evaluating whether the assumptions were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of DECIEM; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating the appropriateness of the Monte Carlo method and management’s assumptions related to the net Put (Call Option)\ninvolved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing\nan independent value for each option and comparing to management’s estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimate. Developing an independent value for each option involved developing an independent Monte Carlo simulation model, testing the completeness and accuracy of the contractual information used by management to calculate the agreed-upon price to acquire the remaining equity interests in DECIEM, and evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions used by management to estimate DECIEM’s equity value. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were also used to assist in (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the Company’s multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships and relief-from-royalty method for trademarks; and (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the\nweighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates assumptions.\nF-6\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two‑year period ended June 30, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two‑year period ended June 30, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases effective July 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nF-7\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-8\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-9\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-10\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EQUITY AND REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-11\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-12\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 -\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc. manufactures, markets and sells skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products around the world. Products are marketed under brand names, including: Estée Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Lab Series, Origins, M·A·C, Bobbi Brown\n,\nLa Mer\n,\nAveda, Jo Malone London, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, Smashbox, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, GLAMGLOW, Kilian Paris, Too Faced, Dr. Jart+, DECIEM and The Ordinary. Certain subsidiaries of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. are also the global licensee of the Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, Ermenegildo Zegna and AERIN brand names for fragrances and/or cosmetics.\nNOTE 2 –\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nCertain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\nManagement Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, business combinations, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, income taxes, redeemable noncontrolling interest and Deciem Beauty Group Inc. (“DECIEM”) stock options. Management evaluates the related estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment, including those related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nCurrency Translation and Transactions\nAll assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at monthly average rates of exchange for the period. Unrealized translation gains (losses), net of tax, reported as translation adjustments through other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. were $\n147\nmillion, $(\n106\n) million and $\n30\nmillion, net of tax, in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the Company’s subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Remeasurement adjustments in financial statements in a highly inflationary economy and other transactional gains and losses are reflected in earnings. These subsidiaries are not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements or liquidity in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company had an investment in a foreign subsidiary that owned the Company’s available-for-sale securities, and the Company sold its available-for-sale securities, which liquidated this investment in the foreign subsidiary. As a result, the Company recorded a realized foreign currency gain on liquidation of $\n77\nmillion and a gross loss on the sale of available-for-sale securities of $\n6\nmillion, both of which were reclassified from accumulated OCI (“AOCI”) to Other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings.\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations, which are designated as net investment hedges.\nF-13\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSee\nNote 12 – Derivative Financial Instruments\nfor further discussion\n.\nThe Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.\nThe accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions of $(\n12\n) million, $\n51\nmillion and $\n46\nmillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include $\n1,490\nmillion and $\n775\nmillion of short-term time deposits at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nInvestments\nInvestments in the common stock of privately-held companies in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company accounts for its equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, plus/minus subsequent observable price changes, and performs an assessment each quarter to determine whether or not a triggering event has occurred that results in changes in fair value. These investments were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 and are included in Long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable, net is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions. Payment terms are short-term in nature and are generally less than one year.\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326 – Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“ASC 326”) using the modified retrospective transition approach and, accordingly, the prior comparative period was not restated. Under this new standard, the Company is required to measure credit losses based on the Company’s estimate of expected losses rather than incurred losses, which generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company evaluated certain criteria, including aging and historical write-offs, current economic condition of specific customers and future economic conditions of countries utilizing a consumption index to determine the appropriate allowance for credit losses. The Company writes-off receivables once it is determined that the receivables are no longer collectible and as allowed by local laws.  As a result of the adoption of ASC 326, the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment of approximately $\n3\nmillion, net of tax, as a reduction to its fiscal 2021 opening balance of retained earnings relating to its trade receivables. See\nNote 14 – Revenue Recognition\nfor additional information.\nInventory and Promotional Merchandise\nInventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and warehousing) as well as inbound freight. Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity. Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred. Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company’s customers. Included in inventory and promotional merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age and historical results. In addition, and as necessary, specific reserves for future known or anticipated events may be established.\nF-14\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. All derivatives are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value” hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), or (iii) not designated as a hedging instrument. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments). Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction are recorded in OCI. Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings). Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings. All derivative gains and losses relating to cash flow hedges and fair value hedges are recognized in the same income statement line as the hedged items. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations, which are designated as net investment hedges. See\nNote 12 – Derivative Financial Instruments\nfor further discussion.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset’s useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and expensed as incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages. For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from\n3\nto\n40\nyears.  Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The determination of fair value, as well as the expected useful lives of certain assets acquired, requires management to make judgments and may involve the use of significant estimates, including assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows, discount rates and valuation multiples from comparable publicly traded companies, among other things. See\nNote 5 – Acquisition of Businesses\nfor further information.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.\nF-15\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company’s operating segments. The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company uses a single quantitative step when determining the subsequent measurement of goodwill by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recording an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. When testing other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company also has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative test. The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.\nFor fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for the goodwill in certain of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of its reporting units were below carrying value. The Company considered macroeconomic factors including the global economic growth, general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which the reporting units operate and the intangible assets are employed, and the growth of the global prestige beauty industry. In addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other things, the Company considered the reporting units’ current results and forecasts, any changes in the nature of the business, any significant legal, regulatory, contractual, political or other business climate factors, changes in the industry/competitive environment, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and its intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of a trademark.\nFor the Company’s other reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, a quantitative assessment was performed. The Company engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management. To determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units, the Company used an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we determined fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflected the relative risk of the cash flows. Under the market approach, we utilized market multiples from publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The significant assumptions used in these two approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples. To determine the estimated fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we use an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third-party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. The significant assumptions used in this approach include revenue growth rates, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rate.\nSee\nNote 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nfor further information.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, primarily intangible assets subject to amortization, right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be measured and recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Specifically for right-of-use assets, estimated fair value is based on discounting market rent using a real estate discount rate.\nF-16\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLeases\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company adopted the lease accounting standard, ASC Topic 842 – Leases (“ASC 842”) using the modified retrospective transition approach permitted under the new standard for leases that existed at July 1, 2019 and, accordingly, the prior comparative periods were not restated.\nThe Company recognizes a lease liability and a related right-of-use (“ROU”) asset at the commencement date for leases on its consolidated balance sheet, excluding short-term leases as noted below. The lease liability is equal to the present value of unpaid lease payments over the remaining lease term. The Company’s lease term at the commencement date may reflect options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. To determine the present value of the lease liability, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate, which is defined as the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow (on a collateralized basis over a similar term) an amount equal to the lease payments in similar economic environments. The ROU asset is based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for certain costs such as initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments and lease incentives received. Both operating and finance lease ROU assets are reviewed for impairment, consistent with other long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. After an ROU asset is impaired, any remaining balance of the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life.\nAfter the lease commencement date, the Company evaluates lease modifications, if any, that could result in a change in the accounting for leases. For a lease modification, an evaluation is performed to determine if it should be treated as either a separate lease or a change in the accounting of an existing lease. In addition, significant changes in events or circumstances within the Company’s control are assessed to determine whether a change in the accounting for leases is required.\nCertain of the Company’s leases provide for variable lease payments for the right to use an underlying asset that vary due to changes in facts and circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. Variable lease payments that are dependent on an index or rate (e.g., Consumer Price Index) are included in the initial measurement of the lease liability, the initial measurement of the ROU asset, and the lease classification test based on the index or rate as of the commencement date. Any changes from the commencement date estimation of the index- and rate-based variable payments are expensed as incurred in the period of the change. Variable lease payments that are not known at the commencement date and are determinable based on the performance or use of the underlying asset\n,\nare not included in the initial measurement of the lease liability or the ROU asset, but instead are expensed as incurred. The Company’s variable lease payments primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, common area maintenance based on the percentage of the total square footage leased by the Company, as well as costs relating to embedded leases, such as third-party manufacturing agreements.\nUpon the adoption of ASC 842, the Company made the following accounting policy elections:\n•\nCertain of the Company’s contracts contain lease components as well as non-lease components, such as an agreement to purchase services. Unless an accounting policy is elected to the contrary, the contract consideration must be allocated to the separate lease and non-lease components in accordance with ASC 842. For purposes of allocating contract consideration, the Company elected not to separate the lease components from non-lease components for all asset classes. This was applied to all existing leases as of July 1, 2019 and will be applied to new leases on an ongoing basis.\n•\nThe Company elected not to apply the measurement and recognition requirements of ASC 842 to short-term leases (i.e. leases with a term of 12 months or less). Accordingly, short-term leases will not be recorded as ROU assets or lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, and the related lease payments will be recognized in net earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n•\nFor certain leases relating to automobiles, information technology equipment and office equipment, the Company elected to apply the guidance of ASC 842 utilizing a portfolio approach. Under this approach, the Company combined and accounted for leases (as a portfolio) with similar characteristics (e.g., lease term, discount rates, etc.) as a single lease, provided its application is not materially different when compared to the application at the individual lease level.\nAs a result of the adoption of ASC 842, the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment of $\n29\nmillion, net of tax, as a reduction to its fiscal 2020 opening balance of retained earnings, primarily to reflect the fair value of operating lease ROU assets that were impaired at, or prior to, the adoption date. In addition, the Company recognized operating lease ROU assets and liabilities of $\n2,598\nmillion and $\n2,764\nmillion, respectively, as of July 1, 2019. See\nNote\n7\n– Leases\nfor further information.\nF-17\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and seller of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. The Company’s sales subject to credit risk are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries, specialty multi-brand retailers and retailers in its travel retail business. The Company grants credit to qualified customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has enhanced its assessment of its customers' abilities to pay with a greater focus on factors affecting their liquidity and less on historical payment performance. While the Company does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk at this time, it continues to monitor the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its customers' abilities, individually and collectively, to make timely payments.\nThe Company’s largest customer for the year ended June 30, 2021 sells products primarily in China travel retail. This customer accounted for $\n2,278\nmillion or\n14\n%, $\n1,031\nmillion or\n7\n% and $\n694\nmillion or\n5\n% of the Company's consolidated net sales for the year ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This customer accounted for $\n179\nmillion, or\n10\n%, and $\n297\nmillion, or\n24\n%, of the Company's accounts receivable at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company adopted the new revenue accounting standard, ASC 606, under the modified retrospective method to all contracts as of the date of adoption. Under this method, the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue accounting standard.\nChanges in Accounting Policies\nAs a result of the fiscal 2019 adoption of ASC 606, the Company changed its accounting policies for revenue recognition as follows:\n•\nFor products sold that qualify for customer loyalty program awards, the Company defers a portion of revenue related to the product sales. Previously, the Company recognized revenue in full for product sales and accrued for the expected amounts of loyalty awards to be provided under the incremental cost approach.\n•\nA portion of revenue is deferred for shipments of saleable products with separate performance obligations to provide gift with purchase and purchase with purchase promotional products, and is recognized as control is transferred to a customer. Previously, the Company recognized revenue for saleable products and purchase with purchase products based upon invoice prices charged to customers and included the cost of gift with purchase products and/or purchase with purchase products in Cost of sales when risks and rewards of ownership transferred to the Company’s customer (i.e. a third-party retailer).\n•\nThe cost of certain promotional products, including samples and testers, are classified within Cost of sales. Such costs were previously accounted for as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n•\nIn conjunction with the adoption of ASC 606, the Company reassessed its contracts under the variable consideration guidance, including the payments to customer guidance, and as a result certain reclassifications were made related to the timing and classification of certain net demonstration payments to and from customers.\n•\nFor product returns, the Company established a sales return accrual and a corresponding asset for the right to recover goods in Other accrued liabilities and Inventory and promotional merchandise, net, respectively, while previously the net liability for product returns was recorded as a reduction of Accounts receivable, net.\nIn addition, the Company adopted the policy election to exclude from the transaction price all amounts collected from customers for sales and other taxes.\nAs a result of the change in accounting policies noted above, the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment of $\n229\nmillion, net of tax, as a reduction to its fiscal 2019 opening balance of retained earnings.\nSee\nNote 14 – Revenue Recognition\nfor further discussion\n.\nFor revenue disaggregated by product category and geographic region, see\nNote 22 – Segment Data and Related Information\n.\nF-18\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAdvertising and Promotion\nGlobal net advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development expenses of $\n3,710\nmillion, $\n3,398\nmillion and $\n3,440\nmillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and are expensed as incurred. The cost of certain promotional products, including samples and testers, are classified within Cost of sales.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs of $\n243\nmillion, $\n228\nmillion and $\n202\nmillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and are expensed as incurred.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling expenses of $\n680\nmillion, $\n583\nmillion and $\n570\nmillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and include distribution center costs, promotional shipping costs, third-party logistics costs and outbound freight.\nLicense Arrangements\nThe Company’s license agreements provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors’ trademarks. The current licenses have an initial term of approximately\n5\nyears to\n10\nyears, and are renewable subject to the Company’s compliance with the license agreement provisions. Most of our license agreements have renewal terms in\n5\n-year increments. As of June 30, 2021, the remaining terms considering available renewal periods range from\n2\nyears to approximately\n12\nyears. Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.\nSome of the Company’s licenses were entered into to create a new business, while other licenses were acquired, or entered into, where the licensor or another licensee was operating a pre-existing beauty products business, in which case, other intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives.\nCertain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities. Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation, measured at the fair value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, as an expense in the consolidated financial statements and accrues for estimated forfeitures each quarter. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based compensation awards are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which it operates. As the application of various tax laws relevant to the Company’s global business is often uncertain, significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s annual tax expense and in evaluating the Company’s tax positions. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions.\nF-19\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, net operating losses, tax credit and other carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company regularly reviews deferred tax assets for realizability and establishes valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies. If the Company’s assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time, while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.\nThe Company provides tax reserves for applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit. The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures. If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated net earnings.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nOn May 18, 2021, the Company acquired additional shares in Deciem Beauty Group Inc. (\n“DECIEM”\n), a Toronto-based skin care company. The Company originally acquired a minority interest in DECIEM in June 2017. The acquisition of additional shares increased the Company's equity interest and was considered a step acquisition. As part of the increase in the Company's investment, the Company was granted the right to purchase (“Call Option”), and granted the remaining investors a right to sell to the Company (“Put Option”), the remaining interests after a\nthree-year\nperiod, with a purchase price based on the future performance of DECIEM (the “net Put (Call) Option”).\nAs a result of this redemption feature, the Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interest, at its acquisition‑date fair value, that is classified as mezzanine equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2021. The noncontrolling interest is adjusted each reporting period for income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Each reporting period, a measurement period adjustment, if any, is then recorded to adjust the noncontrolling interest to the higher of either the redemption value, assuming it was redeemable at the reporting date, or its carrying value. These adjustments are recorded in Paid-in capital and are not reflected in Net earnings or Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. In addition, based on the Company's policy election, if the redemption value exceeds the fair value of the noncontrolling interest on a cumulative basis, a measurement period adjustment is recorded in Retained earnings and the Company will adjust Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. as it uses the two-class method when calculating earnings per common share. The fair value of the noncontrolling interest is estimated using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, the Company determines fair value using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of the reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflected the relative risk of the cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company utilizes market multiples from publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The significant assumptions used in these two approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal value, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and comparable market multiples. See\nNote 5 – Acquisition of Businesses\nfor additional information regarding the redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nF-20\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGovernment Assistance\nThe Company recognizes amounts received from government assistance programs as a reduction to cost of sales or operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings when there is reasonable assurance the Company will receive the amount and has met the conditions, if any, required by the government assistance program. Beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020, many governments in locations where the Company operates announced programs to assist employers whose businesses were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including programs that provide rebates to incentivize employers to maintain employees on payroll who were unable to work for their usual number of hours.\nDuring fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company qualified for and recorded $\n84\nmillion and $\n99\nmillion, respectively, in government assistance, which reduced Selling, general and administrative expenses by $\n78\nmillion and $\n87\nmillion, respectively, and Cost of sales by $\n6\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion, respectively. The remaining $\n2\nmillion recorded in fiscal 2020 was deferred and recognized in fiscal 2021 as a reduction to Cost of sales.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASC Topic 326\n–\nFinancial Instruments\n–\nCredit Losses) (“ASC 326”)\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance that requires companies to utilize an impairment model for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other financial instruments, which include trade and other receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, to record an allowance for credit risk based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. In addition, this guidance changes the recognition method for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities, which can occur as a result of market and credit risk, and requires additional disclosures. In general, modified retrospective adoption will be required for all outstanding instruments that fall under this guidance.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued authoritative guidance (ASU 2019-11\n–\nCodification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses) that amends ASC Topic 326 to clarify, improve and amend certain aspects of this guidance, such as disclosures related to accrued interest receivables and the estimation of credit losses associated with financial assets secured by collateral.\nIn February 2020, the FASB issued authoritative guidance (ASU 2020-02\n–\nFinancial Instruments\n–\nCredit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842)) that amends and clarifies Topic 326 and Topic 842. For Topic 326, the codification was updated to include the Securities and Exchange Commission staff interpretations associated with registrants engaged in lending activities.\nEffective for the Company –\nFiscal 2021 first quarter.\nImpact on consolidated financial statements\n–\nOn July 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC 326. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  See\nNote\n14\n- Revenue Recognition\nfor further discussion.\nGoodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (ASU 2018-15\n–\nIntangibles\n–\nGoodwill and Other\n–\nInternal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract)\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that permits companies to capitalize the costs incurred for setting up business systems that operate on cloud technology. The new guidance aligns the requirement for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The guidance does not affect the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. Capitalized costs associated with a hosting arrangement that is a service contract must be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement to the same line item in the income statement as the expense for fees for the hosting arrangement.\nEffective for the Company\n–\nFiscal 2021 first quarter, with early adoption permitted in any interim period. This guidance can be adopted either retrospectively, or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption.\nImpact on consolidated financial statements –\nOn July 1, 2020, the Company adopted this guidance prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nF-21\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nReference Rate Reform (ASC Topic 848)\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to provide optional relief for companies preparing for the discontinuation of interest rates such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), which is expected to be phased out at the end of calendar 2021, and applies to lease contracts, hedging instruments, held-to-maturity debt securities and debt arrangements that have LIBOR as the benchmark rate.\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that makes amendments to the new rules on accounting for reference rate reform. The amendments clarify that for all derivative instruments affected by the changes to interest rates used for discounting, margining or contract price alignment, regardless of whether they reference LIBOR or another rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform, an entity may apply certain practical expedients in ASC Topic 848.\nEffective for the Company\n– This guidance can be applied for a limited time through December 31, 2022. The guidance will no longer be available to apply after December 31, 2022.\nImpact on consolidated financial statements –\nThe Company currently has an implementation team in place that is performing a comprehensive evaluation and assessing the impact of applying this guidance on its existing derivative contracts, leases and other arrangements, as well as when to adopt this guidance.\nIncome Taxes (ASU 2019-12 – Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes)\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and making simplifications in other areas.\nEffective for the Company –\nFiscal 2022 first quarter. The amendments have differing adoption methods including retrospectively, prospectively and/or modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, depending on the specific change.\nImpact on consolidated financial statements\n– The Company is in the process of finalizing its evaluation and currently expects to record a cumulative adjustment of approximately\n$\n120\nmillion as an\nincrease to its fiscal 2022 opening retained earnings balance for deferred taxes related to a previously held equity method investment that became a foreign subsidiary.\nNo other recently issued accounting pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3 –\nINVENTORY AND PROMOTIONAL MERCHANDISE\nInventory and promotional merchandise consists of the following:\nF-22\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 4 –\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty, plant and equipment consists of the following:\nThe cost of assets related to projects in progress of $\n647\nmillion and $\n501\nmillion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, is included in their respective asset categories above. Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment was $\n516\nmillion, $\n514\nmillion and $\n495\nmillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s manufacturing process is included in Cost of sales and all other depreciation and amortization is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.\nSee\nNote 7 – Leases\nfor discussion of property, plant and equipment impairments.\nNOTE 5 –\nACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES\nFiscal 2021\nOn May 18, 2021, the Company acquired additional shares in DECIEM, a Toronto-based skin care company, for $\n1,092\nmillion in cash, including proceeds from the issuance of debt. DECIEM is a multi-brand beauty company with a brand portfolio that includes The Ordinary and NIOD. This acquisition is expected to further strengthen the Company’s leadership position in prestige skin care, expand its global consumer reach and complement its business in the online and specialty-multi channels. The Company originally acquired a minority interest in DECIEM in June 2017. The minority interest was accounted for as an equity method investment, which had a carrying value of $\n65\nmillion at the acquisition date. The acquisition of additional shares increased the Company's fully diluted equity interest from approximately\n29\n% to approximately\n76\n% and was considered a step acquisition. On a fully diluted basis, the DECIEM stock options, discussed below, approximated\n4\n% of the total capital structure. Accordingly, for purposes of determining the consideration transferred, the Company excluded the DECIEM stock options, which resulted in an increase in the Company’s post-acquisition undiluted equity interest from approximately\n30\n% to approximately\n78\n% and the post-acquisition undiluted equity interest of the remaining noncontrolling interest holders of approximately\n22\n%. The Company remeasured the previously held equity method investment to its fair value of $\n912\nmillion, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $\n847\nmillion. The gain on the Company’s previously held equity method investment is included in Other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2021. As part of the increase in the Company's investment, the Company was granted the right to purchase (“Call Option”), and granted the remaining investors a right to sell to the Company (“Put Option”), the remaining interests after a\nthree-year\nperiod, with a purchase price based on the future performance of DECIEM (the “net Put (Call) Option”). As a result of this redemption feature, the Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interest, at its acquisition‑date fair value, that is classified as mezzanine equity in  the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, the accounting for the DECIEM business combination is provisional pending the calculation of the final purchase price, finalization of the opening balance sheet, the final valuation report, and allocation of the total consideration transferred.\nF-23\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA summary of the total consideration transferred is as follows:\nAs part of the acquisition of additional shares, DECIEM stock options were issued in replacement of and exchange for certain vested and unvested stock options previously issued by DECIEM. The total fair value of the DECIEM stock options of $\n294\nmillion was recorded as part of the total consideration transferred, comprising of $\n191\nmillion of Cash paid for vested options settled as of the acquisition date and $\n103\nmillion reported as a stock options liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as it is not an assumed liability of DECIEM and is expected to be settled in cash upon completion of the exercise of the Put (Call). The acquisition-date fair value of the DECIEM stock options liability was calculated by multiplying the acquisition-date fair value by the number of DECIEM stock options replaced the day after the acquisition date. The stock options replaced consist of vested and partially vested stock options.  See\nNote 18 – Stock Programs\nfor information relating to the DECIEM stock options.\nThe acquisition-date fair value of the previously held equity method investment was calculated by multiplying the gross-up of the total consideration for the acquired ownership interest of $\n2,988\nmillion by the related effective previously held equity interest of approximately\n30.5\n%.\nThe acquisition-date fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest includes the acquisition-date fair value of the net Put (Call) Option of $\n234\nmillion. The remaining acquisition-date fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest of $\n647\nmillion was calculated by multiplying the gross-up of the total consideration for the acquired ownership interest of $\n2,988\nmillion by the related noncontrolling interest of approximately\n21.6\n%.\nThe acquisition-date fair values of the DECIEM stock options and the net Put (Call) Option were calculated by incorporating significant assumptions including the starting equity value, revenue growth rates and EBITDA and the following key assumptions into the Monte Carlo Method:\nF-24\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company recorded a preliminary allocation of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value at the acquisition date. The total consideration transferred includes the cash paid at closing, the fair value of its previously held equity method investment, the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest, including the fair value of the net Put (Call) Option, and the fair value of the DECIEM stock options liability. The excess of the total consideration transferred over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. To determine the acquisition date estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired, the Company applied the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships and the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks. The significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and a customer attrition rate for customer relationships and royalty rates for trademarks.\nThe preliminary allocation of the total consideration transferred has been recorded as follows:\nThe results of operations for DECIEM for the six-week period ended June 30, 2021 were not material to the Company's consolidated statements of earnings for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Acquisition-related costs of $\n21\nmillion, which primarily include financial advisory, accounting and legal fees, are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2021. Pro forma results of operations reflecting the acquisition of DECIEM are not presented, as the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial results would not have been material.\nF-25\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal 2020\nOn December 18, 2019, the Company acquired the remaining\n66.66\n% equity interest in Have&Be Co. Ltd. (“Have & Be”), the global skin care company behind Dr. Jart+ and men’s grooming brand Do The Right Thing, for $\n1,268\nmillion in cash. Based on the final purchase price and working capital adjustments, the Company estimated a refund receivable of $\n32\nmillion that was outstanding as of June 30, 2020 and was received in fiscal 2021. The Company originally acquired a minority interest in Have & Be in December 2015, and that investment structure included a formula-based call option for the remaining equity interest. The original minority interest was accounted for as an equity method investment, which had a carrying value of $\n133\nmillion at the acquisition date. The acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Have & Be was considered a step acquisition, whereby the Company remeasured the previously held equity method investment to its fair value of $\n660\nmillion, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $\n530\nmillion. The acquisition of the remaining equity interest also resulted in the recognition of a previously unrealized foreign currency gain of $\n4\nmillion, which was reclassified from accumulated OCI. The total gain on the Company’s previously held equity method investment of $\n534\nmillion is included in Other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for fiscal 2020. The fair value of the previously held equity method investment was determined based upon a valuation of the acquired business, as of the date of acquisition, using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies. The accounting for the Have & Be business combination was finalized as of June 30, 2020.\nThe amount paid at closing was funded by cash on hand including the proceeds from the issuance of debt. In anticipation of the closing, the Company transferred cash to a foreign subsidiary for purposes of making the closing payment. As a result, the Company recognized a foreign currency gain of $\n23\nmillion, which is also included in Other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nNOTE 6 –\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nAs previously discussed in\nNote 5 – Acquisition of Businesses\n, in May 2021 the Company increased its investment in DECIEM, which resulted in the inclusion of additional goodwill of $\n1,283\nmillion, amortizable intangible assets (customer lists) of $\n701\nmillion with amortization periods of\n7\nyears to\n14\nyears, and non-amortizable intangible assets (trademarks) of $\n1,216\nmillion. Goodwill associated with the acquisition is primarily attributable to the future revenue growth opportunities associated with sales growth in the skin care category, as well as the value associated with DECIEM's assembled workforce. As such, the goodwill has been allocated to the Company’s skin care product category. The goodwill recorded in connection with this acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes. These amounts are provisional pending the final purchase price, finalization of the opening balance sheet, the final valuation report, and allocation of the total consideration transferred.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company acquired Have & Be, which included the addition of goodwill of $\n346\nmillion, amortizable intangible assets (customer lists) of $\n937\nmillion with amortization periods of\n7.5\nyears to\n17.5\nyears, and non-amortizable intangible assets (trademarks) of $\n722\nmillion.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $\n6\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion, respectively, of goodwill associated with the continuing earn-out obligations related to the acquisition of the Bobbi Brown brand. The earn-out obligations ceased in fiscal 2021.\nThe intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of DECIEM and Have & Be are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The estimate of the fair values of the acquired amortizable intangible assets were determined using a multi-period excess earnings income approach by discounting the incremental after-tax cash flows over multiple periods. Fair value was determined under this approach by estimating future cash flows over multiple periods, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. The estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets not subject to amortization were determined using an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset.\nF-26\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGoodwill\nThe Company assigns goodwill of a reporting unit to the product categories in which that reporting unit operates at the time of acquisition.\nThe following table presents goodwill by product category and the related change in the carrying amount:\n(1)\nGoodwill impairment charges of $\n13\nmillion, recorded in connection with the exit of the global distribution of BECCA products, and $\n4\nmillion, other, are included in Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2021. See\nNote 8 – Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities\nfor further information relating to the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program. See “\nFiscal 2021 Impairment Testing\n” below for further information relating to fiscal 2021 impairment charges related to GLAMGLOW and Smashbox.\nF-27\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets include trademarks and patents, as well as license agreements and other intangible assets resulting from or related to businesses and assets purchased by the Company. Indefinite-lived intangible assets (e.g., trademarks) are not subject to amortization and are assessed at least annually for impairment during the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist. Other intangible assets (e.g., customer lists) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected period of benefit, approximately\n5\nyears to\n20\nyears. Intangible assets related to license agreements were amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on the terms of the respective agreements. The costs incurred and expensed by the Company to extend or renew the term of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were not significant to the Company’s results of operations.\nOther intangible assets consist of the following:\nThe aggregate amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n110\nmillion, $\n73\nmillion and $\n51\nmillion, respectively.\nThe estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is as follows:\nF-28\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal 2021 Impairment Testing\nThe Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.\nDuring November 2020, given the actual and the estimate of the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of COVID-19 impacting the Company and lower than expected results from geographic expansion, the Company made further revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its GLAMGLOW reporting unit. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of GLAMGLOW's long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim impairment test for the trademark and a recoverability test for the long-lived assets as of November 30, 2020. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark for GLAMGLOW exceeded its estimated fair value, which was determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows, and recorded an impairment charge of $\n21\nmillion. In addition, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the GLAMGLOW customer lists intangible asset was fully impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $\n6\nmillion. The fair value of all other long-lived assets of GLAMGLOW exceeded their carrying values and were not impaired as of November 30, 2020. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademark and customer lists intangible assets, the Company completed an interim quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n54\nmillion, reducing the carrying value of goodwill for the GLAMGLOW reporting unit to\nzero\n. The fair value of the GLAMGLOW reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit.\nBased on the Company’s annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2021, the Company determined that the carrying value of the GLAMGLOW and Smashbox trademarks exceeded their fair values. This determination was made based on updated internal forecasts, finalized and approved in June 2021, that reflected lower net sales growth projections due to a softer than expected retail environment for these brands, as well as the continued impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes in circumstances were also indicators that the carrying amounts of their respective long-lived assets may not be recoverable.

During March 2020, given the actual and the estimate of the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of COVID-19 impacting the Company, the Company made additional revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Too Faced, BECCA, Smashbox and GLAMGLOW reporting units. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in these reporting units triggered the need for an interim impairment review of their respective trademarks and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of their respective long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and recoverability tests for the long-lived assets as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. The Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were recoverable. For December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, the Company also concluded that the carrying values of the trademarks exceeded their estimated fair values and recorded impairment charges. For December 31, 2019, the Company utilized the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows, and for March 31, 2020, the relief-from-royalty method was based on probability weighted cash flows. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks, the Company completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill and recorded goodwill impairment charges for each of these reporting units. For December 31, 2019, the fair value of each reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit. For March 31, 2020, the fair value of each reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows, based on probability weighted undiscounted cash flows, and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit.\nBased on the Company’s annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2020, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle reporting unit exceeded its fair value. This determination was made based on updated internal forecasts, finalized and approved in June 2020, that reflected lower net sales growth projections due to a softer than expected retail environment for the brand, as well as the impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of COVID-19. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of its respective long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademarks exceeded its estimated fair value, which was determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows, and recorded impairment charges.

Some of the Company’s lease contracts include options to extend the leases for up to\n30\nyears, while others include options to terminate the leases within\n23\nyears.\nA summary of total lease costs and other information for the periods relating to the Company’s finance and operating leases is as follows:\nThe total future minimum lease payments, over the remaining lease term, relating to the Company’s operating and finance leases for each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter is as follows:\nF-32\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOperating lease and finance lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet are as follows:\nThe ROU assets and lease liabilities related to finance leases are included in\nOther assets\nand in\nCurrent debt\nand\nLong-term debt\n, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nAs a result of the continued challenging retail environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of the Company’s freestanding stores experienced lower net sales and lower expectations of future cash flows. These changes were an indicator that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed a recoverability test by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. For those freestanding stores that failed step one of this test, the Company then compared the assets carrying values to their estimated fair values. Specifically, for the related ROU assets, the fair value was based on discounting market rent using a real estate discount rate. As a result, the Company recognized $\n71\nmillion and $\n215\nmillion of long-lived asset impairments, included in Impairments of other intangible and long-lived assets, in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fiscal 2021 impairments related to other assets (i.e. rights associated with commercial operating leases) of $\n27\nmillion, operating lease right-of-use assets of $\n25\nmillion and the related property, plant and equipment in certain freestanding stores of $\n19\nmillion. The fiscal 2020 impairments related to operating lease ROU assets of $\n131\nmillion, as well as the related property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets in certain freestanding stores of $\n84\nmillion, combined.\nA summary of impairment charges is as follows:\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company has additional operating lease obligations, relating primarily to facilities to support the Company’s manufacturing operations, retail stores, and corporate offices, that have not yet commenced of $\n37\nmillion.

As of June 30, 2019, the Company concluded the approvals of all major initiatives under the LBF Program related to the optimization of select corporate functions, supply chain activities, and corporate and regional market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming businesses, and has substantially completed those initiatives through fiscal 2021.\nThe Company estimated a net reduction over the duration of the LBF Program in the range of approximately\n1,300\nto\n1,600\npositions globally, excluding point-of-sale positions. As of June 30, 2021 the net reduction over the duration of the LBF Program was approximately\n1,300\npositions globally, excluding point-of-sale positions.

and technologies and, to a lesser extent, costs for temporary labor backfill, training and recruiting related to new capabilities, as well as similar expenses for certain other corporate functions. These actions resulted in a net reduction of the workforce, which included position eliminations, the re-leveling of certain positions and an investment in new capabilities. The Company also approved other charges to support the LBF Project Management Office (“PMO”), which primarily consisted of internal and external resources that further drove project integration, organizational design capabilities and change management throughout the organization.\nThe design of certain corporate functions included the creation of a shared-services structure, either using Company resources or through external service providers. As part of the service delivery model, the Company approved the organizational design of the management and governance platform of a shared-services structure using Company resources, as well as the transition of select transactional activities to an external service provider, which resulted in other charges for implementation, project and consulting costs.\n•\nOptimize Supply Chain\n–The Company approved certain activities related to initiatives to centralize the Company’s supply chain management, redesign certain supply chain planning and

certain businesses in select markets and channels of distribution. The Company also decided to close a number of underperforming freestanding retail stores and exit mid-tier department stores for certain brands in the United States to redirect resources to other retail locations and channels with potential for greater profitability. These activities resulted in product returns, inventory write-offs, reduction of workforce, accelerated depreciation and termination of contracts.\nAs initiatives under the LBF Program progressed through implementation, the Company identified certain costs that were initially approved but will not be incurred, as well as other changes to the prior estimates. These adjustments are included in their respective period presented above, and were primarily related to estimated employee-related costs for certain employees who either resigned or transferred to other existing positions within the Company.\nLBF Program Restructuring and Other Charges\nRestructuring charges are comprised of the following:\nEmployee-Related Costs\n– Employee-related costs are primarily comprised of severance and other post-employment benefit costs,

to the previous existing useful life will continue to be reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nContract Terminations\n– Costs related to contract terminations include continuing payments to a third party after the Company has ceased benefiting from the rights conveyed in the contract, or a payment made to terminate a contract prior to its expiration. These may include continuing operating lease payments (less estimated sublease payments) to a landlord after exiting a location prior to the lease-end date as a direct result of an approved restructuring initiative. Contract terminations also include minimum payments or fees related to the early termination of license or other personal service contracts. Costs related to contract terminations are expensed upon the cease-use date of a leased property or upon the notification date to the third party in the event of a license or personal service contract termination.\nOther Exit Costs\n– Other exit costs related to restructuring activities generally include costs to relocate facilities or employees, recruiting to fill positions as a result of relocation of operations, and employee outplacement for separated employees. Other exit costs are charged to expense as incurred.\nF-36\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther charges associated

The PCBA Program is designed to help improve efficiency and effectiveness by rebalancing resources to growth areas of prestige beauty. It is expected to further strengthen the Company by building upon the foundational capabilities in which the Company has invested.\nThe PCBA Program’s main areas of focus include accelerating the shift to online with the realignment of the Company’s distribution network reflecting freestanding store and certain department store closures, with a focus on North America and Europe, the Middle East & Africa; the reduction in brick-and-mortar point of sale employees and related support staff; and the redesign of the Company’s regional branded marketing organizations, plus select opportunities in global brands and functions. This program is expected to position the Company to better execute its long-term strategy while strengthening its financial flexibility.\nThe Company previously estimated a net reduction over the duration of the PCBA Program in the range of approximately\n1,500\nto\n2,000\npositions globally, including temporary and part-time employees. The Company has revised these estimates based on the review of the PCBA Program. At this time, the Company estimates a net reduction over the duration of the PCBA Program in the range of\n2,000\nto\n2,500\npositions globally, including temporary and part-time employees. This reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions, retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas. The Company also estimates the closure over the duration of the PCBA Program of approximately\n10\n% to\n15\n% of its freestanding stores globally, primarily in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and in North America.\nThe Company plans to approve specific initiatives under the PCBA Program through fiscal 2022 and expects to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2023.

approximately $\n391\nmillion of net operating loss and other carryforwards with an indefinite carryforward period as of June 30, 2021, these carryforwards expire at various dates through fiscal 2033. Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, in the amount of $\n24\nmillion and $\n14\nmillion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, have been recorded to reflect the tax benefits of the carryforwards not utilized to date.\nF-43\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA full valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nAs of June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $\n62\nmillion, $\n70\nmillion, and $\n67\nmillion, respectively. At June 30, 2021, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $\n53\nmillion.\nThe Company classifies applicable interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The total gross accrued interest and penalty expense recorded during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings was $\n2\nmillion, $\n3\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion, respectively. The total gross accrued interest and penalties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $\n14\nmillion and $\n13\nmillion, respectively.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nEarnings from the Company’s global operations are subject to tax in various jurisdictions both within and outside the United States. The Company participates in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”). The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of income tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations.\nSubsequent to June 30, 2021, the IRS completed its examination procedures with respect to fiscal 2020 under the IRS CAP. There was no impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company expects to receive formal notification of the conclusion of the IRS CAP process for fiscal 2020 during fiscal 2022. As of June 30, 2021, the compliance process was ongoing with respect to fiscal 2021.\nThe Company is currently undergoing income tax examinations and controversies in several state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These matters are in various stages of completion and involve complex multi-jurisdictional issues common among multinational enterprises, including transfer pricing, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company concluded various state, local and foreign income tax audits and examinations while several other matters, including those noted above, were initiated or remained pending. On the basis of the information available in this regard as of June 30, 2021, the Company does not expect significant changes to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.\nF-44\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe tax years subject to examination vary depending on the tax jurisdiction. As of June 30, 2021, the following tax years remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions indicated:\nThe Company is also subject to income tax examinations in numerous other state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company believes that its tax reserves are adequate for all years subject to examination.\nNOTE 10 –\nOTHER ACCRUED AND NONCURRENT LIABILITIES\nOther accrued liabilities consist of the following:\nAt June 30, 2021 and 2020, total Other noncurrent liabilities of $\n2,037\nmillion and $\n1,448\nmillion included $\n849\nmillion and $\n399\nmillion of deferred tax liabilities, respectively.\nF-45\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 11 –\nDEBT\nThe Company’s current and long-term debt

The Company used some of the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund the acquisition of DECIEM, operating expenses, working capital and capital expenditures. In April 2021, the Company repaid $\n450\nmillion aggregate principal amount of its\n1.700\n% Senior Notes due May 10, 2021 in full, partially from the net proceeds of the 2031 Senior Notes issued and cash on hand, and the corresponding interest rate swaps were settled.\nThe Company has a $\n1,500\nmillion commercial paper program under which it may issue commercial paper in the United States. As of June 30, 2021,\nno\namounts were outstanding.\nThe Company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, the average amount outstanding was approximately $\n12\nmillion and $\n12\nmillion, respectively, and the annualized weighted-average interest rate incurred was approximately\n13.0\n% and\n10.3\n%, respectively.\nRefer to\nNote 16 – Commitments and Contingencies\nfor the Company’s projected debt service payments, as of June 30, 2021, over the next five fiscal years.\nF-48\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 12 –\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts, and may enter into option contracts, to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations, which are designated as net investment hedges. The Company enters into the net investment hedges to offset the risk of changes in the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s investment in these foreign operations due to fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Time value is excluded from the effectiveness assessment and is recognized under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The net gain or loss on net investment hedges is recorded within translation adjustments, as a component of AOCI on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, until the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying assets of the Company’s investment. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts, and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At June 30, 2021, the notional amount of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments was $\n3,790\nmillion. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Costs associated with entering into derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company’s consolidated financial results.\nFor each derivative contract entered into, where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively. This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. At inception, the Company evaluates the effectiveness of hedge relationships quantitatively, and has elected to perform, after initial evaluation, qualitative effectiveness assessments of certain hedge relationships to support an ongoing expectation of high effectiveness, if effectiveness testing is required. If based on the qualitative assessment, it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will perform a quantitative assessment to determine whether to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.\nThe fair values of the Company’s derivative financial instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets are presented as follows:\n(1)\nSee\nNote 13 – Fair Value Measurements\nfor further information about how the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities are determined.\nF-49\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe amounts of the gains and losses related to the Company’s derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments that are included in the assessment of effectiveness are as follows:\n(1)\nThe amount reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because probable forecasted transactions will no longer occur by the end of the original time period was not material.\n(2)\nDuring fiscal 2021 and 2020 the gain recognized in earnings from net investment hedges related to the amount excluded from effectiveness testing was $\n19\nmillion and $\n43\nmillion, respectively.\n(3)\nIncluded within translation adjustments as a component of AOCI on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\n(1)\nChanges in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.\nAdditional information regarding the cumulative amount of fair value hedging gain (loss) recognized in earnings for items designated and qualifying as hedged items in fair value hedges is as follows:\nF-50\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAdditional information regarding the effects of fair value and cash flow hedging relationships for derivatives designated and qualifying as hedging instruments is as follows:\nThe amount of the gains and losses related to the Company’s derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments are presented as follows:\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts, and may enter into foreign currency option contracts, to hedge anticipated transactions and receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company’s identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries. The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of March 2023. Hedge effectiveness of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on the forward method, which includes time value in the effectiveness assessment. At June 30, 2021, the Company had cash flow hedges outstanding with a notional amount totaling $\n1,239\nmillion.\nThe Company may enter into interest rate forward contracts to hedge anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the Company’s identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of interest rate movements on the cost of debt issuance.\nF-51\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to sales when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs. If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period sales. As of June 30, 2021, the Company’s foreign currency cash flow hedges were highly effective.\nThe estimated net loss on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as of June 30, 2021 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $\n10\nmillion. The accumulated net gain (loss) on derivative instruments in AOCI was $(\n1\n) million and $\n20\nmillion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness. The Company has interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $\n250\nmillion, $\n700\nmillion and $\n300\nmillion to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its 2022 Senior Notes, 2030 Senior Notes and 2031 Senior Notes, respectively, to variable interest rates based on\nthree-month\nLIBOR plus a margin. These interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt, and the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations. The net gain or loss on these contracts is recorded within translation adjustments, as a component of AOCI on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the Company’s net investment in these foreign operations. The net investment hedge contracts have varying maturities through the end of September 2021. Hedge effectiveness of the net investment hedge contracts is based on the spot method. At June 30, 2021, the Company had net investment hedges outstanding with a notional amount totaling $\n1,476\nmillion.\nCredit Risk\nAs a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least\ntwo\nnationally recognized rating agencies. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $\n67\nmillion at June 30, 2021. To manage this risk, the Company has strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored. Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.\nF-52\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 13 –\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company records certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that require initial measurement or remeasurement at fair value, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations and goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment. The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1:    Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.\nLevel 2:    Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3:    Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument’s valuation.\nThe following table presents the Company’s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2021:\nF-53\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the Company’s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2020:\nThe estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:\nF-54\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the Company’s impairment charges for certain of its nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, classified as Level 3, during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nFiscal 2021\n(1)\nSee\nNote 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nfor discussion of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, the description of the inputs and information used to develop those inputs.\n(2)\nSee\nNote 8 – Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities\nfor further information relating to goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded in connection with the exit of the global distribution of BECCA products.\nF-55\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal 2020\n(1)\nSee\nNote 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nand\nNote 7 – Leases\nfor discussion of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, the description of the inputs and information used to develop those inputs.\nFiscal 2019\n(1)\nSee\nNote 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nfor discussion of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, the description of the inputs and information used to develop those inputs.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:\nCash and cash equivalents –\nCash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, time deposits and money market funds (classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy). Cash deposits in interest bearing accounts and time deposits are carried at cost, which approximates fair value, due to the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.\nF-56\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nForeign currency forward contracts –\nThe fair values of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach. The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to\n12\nmonths, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than\n12\nmonths.\nInterest rate contracts –\nThe fair values of the Company’s interest rate contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach. The significant observable inputs to the model, such as treasury yield curves, swap yield curves and LIBOR forward rates, were obtained from independent pricing services.\nCurrent and long-term debt\n– The fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities. To a lesser extent, debt also includes finance lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value. The Company’s debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\nDECIEM stock options\n– The stock option liability represents the employee stock options issued by DECIEM in replacement and exchange for certain vested and unvested DECIEM employee stock options previously issued by DECIEM, in connection with the Company's acquisition of DECIEM. The DECIEM stock options are subject to the terms and conditions of DECIEM's 2021 Stock Option Plan. The initial fair value of the DECIEM stock option liability was calculated using the acquisition date fair value multiplied by the number of options replaced (consisting of vested and partially vested stock options) on the day following the acquisition date. The acquisition date fair value was calculated using the Monte Carlo Method, which requires certain assumptions. These inputs are categorized as Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  The DECIEM stock options will be remeasured to fair value at each reporting date through settlement, with the offsetting entry to compensation expense, through the period when the options are exercised or repurchased. See\nNote 5 – Acquisition of Businesses and Note 18 – Stock Programs for discussion.\nContingent consideration\n– Contingent consideration obligations consist of potential obligations related to the Company’s acquisitions in previous years. The amounts to be paid under these obligations are contingent upon the achievement of stipulated financial targets by the business subsequent to acquisition. At June 30, 2021, there was no contingent consideration outstanding.\nChanges in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations for the year ended June 30, 2021 are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings and were as follows:\nNOTE 14 –\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nFor further information on the Company's policies relating to revenue recognition see\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nPerformance Obligations\nThe Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product and other promised goods and services to a customer.\nF-57\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company sells wholesale to customers in distribution channels that include department stores, travel retail, specialty-multi retailers, perfumeries, salons/spas and through various online sites operated by authorized retailers. The primary performance obligation related to these channels of distribution is product sales where revenue is recognized as control of the product transfers to the customer. In the Americas region, revenue is generally recognized at the time the product is made available and provided to the customer’s carrier at the Company’s location, and in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, revenue is generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt.\nThe Company also sells direct to consumers at Company-operated freestanding stores and online through Company-owned and operated e-commerce and m-commerce sites and through third-party online malls. At Company-operated freestanding stores, revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred at the point of sale. Revenue from online sales is recognized when control of the product is transferred, generally based upon the consumer’s receipt.\nIn connection with the sale of product, the Company may provide other promised goods and services that are deemed to be performance obligations. These are comprised of customer loyalty program obligations, gift with purchase and purchase with purchase promotions, gift cards and other promotional goods including samples and testers.\nThe Company offers a number of different loyalty programs to its customers across regions, brands and distribution channels including points-based programs, tier-based programs and other programs. Revenue is allocated between the saleable product revenue and the material right loyalty obligations based on relative standalone selling prices when the consumer purchases the products that are earning them the right to the future benefits. Deferred revenue related to the Company’s loyalty programs is estimated based on the standalone selling price and is adjusted for an estimated breakage factor. Standalone selling price is determined primarily using the observable market price of the good or service benefit if it is sold by the Company or a cost plus margin approach for goods/services not directly sold by the Company. Breakage rates consider historical patterns of redemption and/or expiration. Revenue is recognized when the benefits are redeemed or expire.\nThe Company provides gift with purchase promotional products to certain customers generally without additional charge and also provides purchase with purchase promotional products to certain customers at a discount in relation to prices charged for saleable product. Revenue is allocated between saleable product, gift with purchase product and purchase with purchase product based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices. Revenue is deferred and ultimately recognized based on the timing differences, if any, between when control of promotional goods and control of the related saleable products transfer to the Company’s customer (e.g., a third-party retailer), which is calculated based on the weighted-average number of days between promotional periods. The estimated standalone selling price allocated to promotional goods is based on a cost plus margin approach.\nIn situations where promotional products are provided by the Company to its customers at the same time as the related saleable product, such as shipments of samples and testers, the cost of these promotional products are recognized as a cost of sales at the same time as the related revenue is recognized and no deferral of revenue is required.\nThe Company also offers gift cards through Company-operated freestanding stores and Company-owned websites. The related deferred revenue is estimated based on expected breakage that considers historical patterns of redemption taking into consideration escheatment laws as applicable.\nProduct Returns, Sales Incentives and Other Forms of Variable Consideration\nIn measuring revenue and determining the consideration the Company is entitled to as part of a contract with a customer, the Company takes into account the related elements of variable consideration. Such elements of variable consideration include product returns and sales incentives, such as volume rebates and discounts, markdowns, margin adjustments and early-payment discounts. We also enter into arrangements containing other forms of variable consideration, including certain demonstration arrangements, for which the Company does not receive a distinct good or service or for which the Company cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service. For these types of arrangements, the adjustments to revenue are recorded at the later of when (i) the Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of the related goods or services to the customer, or (ii) the Company pays, or promises to pay, the consideration.\nF-58\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the sale of goods with a right of return, the Company only recognizes revenue for the consideration it expects to be entitled to (considering the products to be returned) and records a sales return accrual within Other accrued liabilities for the amount it expects to credit back its customers. In addition, the Company recognizes an asset included in Inventory and promotional merchandise and a corresponding adjustment to Cost of sales for the right to recover goods from customers associated with the estimated returns.\nThe sales return accrual and corresponding asset include estimates that directly impact reported net sales. These estimates are calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels. Consideration of these factors results in an estimate for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations. In addition, as necessary, sales return accruals and the related assets may be established for significant future known or anticipated events. The types of known or anticipated events that are considered, and will continue to be considered, include the financial condition of the Company’s customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and the Company’s decision to continue to support new and existing products.\nThe Company estimates sales incentives and other variable consideration using the most likely amount method and records accruals within Other accrued liabilities when control of the related product is transferred to the customer. Under this method, certain forms of variable consideration are based on expected sell-through results, which requires subjective estimates. These estimates are supported by historical results as well as specific facts and circumstances related to the current period.\nThe Company also enters into transactions and makes payments to certain of its customers related to demonstration, advertising and counter construction, some of which involve cooperative relationships with customers. These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer. To the extent the Company receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration and the fair value of the benefit can be reasonably estimated, the Company’s share of the counter depreciation and the other costs of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.\nAccounts Receivable\nFor further information on the Company's policies relating to accounts receivable see\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nAccounts receivable, net is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions totaling $\n40\nmillion and $\n63\nmillion as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively.  Payment terms are short-term in nature and are generally less than one year.\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are as follows:\nAs a result of the adoption of ASC 326, the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment of approximately $\n3\nmillion, net of tax, as a reduction to its fiscal 2021 opening balance of retained earnings relating to its trade receivables.\nThe remaining balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n20\nmillion, as of June 30, 2021, relates to non-credit losses, which are primarily due to customer deductions.\nF-59\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDeferred Revenue\nChanges in deferred revenue are as follows:\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations\nAt June 30, 2021, the combined estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the next\ntwelve months\nrelated to performance obligations for customer loyalty programs, gift with purchase promotions, purchase with purchase promotions and gift card liabilities that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) is $\n322\nmillion.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the $\n101\nmillion actuarial loss relating to the U.S. pension plans was primarily due to declines in the discount rates relating to the Retirement Growth Account Plan and the Restoration Plan from\n3.8\n% to\n3.0\n% and\n3.4\n% to\n2.5\n%, respectively. The decline in the discount rates as of June 30, 2020 were a result of lower rates on highly rated long-term bonds.\nF-63\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(1)\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at June 30, 2021 were as follows:\na.\nDiscount rate -\n2.94\n% (U.S.),\n1.59\n% (International) and\n2.92\n% (Other than Pension Plans, Post-retirement)\nb.\nRate of compensation increase -\n2.50\n% -\n8.00\n%, graded (U.S.),\n2.81\n% (International) and N/A (Other than Pension Plans, Post-retirement)\n(2)\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the year ended June 30, 2021 were as follows:\na.\nDiscount rate -\n2.93\n% (U.S.),\n1.44\n% (International) and\n2.90\n% (Other than Pension Plans, Post-retirement)\nb.\nExpected return on assets -\n6.25\n% (U.S. and Other than Pension Plans, Post-retirement) and\n2.06\n% (International)\nc.\nRate of compensation increase -\n2.50\n% -\n8.00\n%, graded (U.S.),\n2.72\n% (International) and N/A (Other than Pension Plans, Post-retirement)\nThe discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds. The discount rate for the Company’s Domestic Plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency. The Company used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of the Company’s Domestic Plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan. In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies.\nThe weighted-average interest crediting rate used to determine the benefit oblation and net periodic benefit cost relating to the Company’s U.S. Retirement Growth Account Plan was\n4.02\n% as of and for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nF-64\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. The assumed weighted-average health care cost trend rate for the coming year is\n5.78\n% while the weighted-average ultimate trend rate of\n4.40\n% is expected to be reached in approximately\n19\nyears to\n25\nyears.\nAmounts recognized in AOCI (before tax) as of June 30, 2021 are as follows:\nThe projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the Company’s pension plans at June 30 are as follows:\nInternational pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of the plans’ assets had aggregate projected benefit obligations of $\n369\nmillion and $\n330\nmillion and aggregate fair value of plan assets of $\n223\nmillion and $\n178\nmillion at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. International pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the plans’ assets had aggregate accumulated benefit obligations of $\n127\nmillion and $\n246\nmillion and aggregate fair value of plan assets of $\n5\nmillion and $\n128\nmillion at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nF-65\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe expected cash flows for the Company’s pension and post-retirement plans are as follows:\nPlan Assets\nThe Company’s investment strategy for its pension and post-retirement plan assets is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset classes with the primary goal of meeting long-term cash requirements as they become due. Assets are primarily invested in diversified funds that hold equity or debt securities to maintain the security of the funds while maximizing the returns within each plan’s investment policy. The investment policy for each plan specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for selection of investment managers and procedures to monitor overall investment performance, as well as investment manager performance.\nThe Company’s target asset allocation at June 30, 2021 is as follows:\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for plan assets measured at fair value:\nCash and Cash Equivalents –\nCash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, time deposits and money market funds. These assets are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nShort-term investment funds –\nThe fair values are determined using the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) provided by the administrator of the fund when the Company has the ability to redeem the assets at the measurement date. These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. For some assets the Company is utilizing the NAV as a practical expedient and those investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy.\nGovernment and agency securities –\nThe fair values are determined using third-party pricing services using market prices or prices derived from observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors. These investments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\nF-66\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCommingled funds –\nThe fair values of publicly traded funds are based upon market quotes and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The fair values for non-publicly traded funds are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund when the Company has the ability to redeem the assets at the measurement date. These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. When the Company is utilizing the NAV as a practical expedient those investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy. These investments have monthly redemption frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging from\n10\nto\n30\ndays. There are no unfunded commitments related to these investments.\nInsurance contracts –\nThe fair values are based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios, as well as the consideration of the creditworthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are primarily government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. Insurance contracts are generally classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices or other observable inputs for pricing.\nInterests in limited partnerships and hedge fund investments\n– The fair values are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator as a practical expedient, and therefore these investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy. These investments have monthly and quarterly redemption frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging from\n30\nto\n90\ndays. Unfunded commitments related to these investments are de minimis.\nThe following table presents the fair values of the Company’s pension and post-retirement plan assets by asset category as of June 30, 2021:\nThe following table presents the fair values of the Company’s pension and post-retirement plan assets by asset category as of June 30, 2020:\nF-67\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the changes in Level 3 plan assets:\n401(k) Savings Plan (U.S.)\nThe Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”) is a contributory defined contribution plan covering substantially all regular U.S. employees who have completed the hours and service requirements, as defined by the plan document. Regular full-time employees are eligible to participate in the Savings Plan\nthirty days\nfollowing their date of hire. The Savings Plan is subject to the applicable provisions of ERISA. The Company matches a portion of the participant’s contributions after\none year\nof service under a predetermined formula based on the participant’s contribution level. The Company’s contributions were $\n49\nmillion, $\n37\nmillion and $\n44\nmillion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are not an investment option in the Savings Plan and the Company does not use such shares to match participants’ contributions.\nDeferred Compensation\nThe Company has agreements with certain employees and outside directors who defer compensation. The Company accrues for such compensation, and either interest thereon or for the change in the value of cash units. The amounts included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under these plans were $\n108\nmillion and $\n85\nmillion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The expense for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n31\nmillion, $\n5\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion,

equity compensation plans which include the Amended and Restated Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan (the “Fiscal 2002 Plan”) and the Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Share Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Plans”). These Plans currently provide for the issuance of approximately\n88.8\nmillion shares of Class A Common Stock, which consist of shares originally provided for and shares transferred to the Fiscal 2002 Plan from other inactive plans and employment agreements, to be granted in the form of stock-based awards to key employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company. As of June 30, 2021, approximately\n13.2\nmillion shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved and available to be granted pursuant to these Plans. The Company may satisfy the obligation of its stock-based compensation awards with either new or treasury shares. The Company’s equity compensation awards include stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance share units (“PSUs”), long-term PSUs, including long-term price-vested units (“PVUs”), and share units.\nTotal net stock-based compensation expense is attributable to the granting of and the remaining requisite service periods of stock options, RSUs, PSUs, long-term PSUs and share units. Compensation expense attributable to net stock-based compensation is as follows:\n(1)\nExcludes compensation expense relating to liability-classified awards, including DECIEM stock options discussed below.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards was $\n230\nmillion and the related weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized is approximately\none year\n.\nStock Options\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s stock option programs as of June 30, 2021 and changes during the fiscal year then ended:\n(1)\nThe intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.\nF-71\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe exercise period for all stock options generally may not exceed\nten years\nfrom the date of grant. Stock option grants to individuals generally become exercisable in\nthree\nsubstantively equal tranches over a service period of up to\nfour years\n. The Company attributes the value of option awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards.\nThe following is a summary of the per-share weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted and total intrinsic value of stock options exercised:\nThe fair value of each of the Company's option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:\nThe Company uses a weighted-average expected stock-price volatility assumption that is a combination of both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock. The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources. For the weighted-average expected option life assumption, the Company considers the exercise behavior for past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises. The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rate for the expected term of the options and the average dividend yield is based on historical experience.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company granted RSUs in respect of approximately\n1.0\nmillion shares of Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2021 with a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $\n220.04\nthat, at the time of grant, are scheduled to vest as follows:\n0.3\nmillion in fiscal 2022,\n0.4\nmillion in fiscal 2023 and\n0.3\nmillion in fiscal 2024. Vesting of RSUs granted is generally subject to the continued employment or the retirement of the grantees. The RSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights, payable upon settlement of the RSUs either in cash or shares (based on the terms of the particular award) and, as such, were valued at the closing market price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.\nThe following is a summary of the status of the Company’s RSUs as of June 30, 2021 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:\nF-72\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPerformance Share Units\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company

subject to the achievement of the Company’s net sales and diluted net earnings per common share for the\nthree\nfiscal years ending June 30, 2023, all subject to continued employment or the retirement of the grantees. For PSUs granted, no settlement will occur for results below the applicable minimum threshold. PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the PSUs and, as such, were valued at the closing market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.\nIn September 2020, approximately\n0.2\nmillion shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock were issued, and related accrued dividends were paid, relative to the target goals set at the time of the issuance, in settlement of\n0.5\nmillion PSUs which vested as of June 30, 2020.\nThe following is a summary of the status of the Company’s PSUs as of June 30, 2021 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:\n(1)\nApproximately\n0.2\nmillion PSUs with a performance period ended June 30, 2021 to be issued in September 2021 are included in Nonvested at June 30, 2021.\nLong-term Performance Share Units\nDuring September 2015, the Company granted PSUs to an executive of the Company with an aggregate target payout of\n387,848\nshares (in\nthree\ntranches of approximately\n129,283\neach) of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, generally subject to continued employment through the end of relative performance periods, which end June 30, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Since the Company achieved positive Net Earnings, as defined in the PSU award agreement, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, performance and vesting of each tranche will be based on the Company achieving positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the PSU award agreement, during the relative performance period. Payment with respect to a tranche will be made on the third anniversary of the last day of the respective performance period. The PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash at the same time as the payment of shares of Class A Common Stock. The grant date fair value of these PSUs of $\n30\nmillion was estimated using the closing stock price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as of September 4, 2015, the date of grant. Through June 30, 2021,\n129,283\nshares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock were issued, and the related dividends to be paid, in accordance with the terms of the grant, related to the performance periods ended June 30, 2018.\nDuring January 2016, the Company granted PSUs to an executive of the Company with an aggregate target payout of\n71,694\nshares (in\nthree\ntranches of\n23,898\neach) of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. Since the Company achieved positive Net Earnings, as defined in the PSU award agreement, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the vesting of each tranche will generally be subject to continued employment through the end of relative service periods that end on January 29, 2018, 2019 and 2020. Payment with respect to a tranche will be made within\n30\nbusiness days of the date on which the PSUs vest. The PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash at the same time as the payment of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. The grant date fair value of these PSUs of $\n6\nmillion was estimated using the closing stock price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as of January 28, 2016, the date of grant. In January 2020,\n23,898\nshares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock were issued, and the related dividends were paid, in accordance with the terms of the grant related to the performance period of the award that ended January 29, 2020. Through June 30, 2020,\n71,694\nshares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock were issued, and the related dividends were paid, in accordance with the terms of the grant, related to the performance periods ended January 29, 2018, 2019 and 2020.\nF-73\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn February 2018, the Company granted to an executive of the Company PSUs with an aggregate payout of\n195,940\nshares (in\ntwo\ntranches of\n97,970\nshares each) of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, generally subject to continued employment through the end of the respective performance periods ending June 30, 2021 and 2022. No portion of the award will generally vest unless the Company has achieved positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the performance share unit award agreement, during the relevant performance period. Settlement, if any, with respect to both tranches will be made on September 3, 2024. The PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash at the same time as any payment of shares of Class A Common Stock. The grant date fair value of these PSUs of $\n27\nmillion was estimated using the closing stock price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as of the date of grant.

Generally, no portion of this award will vest unless the Company has achieved positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the price-vested unit award agreement, during the relevant performance period. In addition, the vesting of each tranche is contingent upon the Company’s achievement of the respective stock price goal, which means that the average closing price per share of the Company’s Class A Common Stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange be at or above the applicable stock price goal (noted in the table below) for\n20\nconsecutive trading days during the applicable performance period.\nThe number of shares subject to each tranche of the price-vested unit award, as well as the stock price goals, service periods, performance periods and share delivery dates for each tranche are as follows:\nF-74\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGenerally, delivery of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, if any, will be made on September 2, 2025. The PVUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash at the same time as any delivery of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. The aggregate grant date fair value of the PVUs of approximately $\n20\nmillion was estimated using the Monte Carlo Method, which requires certain assumptions.\nThe significant assumptions used for this award were as follows:\nShare Units\nThe Company grants share units to certain non-employee directors under the Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Share Incentive Plan. The share units are convertible into shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as provided for in that plan. Share units are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that are converted to additional share units when such dividends are declared.\nThe following is a summary of the status of the Company’s share units as of June 30, 2021 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:\nCash Units\nCertain non-employee directors defer cash compensation in the form of cash payout share units, which are not subject to the Plans. These share units are classified as liabilities and, as such, their fair value is adjusted to reflect the current market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. The Company recorded $\n29\nmillion, $\n2\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion as compensation expense to reflect additional deferrals and the change in the market value for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDECIEM Stock Options\nAs a result of the fiscal 2021 acquisition of additional shares of DECIEM, the Company has a stock option plan relating to its majority-owned subsidiary DECIEM (“DECIEM Stock Option Plan”). The DECIEM stock options were issued in replacement of and exchange for certain vested and unvested DECIEM employee stock options previously issued by DECIEM. The DECIEM stock options are subject to the terms and conditions of the DECIEM 2021 Stock Option Plan.  At exchange or replacement date, post-combination vested options totaled\n90,978\noptions and post-combination unvested options totaled\n3,123\noptions of which\n59\nvested as of June 30, 2021.\nThe DECIEM stock options are liability-classified awards as they are expected to be settled in cash and will be remeasured to fair value at each reporting date through date of settlement. Total stock-based compensation expense is attributable to the exchange or replacement of and the remaining requisite service period of stock options. The total stock option expense from the date of acquisition to June 30, 2021 was $\n40\nmillion, with\nno\nrelated income tax benefit.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock awards of the DECIEM Stock Option Plan was $\n4\nmillion and the related weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized is approximately\ntwo years\n.\nF-75\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following is a summary of the DECIEM stock option program as of June 30, 2021 and changes during the fiscal year then ended:\n(1)\nThe intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.\nStock option grants to individuals under the DECIEM Stock Option Plan will vest between\ntwo\nto\nseven\ntranches over a service period of up to\ntwo years\n.  The Company attributes the value of option awards under the DECIEM Stock Option Plan on a graded vesting basis where awards vest at specified rates over a specified period.\nThe following is a summary of the per-share weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted and total intrinsic value of stock options exercised:\nThe initial fair value of the DECIEM stock option liability was calculated using the acquisition date fair value multiplied by the number of options replaced (consisting of vested and partially vested stock options) on the day following the acquisition date. As discussed in\nNote 5 – Acquisition of Businesses,\nDECIEM stock options, with total fair value of $\n294\nmillion, were reported as part of the total consideration transferred. The DECIEM stock options are reported as a stock option liability of $\n141\nmillion in Other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2021.\nThe fair value of the stock options were calculated using the following key assumptions into the Monte Carlo Method:\nF-76\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 19 –\nNET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. PER COMMON SHARE\nNet earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. per common share (“basic EPS”) is computed by dividing Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and shares underlying PSUs and RSUs where the vesting conditions have been met. Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. per common share assuming dilution (“diluted EPS”) is computed by reflecting potential dilution from stock-based awards.\nA reconciliation between the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:\nThe shares of Class A Common Stock underlying stock options, RSUs and PSUs that were excluded in the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive were as follows:\nAs of June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019,\n0.9\nmillion shares,\n1.2\nmillion shares and\n1.3\nmillion shares at target, respectively, of Class A Common Stock underlying PSUs have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on the achievement of certain performance targets of the Company, as discussed in\nNote 18 – Stock Programs\n.\nF-77\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 20 –\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nThe components of AOCI included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consist of the following:\n(1)\nAmounts recorded in Net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.\n(2)\nAmounts recorded in Interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.\n(3)\nAmounts recorded in Provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.\n(4)\nSee\nNote 15 – Pension, Deferred Compensation and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nfor additional information\n.\nF-78\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 21 –\nSTATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nSupplemental cash flow information is as follows:\nNOTE 22 –\nSEGMENT DATA AND RELATED INFORMATION\nReportable operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the “Chief Executive”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for all of the Company’s products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Chief Executive. Although the Company operates in\none\nbusiness segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis. While the Company’s results of operations are also reviewed on a consolidated basis, the Chief Executive reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics. Accordingly, net sales, depreciation and amortization, and operating income are available with respect to the manufacture and distribution of skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and other products. These product categories meet the definition of operating segments and, accordingly, additional financial data are provided below. The “other” segment includes the sales and related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit the definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care. Product category performance is measured based upon net sales before returns associated with restructuring and other activities, and earnings before income taxes, other components of net periodic benefit cost, interest expense, interest income and investment income, net, other income, net and charges associated with restructuring and other activities. Returns and charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to the Company's product categories or geographic regions because they are centrally directed and controlled, are not included in internal measures of product category or geographic region performance and result from activities that are deemed Company-wide initiatives to redesign, resize and reorganize select areas of the business.\nDuring fiscal 2020, changes were made to reflect certain Leading Beauty Forward enhancements made to the capabilities and cost structure of the Company’s travel retail business, which are primarily centralized in The Americas region, and resulted in a change to the royalty structure of the travel retail business to reflect the value created in The Americas region. Accordingly, the fiscal 2019 operating income of The Americas was increased, with a corresponding decrease in Europe, the Middle East & Africa, by $\n866\nmillion to conform with the fiscal 2021 and 2020 methodology and presentation.\nThe accounting policies for the Company’s reportable segments are substantially the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, except for depreciation and amortization charges, which are allocated, primarily, based upon net sales. The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.\nF-79\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nF-80\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(1)\nThe net sales from the Company's travel retail business are included in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa region, with the exception of the net sales of Dr. Jart+ in the travel retail channel that are reflected in Korea in the Asia/Pacific region. Operating income attributable to the travel retail sales included in Europe, the Middle East & Africa is included in that region and in The Americas.\n(2)\nIncludes property, plant and equipment, net. Fiscal 2021 and 2020 also includes operating lease ROU assets, recognized as a result of the adoption of ASC 842. Refer to\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nfor information.\nNet sales are predominantly attributed to a country within a geographic region based on the location of the customer. The Company is domiciled in the United States. Net sales in the United States, including net sales from travel retail locations, in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $\n3,356\nmillion, $\n3,449\nmillion and $\n4,295\nmillion, respectively. Net sales in mainland China, including net sales from travel retail locations, in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were approximately\n36\n%,\n24\n% and\n17\n% of consolidated net sales, respectively, and no other country represented greater than 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales. The Company’s long-lived assets in the United States at June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $\n2,075\nmillion, $\n2,192\nmillion and $\n953\nmillion, respectively.\nF-81\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nSCHEDULE II – VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS\nThree Years Ended June 30, 2021\n(In millions)\n(a)\nFor the year-ended June 30, 2021, “Charged to Other Accounts” includes the impact of the fiscal 2021 adoption of ASC 326 of $\n4\nmillion, pre-tax.\n(b)\nIncludes amounts written-off, net of recoveries.\nS-1\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nINDEX TO EXHIBITS\n____________________\n* Incorporated herein by reference.\n† Exhibit is a management contract or compensatory plan or arrangement."
