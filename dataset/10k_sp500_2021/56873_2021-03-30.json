    "text": "​\nThe Kroger Co. (the “Company” or “Kroger”) was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902.  As of January 30, 2021, we are one of the largest retailers in the world based on annual sales.  We also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our supermarkets.  We maintain a web site (www.thekrogerco.com) that includes the\nKroger Fact Book\nand other additional information about the Company.  Kroger’s website and any reports or other information made available by Kroger through its website are not part of or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We make available through our web site, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form\n8-K and our interactive data files, including amendments.  These forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with, or furnished them electronically to, the SEC.\n​\nOur revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores, fuel centers and via our online platforms. We earn income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs to make these products available to our customers.  Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses.  Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January\n31.  All references to 2020, 2019 and 2018 are to the fiscal years ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively, unless specifically indicated otherwise.\n​\nSTORES\n​\nAs of January 30, 2021, Kroger operated, either directly or through its subsidiaries, 2,742 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names, of which 2,255 had pharmacies and 1,596 had fuel centers.  We offer Pickup (also referred to as ClickList®) and Harris Teeter ExpressLane™— personalized, order online, pick up at the store services — at 2,223 of our supermarkets and provide home delivery service to substantially all of Kroger households. Approximately 51% of our supermarkets were operated in Company-owned facilities, including some Company-owned buildings on leased land.  Our stores operate under a variety of banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition.\nFuel sales are an important part of our revenue, net earnings and loyalty offering.\nOur fuel strategy is to include a fuel center at each of our supermarket locations when it is feasible and it is expected to be profitable.\nEach fuel center typically includes 5 to 10 islands of fuel dispensers and storage tanks with capacity for 40,000 to 50,000 gallons of fuel.\nSupermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats: combination food and drug stores (“combo stores”); multi-department stores; marketplace stores; or price impact warehouses.\n​\nThe combo store is the primary food store format.  They typically draw customers from a 2-2.5 mile radius.  We believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for one-stop shopping, including natural food and organic sections, pharmacies, general merchandise, pet centers and high-quality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce.\n​\nMulti-department stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores.  In addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store, multi-department stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel, home fashion and furnishings, outdoor living, electronics, automotive products and toys.\n​\nMarketplace stores are smaller in size than multi-department stores.  They offer full-service grocery, pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel, home goods and toys.\n​\n3\nPrice impact warehouse stores offer a “no-frills, low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items. Quality meat, dairy, baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage. The average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store.\n​\nSEGMENTS\n​\nWe operate supermarkets and multi-department stores throughout the United States.\nOur retail operations, which represent 97% of our consolidated sales, is our only reportable segment.  We aggregate our operating divisions into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar long-term financial performance.  In addition, our operating divisions offer customers similar products, have similar distribution methods, operate in similar regulatory environments, purchase the majority of the merchandise for retail sale from similar (and in many cases identical) vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location, serve similar types of customers, and are allocated capital from a centralized location.  Our operating divisions are organized primarily on a geographical basis so that the operating division management team can be responsive to local needs of the operating division and can execute company strategic plans and initiatives throughout the locations in their operating division. This geographical separation is the primary differentiation between these retail operating divisions.  The geographical basis of organization reflects how the business is managed and how our Chief Executive Officer, who acts as our chief operating decision maker, assesses performance internally.  All of our operations are domestic.  Revenues, profits and losses and total assets are shown in our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 below.\n​\nMERCHANDISING AND MANUFACTURING\n​\nOur Brands\nproducts play an important role in our merchandising strategy. Our supermarkets, on average, stock over 15,000 private label items.\nOur Brands\nproducts are primarily produced and sold in three “tiers.” Private Selection® is one of our premium quality brands, offering customers culinary foods and ingredients that deliver amazing eating experiences. The Kroger® brand, which represents the majority of our private label items, is designed to consistently satisfy and delight customers with quality products that exceed or meet the national brand in taste and efficacy, as well as with unique and differentiated products. Big K®, Check This Out…® and Heritage Farm® are some of our value brands, designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price.  In addition to our three “tiers,”\nOur Brands\noffers customers a variety of natural and organic products with Simple Truth® and Simple Truth Organic®. Both Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic are free from a defined list of artificial ingredients that customers have told us they do not want in their food, and the Simple Truth Organic products are USDA certified organic.\n​\nApproximately 29% of\nOur Brands\nunits and 40% of the grocery category\nOur Brands\nunits sold in our supermarkets are produced in our food production plants; the remaining\nOur Brands\nitems are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers.  We perform a “make or buy” analysis on\nOur Brands\nproducts and decisions are based upon a comparison of market-based transfer prices versus open market purchases.  As of January 30, 2021, we operated 35 food production plants. These plants consisted of 16 dairies, 9 deli or bakery plants, five grocery product plants, two beverage plants, one meat plant and two cheese plants.\n​\nSEASONALITY\n​\nThe majority of our revenues are generally not seasonal in nature.  However, revenues tend to be higher during the major holidays throughout the year.  Additionally, certain significant events including inclement weather systems, particularly winter storms, tend to affect our sales trends.\n​\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n​\nOur People\n​\nWe want Kroger to be a place our customers love to shop and associates love to work. This is why we create working environments where associates feel encouraged and supported to be their best selves every day.  As of January 30, 2021, Kroger employed approximately 465,000 full- and part-time employees. With these nearly half a million associates serving more than nine million customers every day, our people are essential to our success, and we focus intentionally on attracting, developing and engaging a diverse workforce that represents the communities we serve. We have long been guided by our core values – Honesty, Integrity, Respect, Safety, Diversity and Inclusion.\n4\nAttracting & Developing Our Talent\n​\nWe recognize that our people are our most important asset. To deliver on our customers’ experiences, we continually improve how we attract and retain talent. In addition to competitive wages, quality benefits, and a safe work environment, we offer a broad range of employment opportunities for workers of all ages and aspirations.  During the past decade, Kroger has added 100,000 new jobs in communities across America. Many supermarket roles offer opportunities to learn new skills, grow and advance careers — inside or outside our family of companies.\n​\nAssociates at all levels of the Company have access to training and education programs to build their skills and prepare for the roles they want. In 2021, we expect to spend approximately $125 million on training our associates through onboarding, leadership development programs, and programs designed to upskill associates across the Company. We continue to invest in new platforms and applications to make learning more accessible to our associates.\n​\nBeyond our own programs, associates can take advantage of our tuition reimbursement benefit, which offers up to $3,500 annually — $21,000 over the course of employment — toward continuing education. These funds can be applied to education programs like certifications, associate or graduate degrees. Kroger has invested more than $15 million in this program since it launched in 2018.\n​\nRewarding Our Associates\n​\nWe care about our associates’ overall well-being — physical, financial and emotional — and provide wages and benefits that help associates take care of themselves and their families. Between 2018 and 2020, we invested an incremental $800 million in associate wages.  Since 2018, Kroger’s average retail hourly wage increased to over $15 per hour. Including benefit equivalents, the average rate surpasses $20 per hour.\n​\nPromoting Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n​\nDiversity and inclusion have been among Kroger’s values for decades. We strive to reflect the communities we serve and foster a culture that empowers everyone to be their true self, inspires collaboration, and feeds the human spirit.  During the past year, we have taken a very thoughtful and purposeful approach to enact meaningful change and develop what we believe are the right actions to achieve true and lasting equality. Our new\nFramework for Action: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\nplan reflects our desire to redefine, deepen, and advance our commitment, mobilizing our people, passion, scale and resources.  The following summarizes our framework: Create a More Inclusive Culture; Develop Diverse Talent; Advance Diverse Partnerships; Advance Equitable Communities; Deeply Listen and Report Progress.\n​\nCreating a Safe Environment\n​\nOur associates’ safety is a top priority and it is one of our core values. Since March of 2020, we have made significant investments to reward and safeguard our associates and customers. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we activated our\nPandemic Preparedness Plan\nand\nBusiness Resilience Plan\nto help protect frontline associates, stay open to serve our customers and communities, and anticipate and adapt to critical needs in a rapidly changing situation. Since then, we have enacted more than 30 policy changes to help keep our associates safe, including offering paid emergency leave to those most directly affected by COVID-19, providing personal protective equipment, offering free testing through our COVID-19 at-home test kits, and promoting physical distancing in our locations. We are committed to supporting the health and well-being of our associates by providing a robust range of physical and mental health benefits and offering an incentive to associates who choose to get the COVID-19 vaccine.\n​\nBeyond the pandemic, we prioritize providing the right safety training and equipment, safe working conditions and resources to maintain and improve associates’ well-being. Through our strategy to set clear expectations, routine monitoring, and regular communication and engagement, we reduce the number of injuries and accidents that happen in our workplace.\n​\n5\nWe track health and safety metrics centrally for an enterprise-wide view of issues, trends and opportunities and monitor associate injury performance including total injuries, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) injury rates, and lost-time injuries, as well as customer injury metrics like slip-and-fall injuries. We also track the completion of required training for associates and we regularly share these metrics with leaders and relevant team members to inform management decisions.\n​\nSupporting Labor Relations\n​\nA majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions. There are approximately 350 such agreements, usually with terms of three to five years.  Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance on compensation packages that provide solid wages as well as good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits while also keeping our family of companies competitive in the market.\n​\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n​\nThe following is a list of the names and ages of the executive officers and the positions held by each such person. Except as otherwise noted, each person has held office for at least five years.  Each officer will hold office at the discretion of the Board for the ensuing year until removed or replaced.\n​\n6\n7\n8\n​\nCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT\n​\nFor the disclosure related to our competitive environment, see Item 1A under the heading “Competitive Environment.”\n​"

    "text": "​\nThere are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business.  The significant risk factors are discussed below.  The following information should be read together with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which includes forward-looking statements and factors that could cause us not to realize our goals or meet our expectations.\n​\nCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT\n​\nThe operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and market consolidation. Customer behavior shifted quickly and considerably during the pandemic, including a shift from food away from home to food at home. We see three major trends shaping the industry post-pandemic: e-commerce, cooking at home and prepared foods to go. If we do not appropriately or accurately anticipate customer preferences or fail to quickly adapt to these changing preferences, or if trends shift more quickly to food away from home, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.  If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our customers, our ability to compete and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\n​\n9\nWe are continuing to enhance the customer connection with investments in our four competitive moats – Seamless, Personalization, Fresh, and\nOur Brands\n. Each of these are strategic differentiators and each one is designed to generate customer loyalty and sustainable growth momentum. We believe our plans to deepen and strengthen our competitive moats provide a balanced approach that will enable us to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers.  If we are unable to continue to enhance the foregoing key elements of our connection with customers, or they fail to strengthen customer loyalty, our ability to compete and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.  Our ecosystem monetizes the traffic and data insights generated by our enhanced customer experience. We are using our assets in new ways through these fast-growing, asset-light and margin rich businesses. We may be unsuccessful in implementing our alternative profit strategy, which could adversely affect our market share and business growth, and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  The nature and extent to which our competitors respond to the evolving and competitive industry by developing and implementing their competitive strategies could adversely affect our profitability.\n​\nIn addition, evolving customer preferences and the advancement of online, delivery, ship to home, and mobile channels in our industry enhance the competitive environment. We must anticipate and meet these evolving customer preferences and continue to implement technology, software and processes to be able to conveniently and cost-effectively fulfill customer orders.  Providing flexible fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet customer preferences.  If we are not successful in reducing or offsetting the cost of fulfilling orders outside of our traditional in-store channel with efficiencies, cost-savings, expense reductions, or alternative revenues, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\n​\nIn addition, if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant digital experience for our customers, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted. Digital retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with new developments by our competitors as well as the evolving needs and preferences of our customers. Our digital business accelerated significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic including Pickup, Delivery and Ship. We must compete by offering a convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of how they choose to shop with us, and by investing in, providing and maintaining relevant customer-facing apps and interfaces that have the features customers want that are also reliable and easy to use. The future success of the digital business will also depend on the efficiency and cost effectiveness of fulfilling orders across our modalities, whether in store, in pickup-only locations, and through customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado.\n​\nPRODUCT SAFETY\n​\nCustomers count on Kroger to provide them with safe food and drugs and other merchandise.  Concerns regarding the safety of the products that we sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control.  Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish.  We could be adversely affected by personal injury or project liability claims, product recalls, or other health and safety issues. If we sell products that cause illness or injury to customers, resulting from product contamination or spoilage, the presence of certain substances, or damage caused in handling, storage or transportation, we could be exposed to claims or litigation. Any issue regarding the safety of items whether\nOur Brands\nitems manufactured by the company or for the company or CPG products we sell, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\nEMPLOYEE MATTERS\n​\nA majority of our associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions, and our relationship with those unions, including a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We are a party to approximately 350 collective bargaining agreements.  Upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions.  In addition, changes to national labor policy could affect labor relations with our associates and relationships with unions. Further, if we are unable to control health care, pension and wage costs, or if we have insufficient operational flexibility under our collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\n10\nWe are committed to paying fair wages and providing the benefits that were collectively bargained with the United Food and Commercial Workers (“UFCW”) and other labor unions representing associates. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, wage rates, and healthcare and other insurance costs. Changes to wage regulations, including further increases in the minimum wage and extra pay ordinances enacted by local governments, could have an impact on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling wages and other costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the available qualified workforce in each area where we are located, unemployment levels within those areas, wage rates, and changes in employment and labor laws.\n​\nOur continued success depends on the ongoing contributions of our associates, including members of our senior management and other key personnel. We must recruit, hire, develop and retain qualified associates with an increasingly large range of skills to meet the needs of our evolving and complex business. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these associates and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. Competition among potential employers could result in increased associate costs, or in our failure to recruit and retain associates.  There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain sufficient highly qualified associates in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\nDATA AND TECHNOLOGY\n​\nOur business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations, resulting in an expansion of our technological presence and corresponding risk exposure.  If we were to experience difficulties maintaining or operating existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations.\n​\nThrough our sales and marketing activities, we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us. We also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business. Under certain circumstances, we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business, as required by law, or otherwise in accordance with our privacy policy.\n​\nOur technology systems are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control, and we regularly defend against and respond to data security incidents.  Cyber-attackers have targeted and accessed, and may in the future again attempt to target and access, information stored in our or our vendors’ systems in order to misappropriate confidential customer or business information.  Although we have implemented procedures to protect our information, and require our vendors to do the same, we cannot be certain that our security systems will successfully defend against, or be able to effectively respond to, rapidly evolving, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks as they become more difficult to detect and defend against.  Further, a Kroger associate, a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may in the future circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or may inadvertently cause a breach involving information.  In addition, hardware, software or applications we may use may have inherent defects, vulnerabilities, or could be inadvertently or intentionally applied or used in a way that could compromise our information security.\n​\n11\nOur cybersecurity program, continued investment in our information technology systems, and our processes to evaluate and select vendors with reasonable information security controls may not effectively insulate us from potential attacks, data breaches or disruptions to our business operations, which could result in a loss of customers or business information, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, and exposure to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations, associates and other persons.  Any such events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and may not be covered by our insurance. In addition, compliance with privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes and may require us to devote significant management resources to address these issues.  The costs of attempting to protect against the foregoing risks and the costs of responding to cyber-attacks are significant. Following a cyber-attack, our and/or our vendors’ remediation efforts may not be successful, and a cyber-attack could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers.  In addition, breaches of our and/or our vendors’ security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or confidential information about us or our customers could expose our customers’ private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, and result in investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, loss of customers and business relationships, litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our brands, reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\nData governance failures can adversely affect our reputation and business. Our business depends on our customers’ willingness to entrust us with their personal information. Events that adversely affect that trust, including inadequate disclosure to our customers of our uses of their information, failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers’ sensitive information secure from significant attack, theft, damage, loss or unauthorized disclosure or access, whether as a result of our action or inaction (including human error) or that of our business associates, vendors or other third parties, could adversely affect our brand and reputation and operating results and also could expose and/or has exposed us to mandatory disclosure to the media, litigation (including class action litigation), governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties and/or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive and statutory damages, consent orders, and/or injunctive relief, any of which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Large scale data breaches at other entities, including supply chain security vulnerabilities, increase the challenge we and our vendors face in maintaining the security of our information technology systems and proprietary information and of our customers’ information. There can be no assurance that such failures will not occur, or if any do occur, that we will detect them or that they can be sufficiently remediated.\n​\nThe use of data by our business and our business associates is highly regulated.  Privacy and information-security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to, among other things, systems changes and the development of new processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk or financial losses as a result of non-compliance.\n​\nPAYMENT SYSTEMS\n​\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks, select credit and debit cards, and Kroger Pay, a mobile payment solution.  As we offer new payment options to our customers, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards. It could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us, including due to short term disruption of service. We are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”), which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. If our payment card terminals or internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs and other costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, or if our third-party service providers’ systems are breached or compromised, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\n12\nINDEBTEDNESS\n​\nOur indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, mergers and acquisitions or other purposes and could make us vulnerable to future economic downturns as well as competitive pressures.  If debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness.  Changes in our credit ratings, or in the interest rate environment, could have an adverse effect on our financing costs and structure.\n​\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND INSURANCE\n​\nFrom time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, contract disputes, regulatory claims and other proceedings.  Other legal proceedings purport to be brought as class actions on behalf of similarly situated parties.  Some of these proceedings could result in a substantial loss to Kroger.  We estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities, where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable.  Assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties.  Adverse outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in our evaluations or predictions about the proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Please also refer to the “Litigation” section in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers’ liability, cyber risk exposure and associate health care benefits.  Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. With respect to insured matters, we are liable for retention amounts that vary by the nature of the claim, and some losses may not be covered by insurance. Changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\nMULTI-EMPLOYER PENSION OBLIGATIONS\n​\nAs discussed in more detail below in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies-Multi-Employer Pension Plans,” Kroger contributes to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing associates covered by those agreements.  We believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits, and we expect that Kroger’s contributions to those funds will increase over the next few years.  A significant increase to those funding requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Despite the fact that the pension obligations of these funds are not the liability or responsibility of the Company, except as noted below, there is a risk that the agencies that rate our outstanding debt instruments could view the underfunded nature of these plans unfavorably, or adjust their current views unfavorably, when determining their ratings on our debt securities.  Any downgrading of our debt ratings likely would adversely affect our cost of borrowing and access to capital.\n​\nWe also currently bear the investment risk of two multi-employer pension plans in which we participate.  In addition, we have been designated as the named fiduciary of these funds with sole investment authority of the assets of these funds.  If investment results fail to meet our expectations, we could be required to make additional contributions to fund a portion of or the entire shortfall, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\n13\nINTEGRATION OF NEW BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES\n​\nWe enter into mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances with expected benefits including, among other things, operating efficiencies, procurement savings, innovation, sharing of best practices and increased market share that may allow for future growth.  Achieving the anticipated or desired benefits may be subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including, without limitation, whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, the coordination of geographically separate organizations, the possibility of imprecise assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies, capital requirements, and the integration process, unforeseen expenses and delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace.  We could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues.  Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention.  If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\nFUEL\n​\nWe sell a significant amount of fuel in our 1,596 fuel centers, which could face increased regulation, including due to climate change or other environmental concerns, and demand could be affected by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment as well as retail price increases.  We are unable to predict future regulations, environmental effects, political unrest, acts of terrorism, disruptions to the economy, including but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other matters that may affect the cost and availability of fuel, and how our customers will react to such factors, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS\n​\nOur operating results could be materially impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending.  Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates and other matters could reduce consumer spending.  Increased fuel prices could also have an effect on consumer spending and on our costs of producing and procuring products that we sell.  We are unable to predict how the global economy and financial markets will perform.  If the global economy and financial markets do not perform as we expect, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\nWEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER EVENTS\n​\nA large number of our stores and distribution facilities are geographically located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and earthquakes.  Weather conditions and natural disasters could disrupt our operations at one or more of our facilities, interrupt the delivery of products to our stores, substantially increase the cost of products, including supplies and materials and substantially increase the cost of energy needed to operate our facilities or deliver products to our facilities.  Moreover, the effects of climate change, including those associated with extreme weather events, may affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities that are optimal for us or at all.  Adverse weather, natural disasters, geo-political and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, acts of terrorism or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (which have occurred in the past at our locations), or pandemics, such as the spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, or other future pandemics and other matters that could reduce consumer spending, could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\n14\nCOVID-19\n​\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business. A full year into the pandemic, many factors and uncertainties remain, including:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIn addition, we cannot predict with certainty the extent of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material adverse effect on these parties could materially and adversely impact us.  To the extent that COVID-19 continues to affect the U.S. and global economy and our business, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation and operational risk as a result of regulatory requirements.\n​\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\n​\nOur stores are subject to various laws, regulations, and administrative practices that affect our business. We must comply with numerous provisions regulating, among other things, health and sanitation standards, food labeling and safety, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages, licensing for the sale of food, drugs, and alcoholic beverages, and new provisions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict future laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, or the effect they will have on our operations. They could, however, significantly increase the cost of doing business.  They also could require the reformulation of some of the products that we sell (or manufacture for sale to third parties) to meet new standards.  We also could be required to recall or discontinue the sale of products that cannot be reformulated.  These changes could result in additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or scientific substantiation. Any or all of these requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​\n15\nSUPPLY CHAIN\n​\nDisruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our business. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our business. The loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, acts of war or terrorism, quality control issues, a supplier’s financial distress, natural disasters or health crises, regulatory actions or ethical sourcing issues, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n​"

MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report, as well as Part II, Item 7 “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the year ended February 1, 2020, which provides additional information on comparisons of fiscal years 2019 and 2018.\n​\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY – OUR PATH TO DELIVERING CONSISTENT AND ATTRACTIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN\n​\nWe are proud of our results in 2020 and the balance achieved in delivering for all our key stakeholders – our Associates, Customers, Communities and Investors. We gained market share and exceeded guidance that we gave in the second half of 2020.  We committed more than $2.5 billion to safeguard the environment our associates and customers work and shop in and to reward associates, including a $1 billion commitment to a UFCW pension fund.  Identical sales, without fuel, were 14.1% for 2020, as customers continued to consolidate trips and spend more per transaction. We grew digital sales triple digits in 2020, enabled by our team’s ability to pivot quickly and effectively in the first stage of the pandemic to ensure that we were meeting our customers’ demand for safe, low-touch or touchless shopping modalities. Our strong performance in digital is also a testament to the proactive investments we made over the last several years in our network, which positioned us to respond with agility during this critical time.  We were disciplined in balancing investments in our customers and associates with cost savings. For the third year in a row, our operations and sourcing teams delivered over $1 billion in incremental cost savings. These savings continue to be focused in areas that take complexity out of the business and allow our associates to provide a better customer experience.  Strong execution by our team and accelerated investments in our competitive moats – Fresh,\nOur Brands\n, Data & Personalization and Seamless, during the pandemic allowed us to create significant value for shareholders and strengthen our balance sheet, including accelerated growth in our alternative profit business.  The momentum we see in our business, which started pre-pandemic and accelerated during the pandemic, places us in an even better position to grow sales and profitability in the future and deliver on our total shareholder return commitments.\n​\nOur financial model is underpinned by our leading position in food. We continue to invest in areas of the business that matter most to our customers and deepen our competitive moats, to drive sales growth in our retail supermarket business, including fuel and pharmacy. This in turn generates the data and traffic that enables our fast-growing alternative profit streams. Our financial strategy is to continue to use our free cash flow to invest in the business to drive long-term sustainable net earnings growth, through the identification of high-return projects that support our strategy.  Capital allocation is a core element of our value creation model, and we will allocate capital towards driving profitable sales growth, accelerating digital, expanding margin as well as maintaining the business.  We will continue to be disciplined in deploying capital towards projects that exceed our hurdle rate of return and prioritize the highest return opportunities to drive 3% to 5% net earnings growth.  At the same time, we are committed to maintaining our net debt to adjusted EBITDA range of 2.30 to 2.50 in order to keep our current investment grade debt rating.  Our resilient cash flow will allow us to continue to grow our dividend over time and continue to return excess cash to investors via share repurchases, resulting in consistently strong and sustainable total shareholder return of between 8% and 11%.\n​\n21\nThe following table provides highlights of our financial performance:\n​\nFinancial Performance Data\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\n​\n​\nOVERVIEW\nNotable items for 2020 are:\n​\nShareholder Return\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOther Financial Results\n​\n​\n​\n22\n​\nSignificant Events\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCOVID-19\n​\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that infections of COVID-19 had become a pandemic, and on March 13, the U.S. President announced a National Emergency relating to the disease.  The impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows was material in fiscal year 2020.  We expect the ultimate significance will be dictated by the length of time that such circumstances continue, which will depend on the currently unknowable extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and any governmental and public actions taken in response.\n​\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, our most urgent priority has been to safeguard our associates and customers. We’ve implemented dozens of new safety and cleanliness processes and procedures in our stores and other facilities, including safety partitions and physical distancing floor decals, implementation of customer capacity limits, and providing personal protective equipment like masks for our associates. All of which are described in our\nBlueprint for Businesses\n– an open source guide we created to help other companies navigate the complexities of safely operating during a pandemic.\n​\nAs the pandemic has evolved, we have experienced unusually strong sales.  We continue to see people eat and work more from home and prioritize health and cleanliness.  The change in customer behavior caused by COVID-19 was a major factor in our 2020 results. The pandemic brought to the forefront the importance to the customer of fresh and digital. We continued to invest and grow our capabilities in these areas, leading to gains in both digital and total food at home market share.  Identical sales, without fuel, were 14.1% for 2020, as customers continued to consolidate trips and spend more per transaction. Digital revenue grew 116% in 2020, enabled by our team’s ability to pivot quickly and effectively in the first stage of the pandemic to ensure that we were meeting our customers’ demand for safe, low-touch or touchless shopping modalities.\n​\nOur OG&A expenses include significant incremental costs related to investments in pay and benefits for our associates and measures to safeguard our associates and customers.  Supported by our strong performance and cash position, in 2020 we committed more than $2.5 billion to safeguard the environment our associates and customers work and shop in and to reward associates, including committing nearly $1 billion to better secure pensions for over 30,000 associates. This was in addition to paid emergency leave, financial assistance through our\nHelping Hands\nprogram and more.  As a percentage of sales, these incremental costs were partially offset by sales leverage resulting from strong sales growth due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n​\n23\nOn March 18, 2020, we proactively borrowed $1 billion under the revolving credit facility. This was a precautionary measure in order to preserve financial flexibility, reduce reliance on the commercial paper market and maintain liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Strong execution by our team and accelerated investments in our competitive moats during the pandemic allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet.  During 2020, we fully repaid the $1 billion borrowed under the revolving credit facility and $1.2 billion in outstanding commercial paper obligations, as of year-end 2019, using cash generated by operations.\n​\nFor additional information about our debt activity in 2020, including the drawdown and repayments under our revolving credit facility, forward-starting interest rate swap agreements and our senior note issuances, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  For additional information about our business results, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, see our\nResults of Operations\nand\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nsections within MD&A.\n​\nOUR BUSINESS\n​\nThe Kroger Co. was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902.  As of January 30, 2021, Kroger is one of the world’s largest retailers, as measured by revenue, operating 2,742 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names in 35 states and the District of Columbia.  Of these stores, 2,255 have pharmacies and 1,596 have fuel centers.  We offer Pickup (also referred to as ClickList®) and Harris Teeter ExpressLane™ — personalized, order online, pick up at the store services — at 2,223 of our supermarkets and provide home delivery service to substantially all of Kroger households.  We also operate an online retailer.\n​\nWe operate 35 food production plants, primarily bakeries and dairies, which supply approximately 29% of\nOur Brands\nunits and 40% of the grocery category\nOur Brands\nunits sold in our supermarkets; the remaining\nOur Brands\nitems are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers.\n​\nOur revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores, fuel centers and via our online platforms.  We earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers.  Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses.  Our retail operations, which represent 97% of our consolidated sales, is our only reportable segment.\n​\nOn January 27, 2020, Lucky’s Market filed a voluntary petition in the Bankruptcy Court seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code.  Lucky’s Market is included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in all periods in 2018 and through January 26, 2020.  Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n​\nOn April 26, 2019, we completed the sale of our Turkey Hill Dairy business for total proceeds of $225 million.  Turkey Hill Dairy is included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in all periods in 2018 and through April 25, 2019.\n​\nOn March 13, 2019, we completed the sale of our You Technology business to Inmar for total consideration of $565 million, including $396 million of cash and $64 million of preferred equity received upon closing. We are also entitled to receive other cash payments of $105 million over five years. The transaction includes a long-term service agreement for Inmar to provide us digital coupon services.  You Technology is included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in all periods in 2018 and through March 12, 2019.\n​\nOn June 22, 2018, we closed our merger with Home Chef by purchasing 100% of the ownership interest in Home Chef, for $197 million net of cash and cash equivalents of $30 million, in addition to future earnout payments of up to $500 million over five years that are contingent on achieving certain milestones.  Home Chef is included in our ending Consolidated Balance Sheet for 2019 and 2020 and in our Consolidated Statements of Operations from June 22, 2018 through February 2, 2019 and all periods in 2019 and 2020.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our merger with Home Chef.\n​\nOn April 20, 2018, we completed the sale of our convenience store business unit for $2.2 billion.  The convenience store business is included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations through April 19, 2018.\n​\n24\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes, are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We provide non-GAAP measures, including First-In, First-Out (“FIFO”) gross margin, FIFO operating profit, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share because management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin, operating profit, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other GAAP measure of performance. These measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n​\nWe calculate FIFO gross margin as FIFO gross profit divided by sales. FIFO gross profit is calculated as sales less merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing, and transportation expenses, but excluding the Last-In, First-Out (“LIFO”) charge. Merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses. FIFO gross margin is an important measure used by management as management believes FIFO gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our day-to-day merchandising and operational effectiveness.\n​\nWe calculate FIFO operating profit as operating profit excluding the LIFO charge. FIFO operating profit is an important measure used by management as management believes FIFO operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our day-to-day operational effectiveness.\nThe adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share metrics are important measures used by management to compare the performance of core operating results between periods. We believe adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons for our net earnings and net earnings per diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations.  Net earnings for 2020 include the following, which we define as the “2020 Adjusted Items:”\n​\n​\n​\nNet earnings for 2019 include the following, which we define as the “2019 Adjusted Items:”\n​\n​\n​\nNet earnings for 2018 include the following, which we define as the “2018 Adjusted Items:”\n​\n25\n​\n​\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. to adjusted net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. and a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share to adjusted net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share, excluding the 2020, 2019 and 2018 Adjusted Items.\n​\n26\nNet Earnings per Diluted Share excluding the Adjusted Items\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\n​\n​\n27\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n​\nSales\n​\nTotal Sales\n($ in millions)\n​\nTotal sales increased in 2020, compared to 2019, by 8.4%.  The increase was due to an increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel, partially offset by a reduction in supermarket fuel sales and decreased sales due to the disposal of Turkey Hill Dairy and You Technology in the first quarter of 2019. Total sales to retail customers without fuel increased 13.6% in 2020, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to our identical sales increase, excluding fuel, of 14.1%, partially offset by decreased sales due to the deconsolidation of Lucky’s Market in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Total sales excluding fuel and dispositions increased 14.2% in 2020 compared to 2019.  The significant increase in identical sales, excluding fuel, was caused by unprecedented demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, digital sales growth and growth in market share. Market share growth contributed to our identical sales increase, excluding fuel, as our sales outpaced the general growth in the food retail industry during 2020.  The increase in identical sales, excluding fuel, was broad based across all supermarket divisions and remained heightened throughout 2020.  During the pandemic, customers reduced trips while significantly increasing basket value.\n​\nTotal supermarket fuel sales decreased 32.5% in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in fuel gallons sold of 17.5% and a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 18.2%. The decrease in fuel gallons sold was reflective of the national trend, which decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel.\n​\nTotal sales increased in 2019, compared to 2018, by 0.4%.  The increase was due to an increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel, partially offset by decreased supermarket fuel sales, a reduction in convenience store sales due to the sale of our convenience store business unit in the first quarter of 2018 and decreased sales due to the disposal of Turkey Hill Dairy and You Technology in the first quarter of 2019.  Total sales, excluding fuel, dispositions and the merger with Home Chef increased 2.3% in 2019, compared to 2018.  The increase in total sales to retail customers without fuel for 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to our merger with Home Chef and our identical sales increase, excluding fuel, of 2.0%.  Identical sales, excluding fuel, for 2019, compared to 2018, increased primarily due to growth of loyal households, a higher customer basket value including retail inflation and Kroger Specialty Pharmacy sales growth, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers.\n​\nTotal supermarket fuel sales decreased 5.7% in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in fuel gallons sold of 4.8% and a decrease in the average retail fuel price of 1.0%. The decrease in the average retail fuel price was caused by a decrease in the product cost of fuel.\n​\n28\nWe calculate identical sales, excluding fuel, as sales to retail customers, including sales from all departments at identical supermarket locations, Kroger Specialty Pharmacy businesses and ship-to-home solutions. We define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters. Although identical sales is a relatively standard term, numerous methods exist for calculating identical sales growth. As a result, the method used by our management to calculate identical sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical sales. We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical sales before comparing our identical sales to those of other such companies. Our identical sales, excluding fuel, results are summarized in the following table. We used the identical sales, excluding fuel, dollar figures presented below to calculate percentage changes for 2020 and 2019.\n​\nIdentical Sales\n($ in millions)\n​\n​\nGross Margin, LIFO and FIFO Gross Margin\n​\nWe define gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing, and transportation. Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in gross margin.\n​\nOur gross margin rates, as a percentage of sales, were 23.32% in 2020 and 22.07% in 2019.  The increase in 2020, compared to 2019, resulted primarily from decreased fuel sales, which have a lower gross margin rate, an increase in our fuel gross margin, growth in our alternative profit stream portfolio, effective negotiations to achieve savings on the cost of products sold and decreased shrink, transportation and advertising costs, as a percentage of sales, reflecting the significant increase in sales volumes, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and a change in our product sales mix, including lower relative sales in higher gross margin categories such as deli/bakery.\n​\nOur LIFO credit was $7 million in 2020 compared to a LIFO charge of $105 million in 2019.  Our LIFO credit was primarily driven by fourth quarter 2020 working capital improvements in pharmacy inventory and dairy deflation.\n​\nOur FIFO gross margin rate, which excludes the LIFO charge, was 23.32% in 2020, compared to 22.16% in 2019.  Our fuel sales lower our FIFO gross margin rate due to the very low FIFO gross margin rate, as a percentage of sales, of fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales.  Excluding the effect of fuel, our FIFO gross margin rate increased 14 basis points in 2020, compared to 2019. This increase resulted primarily from growth in our alternative profit stream portfolio, effective negotiations to achieve savings on the cost of products sold and decreased shrink, transportation and advertising costs, as a percentage of sales, reflecting the significant increase in sales volumes, partially offset by continued investments in lower prices for our customers and a change in our product sales mix, including lower relative sales in higher gross margin categories such as deli/bakery.\n​\nOperating, General and Administrative Expenses\n​\nOG&A expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs such as wages, healthcare benefit costs, retirement plan costs, utilities, and credit card fees. Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in OG&A.\n​\nOG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 18.49% in 2020 and 17.34% in 2019.  The increase in 2020, compared to 2019, resulted primarily from the First Quarter 2020 Multi-Employer Pension Contribution, the 2020 OG&A Adjusted Items, the COVID-19 Investments, growth in our digital channel as a result of heightened demand during the pandemic, increased incentive plan costs and the effect of decreased fuel sales, which increases our OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by the effect of increased sales due to the pandemic which decreases our OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, the 2019 OG&A Adjusted Items and broad based improvement from cost savings initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies, store productivity and sourcing cost reductions.\n​\n29\nOur fuel sales lower our OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, due to the very low OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales, of fuel sales compared to non-fuel sales.  Excluding the effect of fuel, the 2020 OG&A Adjusted Items and the 2019 OG&A Adjusted Items, our OG&A rate decreased 6 basis points in 2020, compared to 2019. This decrease resulted primarily from the effect of increased sales due to the pandemic which decreases our OG&A rate, as a percentage of sales and broad based improvement from cost savings initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies, store productivity and sourcing cost reductions, partially offset by the First Quarter 2020 Multi-Employer Pension Contribution, the COVID-19 Investments, growth in our digital channel as a result of heightened demand during the pandemic and increased incentive plan costs.  Excluding the $236 million First Quarter 2020 Multi-Employer Pension Contribution from the above calculation, which we proactively made to cover future funding requirements for certain multi-employer pension plans, our OG&A rate improved 25 basis points.\n​\nRent Expense\n​\nRent expense was $874 million, or 0.66% of sales, for 2020, compared to $884 million, or 0.72% of sales, for 2019.  Rent expense, as a percentage of sales, decreased 6 basis points in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the effect of increased sales due to the pandemic which decreases our rent expense, as a percentage of sales.\n​\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\n​\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $2.7 billion, or 2.07% of sales, for 2020, compared to $2.6 billion, or 2.17% of sales, for 2019.  Depreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of sales, decreased 10 basis points in 2020, compared to 2019.  This decrease resulted primarily from the effect of increased sales due to the pandemic which decreases our depreciation expense, as a percentage of sales, partially offset by decreased fuel sales, which increases our depreciation expense, as a percentage of sales, additional depreciation on capital investments, excluding mergers and lease buyouts, of $3.2 billion during 2020 and a decrease in the average useful life on these capital investments. Our strategy includes initiatives to enhance the customer experience in stores, improve our process efficiency and integrate our digital shopping experience through technology developments. As such, the percentage of capital investments related to digital and technology has grown compared to the prior year, which has caused a decrease in the average depreciable life of our capital portfolio.\n​\nOperating Profit and FIFO Operating Profit\n​\nOperating profit was $2.8 billion, or 2.10% of sales, for 2020, compared to $2.3 billion, or 1.84% of sales, for 2019.  Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, increased 26 basis points in 2020, compared to 2019, due to improved sales to retail customers without fuel, a higher gross margin rate, decreased rent and depreciation and amortization expenses, as a percentage of sales, and increased fuel earnings, partially offset by increased OG&A expense with fuel, as a percentage of sales.\n​\nFIFO operating profit was $2.8 billion, or 2.09% of sales, for 2020, compared to $2.4 billion, or 1.93% of sales, for 2019.  FIFO operating profit, excluding the 2020 and 2019 Adjusted Items, increased 64 basis points in 2020, compared to 2019, due to improved sales to retail customers without fuel, a higher gross margin rate, decreased rent and depreciation and amortization expenses, as a percentage of sales, and increased fuel earnings, partially offset by increased OG&A expense with fuel, as a percentage of sales.\n​\nSpecific factors contributing to the trends driving operating profit and FIFO operating profit identified above are discussed earlier in this section.\n​\n30\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of operating profit to FIFO operating profit, excluding the 2020 and 2019 Adjusted Items.\n​\nOperating Profit excluding the Adjusted Items\n($ in millions)\n​\n​\nInterest Expense\n​\nInterest expense totaled $544 million in 2020 and $603 million in 2019.  The decrease in interest expense in 2020, compared to 2019, resulted primarily from decreased borrowings.  Over the last 12 months, we decreased total debt, including obligations under finance leases, by $663 million.\n​\nIncome Taxes\n​\nOur effective income tax rate was 23.2% in 2020 and 23.7% in 2019.  The 2020 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes, partially offset by the utilization of tax credits and deductions.  The 2019 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes and Lucky’s Market losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest which reduced pre-tax income but did not impact tax expense.\n​\nNet Earnings and Net Earnings Per Diluted Share\n​\nOur net earnings are based on the factors discussed in the Results of Operations section.\n​\nNet earnings were $3.27 per diluted share for 2020 compared to net earnings of $2.04 per diluted share for 2019.  Adjusted net earnings of $3.47 per diluted share for 2020 represented an increase of 58.4% compared to adjusted net earnings of $2.19 per diluted share for 2019.  The increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share resulted primarily from increased FIFO operating profit without fuel, the decrease in the LIFO charge, increased fuel earnings and lower weighted average common shares outstanding due to common share repurchases, partially offset by a higher income tax expense.\n​\n31\nCOMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS\n​\nWe maintain share repurchase programs that comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares, from time to time.  The share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by our Board of Directors at any time.  We made open market purchases of our common shares totaling $1.2 billion in 2020 and $400 million in 2019.\n​\nIn addition to these repurchase programs, we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans.  This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, and the tax benefit from these exercises.  We repurchased approximately $128 million in 2020 and $65 million in 2019 of our common shares under the stock option program.\n​\nOn November 5, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trades intending to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “November 2019 Repurchase Program”).  On September 11, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program to reacquire shares via open market purchase or privately negotiated transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trades intending to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “September 2020 Repurchase Program”). The September 2020 Repurchase Program authorization replaced the existing November 2019 Repurchase Program.\n​\nThe shares repurchased in 2020 were reacquired under the following share repurchase programs:\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAs of January 30, 2021, there was $400 million remaining under the September 2020 Repurchase Program.\n​\nDuring the first quarter through March 24, 2021, we repurchased an additional $36 million of our common shares under the stock option program and $191 million additional shares under the September 2020 Repurchase Program.  As of March 24, 2021, we have $209 million remaining under the September 2020 Repurchase Program.\n​\nCAPITAL INVESTMENTS\n​\nCapital investments, including changes in construction-in-progress payables and excluding mergers and the purchase of leased facilities, totaled $3.2 billion in 2020 and $3.0 billion in 2019.  Capital investments for the purchase of leased facilities totaled $58 million in 2020 and $82 million in 2019.  The table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total supermarket square footage:\n​\n32\nSupermarket Storing Activity\n​\n​\nRETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL\n​\nWe calculate return on invested capital (“ROIC”) by dividing adjusted ROIC operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital.  Adjusted operating profit for ROIC purposes is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit, and adding back our LIFO charge (credit), depreciation and amortization and rent to our U.S. GAAP operating profit of the prior four quarters.  Average invested capital is calculated as the sum of (i) the average of our total assets, (ii) the average LIFO reserve, (iii) the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and (iv) for 2019, an adjustment due to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, “Leases,” at the beginning of 2019 as further described in Notes 10 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; minus (i) the average taxes receivable, (ii) the average trade accounts payable, (iii) the average accrued salaries and wages, (iv) the average other current liabilities, excluding accrued income taxes, (v) the average liabilities held for sale and (vi) certain other adjustments.  Averages are calculated for ROIC by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter, of the last four quarters, and dividing by two.  ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance.  ROIC should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP.  ROIC is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital.  Management believes ROIC is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets.\n​\nAlthough ROIC is a relatively standard financial term, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROIC.  As a result, the method used by our management to calculate ROIC may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.  We urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROIC before comparing our ROIC to that of such other companies.\n​\n33\nThe following table provides a calculation of ROIC for 2020 and 2019 on a 52 week basis ($ in millions).  The 2019 calculation of ROIC excludes the financial position and results of operations of You Technology and Turkey Hill Dairy, due to the sales in 2019, and Lucky’s Market, due to the deconsolidation in 2019.\n​\n(1)\nTaxes receivable were $66 as of January 30, 2021 and $82 as of February 1, 2020.  We did not have any taxes receivable as of February 2, 2019.\n(2)\nOther current liabilities included accrued income taxes of $9 as of January 30, 2021 and $60 as of February 2, 2019.  We did not have any accrued income taxes as of February 1, 2020. Accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital.\n​\n34\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n​\nWe have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner.  Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n​\nWe believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\n​\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets\n​\nWe monitor the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred.  These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset.  When a triggering event occurs, we perform an impairment calculation, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores.  If we identify impairment for long-lived assets to be held and used, we compare the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value.  Fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows.  We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value.  With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions.  We recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal.\n​\nWe recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling $70 million in 2020.  In 2019, we recognized an impairment charge related to Lucky’s Market totaling $238 million.  The Lucky’s Market impairment charge consisted of property, plant and equipment of $200 million; goodwill of $19 million; operating lease assets of $11 million; and other charges of $8 million.  Additionally, we recorded asset impairments totaling $120 million in 2019, including $70 million of operating lease assets.  This 2019 impairment charge included the 35 planned store closures across our footprint in 2020 related to our transformation efforts.  We record costs to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as OG&A expense.\n​\nThe factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows.  Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition.  Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long-lived assets for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results.\n​\nBusiness Combinations\n​\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting.  All the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition once we obtain control of an entity. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities involves estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.  We use various techniques to determine fair value in such instances, including the income approach.  Significant estimates used in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.  See Note 3 for further information about goodwill.\n​\n35\nGoodwill\n​\nOur goodwill totaled $3.1 billion as of January 30, 2021.  We review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of triggering events.  We perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and other consolidated entities (collectively, “reporting units”) that have goodwill balances.  Generally, fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment.  We base projected future cash flows on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future.  We recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of a reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n​\nOur annual evaluation of goodwill is performed for our reporting units during the fourth quarter.  The 2020 fair value of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy reporting unit was estimated using multiple valuation techniques: a discounted cash flow model (income approach), a market multiple model and a comparable mergers and acquisition model (market approaches), with each method weighted in the calculation. The income approach relies on management’s projected future cash flows, estimates of revenue growth rates, margin assumptions and an appropriate discount rate. The market approaches require the determination of an appropriate peer group, which is utilized to derive estimated fair values based on selected market multiples.  The annual evaluation of goodwill performed in 2020, 2019 and 2018 did not result in impairment for any of our reporting units.  Based on current and future expected cash flows, we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely.  A 10% reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance.\n​\nFor additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2020, 2019 and 2018, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\nThe impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates.  Application of alternative estimates and assumptions could produce significantly different results.  The cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation, business valuations in the market, the economy, market competition and our ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses.\n​\nMulti-Employer Pension Plans\n​\nWe contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements.  These multi-employer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers.  The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose.  Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions.  The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans.\n​\nWe recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable, in accordance with GAAP.  We made cash contributions to these plans of $619 million in 2020, $461 million in 2019 and $358 million in 2018.  The increase in 2020, compared to 2019 and 2018 is due to the First Quarter 2020 Multi-Employer Pension Contribution.\n​\nWe continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans as it relates to our associates who are beneficiaries of these plans.  These under-fundings are not our liability.  When an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to us and our associates, we may negotiate the restructuring of under-funded multi-employer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multi-employer pension plan.  The commitments from these restructurings do not change our debt profile as it relates to our credit rating since these off-balance sheet commitments are typically considered in our investment grade debt rating.  We are currently designated as the named fiduciary of the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“IBT”) Consolidated Pension Fund and have sole investment authority over these assets.  Significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements are:\n​\n​\n36\n​\n​\nAs we continue to work to find solutions to under-funded multi-employer pension plans, it is possible we could incur withdrawal liabilities for certain funds.\n​\nBased on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits.  We have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, (i.e., the amount of underfunding), as of December 31, 2020.  Because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our “share” of the underfunding.  Nonetheless, the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2020, we estimate our share of the underfunding of multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute was approximately $1.7 billion, $1.3 billion net of tax.  This represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately $600 million, $500 million net of tax, as of December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019.\nThe decrease in the amount of underfunding is primarily attributable to higher expected returns on assets in the funds during 2020, restructuring of the National Fund and the First Quarter 2020 Multi-Employer Pension Contribution.  Our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data (that include the estimates of others), and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable.\n​\nWe have made and disclosed this estimate not because, except as noted above, this underfunding is a direct liability of ours.  Rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences.  In the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with GAAP.\n​\nThe amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations, returns on the assets held in the multi-employer pension plans, benefit payments or future restructuring agreements.  The amount could decline, and our future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation.  On the other hand, our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline, if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation.  We continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans.  Although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours, any commitments to fund certain multi-employer pension plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made.\n​\nSee Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information relating to our participation in these multi-employer pension plans.\n​\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n​\nRefer to Note 18 and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted as of January 30, 2021.\n​\n37\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n​\nCash Flow Information\n​\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n​\nWe generated $6.8 billion of cash from operations in 2020 compared to $4.7 billion in 2019.  Net earnings including noncontrolling interests, adjusted for non-cash items and other impacts, generated approximately $5.3 billion of operating cash flow in 2020 compared to $5.0 billion in 2019.  Cash provided (used) by operating activities for changes in operating assets and liabilities, including working capital, net of effects from mergers and disposals of businesses was $1.5 billion in 2020 compared to ($312) million in 2019. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for changes in operating assets and liabilities, including working capital, net of effects from mergers and disposals of businesses, was primarily due to the following:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCash paid for taxes decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the payment of taxes on the gain on sale of the You Technology and Turkey Hill Dairy businesses in 2019.\n​\nCash paid for interest increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the timing of certain semi-annual senior note interest payments that were paid during the first quarter of 2020 which were accrued as of the end of fiscal year 2019.\n​\nNet cash used by investing activities\n​\nInvesting activities used cash of $2.8 billion in 2020 compared to $2.6 billion in 2019. The amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the following:\n​\n​\n​\n38\nNet cash used by financing activities\n​\nWe used $2.7 billion of cash for financing activities in 2020 compared to $2.1 billion during 2019.  The amount of cash used for financing activities for 2020, compared to 2019, increased primarily due to increased payments on commercial paper and share repurchases, partially offset by increased proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and decreased payments on long-term debt.\n​\nDebt Management\n​\nTotal debt, including both the current and long-term portions of obligations under finance leases, decreased $663 million to $13.4 billion as of year-end 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in 2020, compared to 2019, resulted primarily from net payments on commercial paper borrowings of $1.2 billion and payment of $700 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3.30%, partially offset by the issuance of $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 2.20%, the issuance of $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 1.70% and a net increase in obligations under finance leases of $183 million.\n​\nDividends\n​\nThe following table provides dividend information ($ in millions, except per share amounts):\n​\n​\nLiquidity Needs\n​\nBased on current operating trends, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility, will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months. Our liquidity needs include anticipated requirements for working capital, capital investments, pension plan commitments, interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper, offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of 2020. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets.  We have approximately $800 million of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months, $311 million of the employer portion of social security tax payments we have deferred under the CARES act that is required to be paid by December 31, 2021 and expect to pay approximately $307 million in the first half of 2021 to satisfy a portion of the National Fund commitment. We expect to satisfy these obligations using cash generated from operations, temporary cash investments on hand, or through the issuance of additional senior notes or commercial paper.  We believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current investment grade debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions.\n​\nWe held cash and temporary cash investments of $1.7 billion as of the end of 2020 which reflects our elevated operating performance and significant improvements in working capital.  We remain committed to our dividend and share repurchase program and we will evaluate the optimal use of any excess free cash flow, consistent with our previously stated capital allocation strategy.\n​\nThe CARES Act, which was enacted on March 27, 2020, includes measures to assist companies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures include deferring the due dates of tax payments and other changes to income and non-income-based tax laws. As permitted under the CARES Act, we are deferring the remittance of the employer portion of the social security tax. The social security tax provision requires that the deferred employment tax be paid over two years, with half of the amount required to be paid by December 31, 2021 and the other half by December 31, 2022.  During 2020, we deferred the employer portion of social security tax of $622 million.  Of the total, $311 million is included in “Other current liabilities” and $311 million is included in “Other long-term liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\nFor additional information about our debt activity in 2020, including the drawdown and repayments under our revolving credit facility, forward-starting interest rate swap agreements and our senior notes issuances, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n39\nFactors Affecting Liquidity\n​\nWe can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $2.75 billion under our commercial paper program.  At January 30, 2021, we had no outstanding commercial paper.  Commercial paper borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility.  If our short-term credit ratings fall, the ability to borrow under our current commercial paper program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our commercial paper program.  This could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity.  However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program would be any lower than $500 million on a daily basis.  Although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost and applicable margin on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a downgrade in our Public Debt Rating.  “Public Debt Rating” means, as of any date, the rating that has been most recently announced by either S&P or Moody’s, as the case may be, for any class of non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt issued by the Company.  As of March 24, 2021, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\n​\nOur credit facility requires the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (our “financial covenants”).  A failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility. These financial covenants are described below:\n​\n​\n​\nOur credit facility is more fully described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We were in compliance with our financial covenants at year-end 2020.\n​\n40\nThe tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments, based on year of maturity or settlement, as of January 30, 2021 (in millions of dollars):\n​\n​\nAs of January 30, 2021, we maintained a $2.75 billion (with the ability to increase by $1 billion), unsecured revolving credit facility that, unless extended, terminates on August 29, 2022. Outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, commercial paper borrowings, and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facility.  As of January 30, 2021, we had no outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  The outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit facility totaled $2 million as of January 30, 2021.\n​\nIn addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of January 30, 2021, we had authorized for issuance $3.3 billion of securities remaining under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and effective on May 24, 2019.\n​\n41\nWe also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self-insured workers’ compensation claims.  These bonds are required by most states in which we are self-insured for workers’ compensation and are placed with predominately third-party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self-insured retention levels.  These bonds do not represent liabilities of ours, as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs.  Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of, or access to, such bonds.  Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we would issue letters of credit, in states where allowed, against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements.  This could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility.\n​\nWe also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions.  We could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations.  Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote.  We have agreed to indemnify certain third-party logistics operators for certain expenses, including multi-employer pension plan obligations and withdrawal liabilities.\n​\nIn addition to the above, we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business.  Such arrangements include indemnities against third-party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us; indemnities related to the sale of our securities; indemnities of directors, officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work; and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans.  While our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability.\n​\n42"

    "text": "​\nFinancial Risk Management\n​\nWe manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program, variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps.  Our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates.  To do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total amount that represents 25% of the carrying value of our debt portfolio or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status.\n​\nWhen we use derivative financial instruments, it is primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.  We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure.  Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure.  The interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets.  As of January 30, 2021, we had no forward-starting interest rate swap agreements outstanding.\n​\nAnnually, we review with the Financial Policy Committee of our Board of Directors compliance with the guidelines described above.  The guidelines may change as our business needs dictate.\n​\nThe tables below provide information about our underlying debt portfolio as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020.  The amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding finance leases, as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020.  Interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments.  The variable rate debt is based on U.S. dollar LIBOR using the forward yield curve as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020.  The Fair Value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020.  We have no outstanding interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of January 30, 2021 or February 1, 2020.  See Notes 6, 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\n​\n​\nBased on our year-end 2020 variable rate debt levels, a 10 percent change in interest rates would be immaterial.  See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies.\n​\n43"

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2021 based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nChanges in Accounting Principles\n​\nAs discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2018.\nBasis for Opinions\n​\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n​\n45\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n​\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\n​\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n​\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment – Kroger Specialty Pharmacy (“KSP”) Reporting Unit\n​\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $3.1 billion as of January 30, 2021, a portion of which is allocated to the KSP reporting unit. Management reviews goodwill annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of triggering events.  The fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value for purposes of identifying potential impairment. Goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. As disclosed by management, the fair value of the Company's KSP reporting unit was estimated using multiple valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach), a market multiple model and comparable mergers and acquisition model (market approaches), with each method weighted in the calculation. The income approach relies on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates, margin assumptions, and discount rate to estimate future cash flows. The market approaches require the determination of an appropriate peer group, which is utilized to derive estimated fair values based on selected market multiples.\n​\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the KSP reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting unit; (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s cash flow projections and significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, margin assumptions, discount rate, peer group determination, and market multiple selection; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n​\n46\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s KSP reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate, evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market approach models, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the models and evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to the revenue growth rates, margin assumptions, discount rate, peer group determination, and market multiple selection. Evaluating management’s assumptions relating to revenue growth rates and margin assumptions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating the Company’s peer group determinations included evaluating the appropriateness of the identified peer companies. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow and market models and evaluating the reasonableness of certain significant assumptions related to the discount rate, peer group determination, and market multiples.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nCincinnati, Ohio\nMarch 30, 2021\n​\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1929.\n​\n47\nTHE KROGER CO.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n​\n​\n​\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n​\n48\nTHE KROGER CO.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n​\nYears Ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019\n​\n​\n​\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n​\n49\nTHE KROGER CO.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n​\nYears Ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019\n​\n​\n​\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n​\n50\nTHE KROGER CO.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n​\nYears Ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019\n​\n​\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements\n​\n​\n51\n​\nTHE KROGER CO.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n​\nYears Ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019\n​\n​\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n​\n​\n52\n​\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n​\nAll amounts in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are in millions except per share amounts.\n​\n​\nThe following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparing these financial statements.\n​\nDescription of Business, Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n​\nThe Kroger Co. (the “Company”) was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902.  As of January 30, 2021, the Company was one of the largest retailers in the world based on annual sales.  The Company also manufactures and processes food for sale by its supermarkets.  The accompanying financial statements include the consolidated accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and other consolidated entities.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n​\nRefer to Note 18 for a description of changes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting standards regarding the recognition of lease agreements, reclassification of stranded tax effects and implementation costs of cloud computing arrangements.\n​\nFiscal Year\n​\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31.  The last three fiscal years consist of the\n52\n-week periods ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019.\n​\nPervasiveness of Estimates\n​\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.  Disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of consolidated revenues and expenses during the reporting period is also required.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n​\nCash, Temporary Cash Investments and Book Overdrafts\n​\nCash and temporary cash investments represent store cash and short-term investments with original maturities of less than three months.  Book overdrafts are included in “Trade accounts payable” and “Accrued salaries and wages” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\nDeposits In-Transit\n​\nDeposits in-transit generally represent funds deposited to the Company’s bank accounts at the end of the year related to sales, a majority of which were paid for with debit cards, credit cards and checks, to which the Company does not have immediate access but settle within a few days of the sales transaction.\n​\nInventories\n​\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a last-in, first-out “LIFO” basis) or market.  In total, approximately\n92\n% of inventories in 2020 and\n91\n% of inventories in 2019 were valued using the LIFO method.  The remaining inventories, including substantially all fuel inventories, are stated at the lower of cost (on a FIFO basis) or net realizable value.  Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $\n1,373\nat January 30, 2021 and $\n1,380\nat February 1, 2020.  The Company follows the Link-Chain, Dollar-Value LIFO method for purposes of calculating its LIFO charge or credit.  During 2020, the Company had a LIFO liquidation primarily related to pharmacy inventory. The liquidated inventory was carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with current costs. The effect of this reduction in inventory decreased “Merchandise costs” by approximately $\n76\n, $\n58\nnet of tax.\n​\n53\n​\nThe item-cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the LIFO adjustment is followed for substantially all store inventories at the Company’s supermarket divisions.  This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts) of each item and recording the cost of items sold.\nThe item-cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory.  In addition, substantially all of the Company’s inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts).\n​\nThe Company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities.  Allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the financial statement date.\n​\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n​\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost or, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, at fair value.  Depreciation and amortization expense, which includes the depreciation of assets recorded under finance leases, is computed principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets.  Buildings and land improvements are depreciated based on lives varying from\n10\nto\n40 years\n.  All new purchases of store equipment are assigned lives varying from\nthree\nto\nnine years\n.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term to which they relate, which generally varies from\nfour\nto\n25 years\n, or the useful life of the asset.  Food production plant and distribution center equipment is depreciated over lives varying from\nthree\nto\n15 years\n.  Information technology assets are generally depreciated over\nthree\nto\nfive years\n.  Depreciation and amortization expense was $\n2,747\nin 2020, $\n2,649\nin 2019 and $\n2,465\nin 2018.\n​\nInterest costs on significant projects constructed for the Company’s own use are capitalized as part of the costs of the newly constructed facilities.  Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the balance sheet and any gain or loss is reflected in net earnings.  Refer to Note 4 for further information regarding the Company’s property, plant and equipment.\n​\nLeases\n​\nThe Company leases certain store real estate, warehouses, distribution centers, office space and equipment.  The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception.  Finance and operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date.  Finance and operating lease liabilities represent the present value of minimum lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments, lease incentives and impairment, if any. To determine the present value of lease payments, the Company estimates an incremental borrowing rate which represents the rate used for a secured borrowing of a similar term as the lease.\n​\nLease terms generally range from\n10\nto\n20 years\nwith\noptions\nto\nrenew\nfor\nvarying\nterms\nat the Company’s sole discretion. The lease term includes the initial contractual term as well as any options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.  Certain leases include escalation clauses or payment of executory costs such as property taxes, utilities or insurance and maintenance.  Operating lease payments are charged on a straight-line basis to rent expense over the lease term and finance lease payments are charged to interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense over the lease term.  Assets under finance leases are amortized in accordance with the Company’s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter.  The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.  For additional information on leases, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\n54\n​\nGoodwill\n​\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of a triggering event.  The Company performs reviews of each of its operating divisions and other consolidated entities (collectively, “reporting units”) that have goodwill balances.  Generally, fair value is determined using a market multiple model, or discounted projected future cash flows, and is compared to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment.  Projected future cash flows are based on management’s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future.  Goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  Results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2020, 2019 and 2018 are summarized in Note 3.\n​\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n​\nThe Company monitors the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred.  These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset.  When a triggering event occurs, an impairment calculation is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores.  If the Company identifies impairment for long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company compares the assets’ current carrying value to the assets’ fair value.  Fair value is based on current market values or discounted future cash flows.  The Company records impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value.  With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions.  Impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal.  The Company recorded asset impairments totaling $\n70\n, $\n120\nand $\n56\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The increase in the 2019 impairment charge, compared to 2020 and 2018, related to the\n35\nplanned store closures in 2020.  Costs to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets for each of the years presented have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as Operating, general and administrative (“OG&A”) expense.\n​\nAccounts Payable Financing Arrangement\n​\nThe Company has an agreement with a third party to provide an accounts payable tracking system\nwhich facilitates participating suppliers’ ability to finance payment obligations from the Company with designated third-party financial institutions.\nParticipating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to finance one or more payment obligations of the Company prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial institutions.  The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not affected by suppliers’ decisions to finance amounts under this arrangement.  These obligations are included in “Other current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\nContingent Consideration\n​\nThe Company’s Home Chef business combination involves potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones. The Company recorded contingent consideration at fair value at the date of acquisition based on the consideration expected to be transferred, estimated as the probability-weighted future cash flows, discounted back to present value using a discount rate determined in accordance with accepted valuation methods.  The liability for contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period using Level 3 inputs, and the change in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, is recognized in earnings until the contingency is resolved.  In 2020 and 2018, adjustments to increase the contingent consideration liability as of year-end were recorded for $\n189\nand $\n33\n, respectively, in OG&A expense. In 2019, an adjustment to decrease the contingent consideration liability as of year-end 2019 was recorded for ($\n69\n) in OG&A expense.\n​\n55\n​\nStore Closing Costs\n​\nThe Company regularly evaluates the performance of its stores and periodically closes those stores that are underperforming.  Related liabilities arise, such as severance, contractual obligations and other accruals associated with store closings.  The Company records a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the store closes.  Adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to actual exit costs differing from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known.\n​\nOwned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value. Costs to reduce the carrying values of property, plant, equipment and operating lease assets are accounted for in accordance with the Company’s policy on impairment of long-lived assets.  Inventory write-downs, if any, in connection with store closings, are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as “Merchandise costs.” Costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred.\n​\nInterest Rate Risk Management\n​\nThe Company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates.  The Company’s current program relative to interest rate protection and the methods by which the Company accounts for its derivative instruments are described in Note 7.\n​\nBenefit Plans and Multi-Employer Pension Plans\n​\nThe Company recognizes the funded status of its retirement plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost are required to be recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”).  The Company has elected to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of January 31, which is the\nmonth-end\nthat is closest to its fiscal year-ends, which were January 30, 2021 for fiscal 2020 and February 1, 2020 for fiscal 2019.\n​\nThe determination of the obligation and expense for company-sponsored pension plans and other post-retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of assumptions used by actuaries and the Company in calculating those amounts.  Those assumptions are described in Note 15 and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs.  Actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods.  While the Company believes that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense.\n​\nThe Company also participates in various multi-employer plans for substantially all union employees.  Pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable, in accordance with GAAP.  Refer to Note 16 for additional information regarding the Company’s participation in these various multi-employer pension plans.\n​\nThe Company administers and makes contributions to the employee 401(k)\nretirement savings accounts.  Contributions to the employee 401(k)\nretirement savings accounts are expensed when contributed or over the service period in the case of automatic contributions.  Refer to Note 15 for additional information regarding the Company’s benefit plans.\n​\n56\n​\nShare Based Compensation\n​\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payments granted under fair value recognition provisions. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, over the requisite service period of the award based on the fair value at the date of the grant.  The Company grants options for common shares (“stock options”) to employees under various plans at an option price equal to the fair market value of the stock option at the date of grant.  Stock options typically expire\n10 years\nfrom the date of grant. Stock options vest between\none\nand\nfive years\nfrom the date of grant.  In addition to stock options, the Company awards restricted stock to employees and nonemployee directors under various plans. The restrictions on these awards generally lapse between\none\nand\nfive years\nfrom the date of the awards. The Company determines the fair value for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the grant date of the award.\n​\nDeferred Income Taxes\n​\nDeferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting basis.  Refer to Note 5 for the types of differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\n​\nUncertain Tax Positions\n​\nThe Company reviews the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in its consolidated financial statements.  Refer to Note 5 for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other related disclosures related to uncertain tax positions.\n​\nVarious taxing authorities periodically audit the Company’s income tax returns.  These audits include questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, the Company records allowances for probable exposures.  A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which an allowance has been established, is audited and fully resolved.  As of January 30, 2021, the Internal Revenue Service had concluded its examination of all federal tax returns up to and including the return for the year ended January 30, 2016.\n​\nThe assessment of the Company’s tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with the Company’s various filing positions.\n​\nSelf-Insurance Costs\n​\nThe Company is primarily self-insured for costs related to workers’ compensation and general liability claims.  Liabilities are actuarially determined and are recognized based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported.  The liabilities for workers’ compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis.  The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage to limit its exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis.  The Company is insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits.\n​\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the Company’s self-insurance liability through January 30, 2021.\n​\n​\nThe current portion of the self-insured liability is included in “Other current liabilities,” and the long-term portion is included in “Other long-term liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\n57\n​\nThe Company maintains surety bonds related to self-insured workers’ compensation claims.  These bonds are required by most states in which the Company is self-insured for workers’ compensation and are placed with third-party insurance providers to insure payment of the Company’s obligations in the event the Company is unable to meet its claim payment obligations up to its self-insured retention levels.  These bonds do not represent liabilities of the Company, as the Company has recorded reserves for the claim costs.\n​\nThe Company also maintains insurance coverages for some risks, including cyber exposure and property-related losses.  The Company’s insurance coverage begins for these exposures ranging from\n$\n25\nto $\n50\n.\n​\nRevenue Recognition\n​\nSales\n​\nThe Company recognizes revenues from the\nretail\nsale\nof\nproducts, net of sales taxes,\nat\nthe point\nof\nsale.  Pharmacy sales\nare\nrecorded when the\nproduct is\nprovided\nto\nthe\ncustomer.  Digital channel originated sales are recognized either upon pickup in store or upon delivery to the customer.\nAmounts billed to a customer related to shipping and delivery represent revenues earned for the goods provided and are classified as sales.\nWhen shipping is discounted, it is recorded as an adjustment to sales.\nDiscounts provided\nto customers\nby\nthe Company\nat\nthe time\nof\nsale,\nincluding\nthose\nprovided\nin connection with\nloyalty\ncards,\nare recognized as\na\nreduction\nin sales\nas\nthe products\nare\nsold.\nDiscounts provided\nby\nvendors, usually in\nthe\nform\nof\ncoupons, are\nnot recognized\nas a\nreduction\nin\nsales provided\nthe\ncoupons\nare\nredeemable\nat\nany retailer that\naccepts\ncoupons.\nThe\nCompany\nrecords\na\nreceivable\nfrom\nthe vendor\nfor the\ndifference\nin\nsales price\nand\ncash received.\nFor merchandise sold in one of the Company’s stores or online, tender is accepted at the point of sale.  The Company acts as principal in certain vendor arrangements where the purchase and sale of inventory are virtually simultaneous. The Company records revenue and related costs on a gross basis for these arrangements.  For pharmacy sales, collection of third-party receivables is typically expected within\nthree months\nor less from the time of purchase.  The third-party receivables from pharmacy sales are recorded in Receivables in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and were $\n672\nas of January 30, 2021 and $\n646\nas of February 1, 2020.\n​\nGift Cards and Gift Certificates\n​\nThe\nCompany\ndoes\nnot\nrecognize\na\nsale when\nit\nsells\nits\nown gift\ncards\nand\ngift\ncertificates (collectively “gift cards”).\nRather, it records\na\ndeferred revenue\nliability equal to\nthe\namount\nreceived.\nA\nsale\nis\nthen\nrecognized when\nthe\ngift\ncards\nare\nredeemed\nto purchase\nthe\nCompany’s\nproducts.  The Company’s gift cards do not expire.  While gift cards are generally redeemed within\n12 months\n, some are never fully redeemed. The\nCompany\nrecognizes gift card\nbreakage under the\nproportional\nmethod,\nwhere\nrecognition\nof breakage income\nis based\nupon\nthe historical\nrun-off\nrate\nof\nunredeemed gift cards.\nThe Company’s gift card deferred revenue liability was $\n160\nas of January 30, 2021 and $\n114\nas of February 1, 2020.\n58\n​\nDisaggregated Revenues\n​\nThe\nfollowing table\npresents sales\nrevenue\nby type\nof product\nfor the year-ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019:\n​\n​\nMerchandise Costs\n​\nThe “Merchandise costs” line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations includes product costs, net of discounts and allowances; advertising costs (see separate discussion below); inbound freight charges; warehousing costs, including receiving and inspection costs; transportation costs; and food production and operational costs.  Warehousing, transportation and manufacturing management salaries are also included in the “Merchandise costs” line item; however, purchasing management salaries and administration costs are included in the OG&A line item along with most of the Company’s other managerial and administrative costs.  Shipping and delivery costs associated with the Company’s digital offerings originating from non-retail store locations are included in the “Merchandise costs” line item.  Rent expense and depreciation and amortization expense are shown separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n​\nWarehousing and transportation costs include distribution center direct wages, transportation direct wages, repairs and maintenance, utilities, inbound freight and, where applicable, third-party warehouse management fees.  These costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred.\n​\nThe Company believes the classification of costs included in merchandise costs could vary widely throughout the industry.  The Company’s approach is to include in the “Merchandise costs” line item the direct, net costs of acquiring products and making them available to customers in its stores.  The Company believes this approach most accurately presents the actual costs of products sold.\n​\nThe Company recognizes all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold.  When possible, vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and, therefore, reduce the carrying value of inventory by item.  When the items are sold, the vendor allowance is recognized.  When it is not possible, due to systems constraints, to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item, vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and, therefore, recognized as the product is sold.\n​\n59\n​\nAdvertising Costs\n​\nThe Company’s advertising costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred and are included in the “Merchandise costs” line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Company’s advertising costs totaled $\n888\nin 2020, $\n854\nin 2019 and $\n752\nin 2018.  The Company does not record vendor allowances for co-operative advertising as a reduction of advertising expense.\n​\nOperating, General and Administrative Expenses\nOG&A expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs such as wages, healthcare benefit costs, retirement plan costs, utilities, and credit card fees. Shipping and delivery costs associated with the Company's digital offerings originating from retail store locations, including third-party delivery fees, are included in the “OG&A” line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are shown separately in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n​\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n​\nFor purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be temporary cash investments.\n​\nSegments\n​\nThe Company operates supermarkets and multi-department stores throughout the United States.  The Company’s retail operations, which represent\n97\n% of the Company’s consolidated sales, are its only reportable segment.  The Company aggregated its operating divisions into\none\nreportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar long-term financial performance.  In addition, the Company’s operating divisions offer customers similar products, have similar distribution methods, operate in similar regulatory environments, purchase the majority of the merchandise for retail sale from similar (and in many cases identical) vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location, serve similar types of customers, and are allocated capital from a centralized location.  Operating divisions are organized primarily on a geographical basis so that the operating division management team can be responsive to local needs of the operating division and can execute company strategic plans and initiatives throughout the locations in their operating division. This geographical separation is the primary differentiation between these retail operating divisions.  The geographical basis of organization reflects how the business is managed and how the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who acts as the Company’s chief operating decision maker, assesses performance internally.  All of the Company’s operations are domestic.\n​\n​\n​\nOn May 17, 2018, the Company entered into a Partnership Framework Agreement with Ocado International Holdings Limited and Ocado Group plc (“Ocado”). The Partnership Framework Agreement was amended in 2020.  Under this agreement, Ocado will partner exclusively with the Company in the U.S., enhancing the Company’s digital and robotics capabilities in its distribution networks.  As part of the agreement, the Company provided a letter of credit which supports its commitment to contract with Ocado to build a number of fulfilment centers. The balance of the letter of credit was $\n207\nas of January 30, 2021 and will reduce primarily upon the construction of each fulfillment center.\n​\nIn addition, on May 17, 2018, the Company entered into a Share Subscription Agreement with Ocado, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase\n33.1\nmillion ordinary shares of Ocado for an aggregate purchase price of $\n243\n.  The Company completed the purchase of these\n33.1\nmillion shares on May 29, 2018.  This is in addition to\n8.1\nmillion Ocado shares purchased earlier in the first quarter of 2018, and\n6.5\nmillion additional shares purchased in the second quarter of 2018.  Fair value adjustments in equity of Ocado flow through “Gain on investments” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The fair value of all shares owned, which is measured using Level 1 inputs, was $\n1,808\nas of January 30, 2021 and $\n776\nas of February 1, 2020 and is included in “Other assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company recorded an unrealized gain of\n$\n1,032\nin 2020, $\n157\nin 2019 and $\n228\nin 2018,\nnone\nof which was realized during the period as the Company did not sell any Ocado securities.\n​\n​\n60\n​\n​\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the Company’s net goodwill balance through January 30, 2021.\n​\n​\nIn 2019, the Company finalized the purchase accounting for the Home Chef acquisition resulting in an increase of goodwill and deferred\ntaxes\nof $\n8\n.  The Company also recorded an impairment charge of $\n19\nas a result of the Lucky’s Market impairment.\n​\nTesting for impairment must be performed annually, or on an interim basis upon the occurrence of a triggering event or a change in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.  The annual evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets was performed during the fourth quarter of 2020, 2019 and 2018 and did not result in impairment.\n​\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s intangible assets balance through January 30, 2021.\n​\n​\n61\n​\nAmortization expense associated with intangible assets totaled approximately $\n67\n, $\n85\nand $\n80\n, during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Future amortization expense associated with the net carrying amount of definite-lived intangible assets for the years subsequent to 2020 is estimated to be approximately:\n​\n​\n​\n​\nProperty, plant and equipment, net consists of:\n​\n​\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization for leased property under finance leases was $\n321\nat January 30, 2021 and $\n276\nat February 1, 2020.\n​\nApproximately $\n152\nand $\n162\n, net book value, of property, plant and equipment collateralized certain mortgages at January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively.\n​\n62\n​\n​\nThe provision for taxes based on income consists of:\n​\n​\nA reconciliation of the statutory federal rate and the effective rate follows:\n​\n​\nThe 2020 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes, partially offset by the utilization of tax credits and deductions.\n​\nThe 2019 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes and Lucky’s Market losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest which reduced pre-tax income but did not impact tax expense.\n63\n​\nThe tax effects of significant temporary differences that comprise tax balances were as follows:\n​\n​\nAt January 30, 2021, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $\n1,081\n.  These net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2021 through 2040.\nThe utilization of certain of the Company’s state net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in a given year.  Further, based on the analysis described below, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against some of the deferred tax assets resulting from its state net operating losses.\n​\nAt January 30, 2021, the Company had state credit carryforwards of $\n38\n, most of which expire from 2021 through 2027.\nThe utilization of certain of the Company’s state credits may be limited in a given year. Further, based on the analysis described below, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against some of the deferred tax assets resulting from its state credits.\n​\nThe Company regularly reviews all deferred tax assets on a tax filer and jurisdictional basis to estimate whether these assets are more likely than not to be realized based on all available evidence.  This evidence includes historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies.  Projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned.  The expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and the Company’s tax methods of accounting.  Unless deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset until such time that realization becomes more likely than not.  Increases and decreases in these valuation allowances are included in \"Income tax expense\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAs of January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 the total valuation allowance was $\n53\n, $\n55\nand $\n54\n, respectively.\n​\n64\n​\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits, is as follows:\n​\n​\nAs of January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019 the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was $\n85\n, $\n74\nand $\n72\nrespectively.\n​\nTo the extent interest and penalties (recoveries) would be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense.  During the years ended\nJanuary 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, the Company recognized approximately $\n7\n, $\n7\nand $\n2\n, respectively, in interest and penalties (recoveries).  The Company had accrued approximately\n$\n38\n, $\n30\nand $\n30\nfor the payment of interest and penalties as of January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019.\n​\nAs of January 30, 2021, the Internal Revenue Service had concluded its examination of all federal tax returns up to and including the return for the year ended January 30, 2016. The Company anticipates resolution in the next\ntwelve\nto\neighteen months\nof Internal Revenue Service audits for tax years ending January 28, 2017 and February 3, 2018.\n​\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which was enacted on March 27, 2020, includes measures to assist companies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures include deferring the due dates of tax payments and other changes to income and non-income-based tax laws. As permitted under the CARES Act, the Company is deferring the remittance of the employer portion of the social security tax. The social security tax provision requires that the deferred employment tax be paid over\ntwo years\n, with half of the amount required to be paid by December 31, 2021 and the other half by December 31, 2022.  During 2020, the Company deferred the employer portion of social security tax of $\n622\n.  Of the total, $\n311\nis included in “Other current liabilities” and $\n311\nis included in “Other long-term liabilities” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\n​\nLong-term debt consists of:\n​\n​\n​\n65\n​\nIn 2020, the Company issued $\n500\nof senior notes due in fiscal year 2030 bearing an interest rate of\n2.20\n% and $\n500\nof senior notes due in fiscal year 2030 bearing interest rate of\n1.70\n%.  In connection with the senior note issuances, the Company also terminated forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $\n450\ndue in fiscal year 2030. These forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were hedging the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changing interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt issued during the fourth quarter of 2020.  Since these forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were classified as cash flow hedges, the unamortized loss of $\n41\n, $\n31\nnet of tax, has been deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and will continue to amortize to earnings as the interest payments are made.  The Company repaid $\n700\nof senior notes bearing an interest rate of\n3.30\n% with proceeds from the senior notes issuances.\n​\nOn March 18, 2020, the Company proactively borrowed $\n1,000\nunder the revolving credit facility. This was a precautionary measure in order to preserve financial flexibility, reduce reliance on the commercial paper market and maintain liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2020, the Company fully repaid the $\n1,000\nborrowed under the revolving credit facility and the entire $\n1,150\nin outstanding commercial paper obligations using cash generated by operations.\n​\nIn 2019, the Company issued $\n750\nof senior notes due in fiscal year 2049 bearing an interest rate of\n3.95\n%.  In connection with the senior note issuances, the Company also terminated forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $\n300\n. These forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were hedging the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changing interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt issued during the fourth quarter of 2019.  Since these forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were classified as cash flow hedges, the unamortized loss of $\n12\n, $\n10\nnet of tax, has been deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and will continue to amortize to earnings as the interest payments are made.  The Company repaid $\n750\nof senior notes bearing an interest rate of\n6.15\n%, with proceeds from the senior notes issuances.  During 2019, the Company also repaid, upon maturity, $\n1,000\nterm loan bearing an interest rate of\n3.37\n% and $\n500\nof senior notes bearing an interest rate of\n1.50\n%, using cash generated by operations and proceeds from issuing commercial paper.\n​\nOn August 29, 2017, the Company entered into an amended, extended and restated $\n2,750\nunsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”), with a termination date of August 29, 2022, unless extended as permitted under the Credit Agreement. The Company has the ability to increase the size of the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $\n1,000\n, subject to certain conditions.\n​\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (i) LIBOR plus a market spread, based on the Company’s Public Debt Rating or (ii) the base rate, defined as the highest of (a) the\nFederal Funds Rate\nplus\n0.5\n%, (b) the\nBank of America prime rate\n, and (c)\none-month LIBOR plus\n1.0\n%, plus a market rate spread based on the Company’s Public Debt Rating\n.  The Company will also pay a Commitment Fee based on its Public Debt Rating and Letter of Credit fees equal to a market rate spread based on the Company’s Public Debt Rating.  “Public Debt Rating” means, as of any date, the rating that has been most recently announced by either S&P or Moody’s, as the case may be, for any class of non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt issued by the Company.\n​\nThe Credit Agreement contains covenants, which, among other things, require the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio of not greater than\n3.50\n:1.00 and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of not less than\n1.70\n:1.00.  The Company may repay the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.  The Credit Agreement is not guaranteed by the Company’s subsidiaries.\n​\nAs of January 30, 2021, the Company had\nno\ncommercial paper borrowings and\nno\nborrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of February 1, 2020, the Company had $\n1,150\nof commercial paper borrowings, with a weighted average interest rate of\n1.77\n% and\nno\nborrowings under the Credit Agreement.\n​\nAs of January 30, 2021, the Company had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $\n381\n, of which $\n2\nreduces funds available under the Credit Agreement.  As of February 1, 2020, the Company had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $\n362\n, of which $\n2\nreduces funds available under the Credit Agreement.  The letters of credit are maintained primarily to support performance, payment, deposit or surety obligations of the Company.\n​\n66\n​\nMost of the Company’s outstanding public debt is subject to early redemption at varying times and premiums, at the option of the Company.  In addition, subject to certain conditions, some of the Company’s publicly issued debt will be subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of a redemption event, upon not less than\nfive days\n’ notice prior to the date of redemption, at a redemption price equal to the default amount, plus a specified premium.  “Redemption Event” is defined in the indentures as the occurrence of (i) any person or group, together with any affiliate thereof, beneficially owning\n50\n% or more of the voting power of the Company, (ii) any one person or group, or affiliate thereof, succeeding in having a majority of its nominees elected to the Company’s Board of Directors, in each case, without the consent of a majority of the continuing directors of the Company or (iii) both a change of control and a below investment grade rating.\n​\nThe aggregate annual maturities and scheduled payments of long-term debt, as of year-end 2020, and for the years subsequent to 2020 are:\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGAAP requires that derivatives be carried at fair value on the balance sheet and provides for hedge accounting when certain conditions are met.  The Company’s derivative financial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as “cash flow” hedges, to the extent the hedges are highly effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects.  Ineffective portions of cash flow hedges, if any, are recognized in current period earnings.  Other comprehensive income or loss is reclassified into current period earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.  Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as “fair value” hedges, along with corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged assets or liabilities, are recorded in current period earnings.  Ineffective portions of fair value hedges, if any, are recognized in current period earnings.\n​\nThe Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether derivatives used as hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged items.  If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or ceases to be highly effective, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.\n​\nInterest Rate Risk Management\n​\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of a commercial paper program, interest rate swaps (fair value hedges) and forward-starting interest rate swaps (cash flow hedges). The Company’s current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. To do this, the Company uses the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total amount that represents\n25\n% of the carrying value of the Company’s debt portfolio or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status.\n​\nThe Company reviews compliance with these guidelines annually with the Financial Policy Committee of the Board of Directors.  These guidelines may change as the Company’s needs dictate.\n​\n67\n​\nFair Value Interest Rate Swaps\n​\nThe Company did not have any outstanding interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020.\n​\nCash Flow Forward-Starting Interest Rate Swaps\n​\nThe Company did not have any outstanding forward-starting interest rate swap agreements as of January 30, 2021.\n​\nAs of February 1, 2020, the Company had\nseven\nforward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a maturity date of January 2021 with an aggregate notional amount totaling $\n350\n.  A forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt.  The Company entered into these forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on its forecasted issuance of debt in January 2021.  Accordingly, the forward-starting interest rate swaps were designated as cash-flow hedges as defined by GAAP.  As of February 1, 2020, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in other long-term liabilities for $\n19\nand accumulated other comprehensive loss for $\n17\nnet of tax.\n​\nDuring 2020, the Company terminated\nnine\nforward-starting interest rate swaps with maturity dates of January 2021 with an aggregate notional amount totaling $\n450\n.  These forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were hedging the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changing interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt issued during the fourth quarter of 2020.  Since these forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were classified as cash flow hedges, the unamortized loss of $\n41\n, $\n31\nnet of tax, has been deferred in AOCI and will be amortized to earnings as the interest payments are made.  In addition, the Company terminated and discontinued hedge accounting for\none\nforward-starting interest rate swap with a maturity date of January 2021 with an aggregate notional amount totaling $\n50\n.  The gain of $\n7\nfrom the termination of this forward starting interest rate swap was record in interest income in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n​\nDuring 2019, the Company terminated\nsix\nforward-starting interest rate swaps with maturity dates of January 2020 with an aggregate notional amount totaling $\n300\n.  These forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were hedging the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changing interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt issued during the fourth quarter of 2019.  Since these forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were classified as cash flow hedges, the unamortized loss of $\n12\n, $\n10\nnet of tax, has been deferred in AOCI and will be amortized to earnings as the interest payments are made.\n​\nThe following table summarizes the effect of the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges for 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n​\n​\n​\nFor the above cash flow interest rate swaps, the Company has entered into International Swaps and Derivatives Association master netting agreements that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts.  Under these master netting agreements, net settlement generally permits the Company or the counterparty to determine the net amount payable for contracts due on the same date and in the same currency for similar types of derivative transactions.  These master netting agreements generally also provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with a counterparty in the case of an event of default or a termination event.\n​\n68\n​\nCollateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of the Company under these master netting agreements. As of February 1, 2020,\nno\ncash collateral was received or pledged under the master netting agreements.\n​\nThe effect of the net settlement provisions of these master netting agreements on the Company’s derivative balances upon an event of default or termination event is as follows as of February 1, 2020:\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined in the standards are as follows:\n​\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n​\nLevel 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable;\n​\nLevel 3 - Unobservable pricing inputs in which little or no market activity exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\n​\nFor items carried at (or adjusted to) fair value in the consolidated financial statements, the following tables summarize the fair value of these instruments at January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020:\n​\nJanuary 30, 2021 Fair Value Measurements Using\n​\n​\nFebruary 1, 2020 Fair Value Measurements Using\n​\n​\nIn 2018, realized gains on Level 1, available-for-sale securities totaled $\n5\n.\n​\nThe Company values interest rate hedges using observable forward yield curves.  These forward yield curves are classified as Level 2 inputs.\n​\n69\n​\nThe equity investment in Ocado is measured at fair value through net earnings. The fair value of all shares owned, which is measured using Level 1 inputs, was $\n1,808\nand $\n776\nas of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively, and is included in “Other assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The unrealized gain for this level 1 investment was approximately $\n1,032\nand $\n157\nfor 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in “Gain on investments” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company held other equity investments without a readily determinable fair value. These investments are measured initially at cost and remeasured for observable price changes to fair value through net earnings. The value of these investments, which were measured using Level 3 inputs, was $\n160\nand $\n41\nat January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively, and is included in “Other assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The unrealized gain for these level 3 investments was approximately $\n73\nfor 2020 and is included in “Gain on investments” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n​\nFair value measurements of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities are primarily used in the impairment analysis of goodwill, other intangible assets, long-lived assets and in the valuation of store lease exit costs.  The Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and as circumstances indicate the possibility of impairment.  See Note 3 for further discussion related to the Company’s carrying value of goodwill.  Long-lived assets and store lease exit costs were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy.  See Note 1 for further discussion of the Company’s policies for impairments of long-lived assets and valuation of store lease exit costs.  In 2020, long-lived assets with a carrying amount of $\n72\nwere written down to their fair value of $\n2\n, resulting in an impairment charge of $\n70\n.  In 2019, long-lived assets with a carrying amount of $\n152\nwere written down to their fair value of $\n32\n, resulting in an impairment charge of $\n120\n, which included the\n35\nplanned store closures.\n​\nMergers are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price paid for a merger be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the merger, with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets being recorded as goodwill.\n​\nFair Value of Other Financial Instruments\n​\nCurrent and Long-term Debt\n​\nThe fair value of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities, was estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues adjusted for illiquidity based on available market evidence.  If quoted market prices were not available, the fair value was based upon the net present value of the future cash flow using the forward interest rate yield curve in effect at respective year-ends.  At January 30, 2021, the fair value of total debt excluding obligation under finance leases was $\n14,680\ncompared to a carrying value of $\n12,410\n. At February 1, 2020, the fair value of total debt excluding obligation under finance leases was $\n14,649\ncompared to a carrying value of $\n13,256\n.\n​\nContingent Consideration\n​\nAs a result of the Home Chef merger, the Company recognized a contingent liability of\n$\n91\non the acquisition date.  The contingent consideration was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs and was included in\n“Other long-term liabilities” within the Consolidated Balance Sheet\n. The Company estimated the fair value of the earnout liability by applying a\nMonte-Carlo simulation method\nusing the Company’s projection of future operating results for both the online and offline businesses related to the Home Chef merger and the estimated probability of achievement of the earnout target metrics.\nThe Monte-Carlo simulation is a generally accepted statistical technique used to generate a defined number of valuation paths in order to develop a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the earnout liability.\nThe liability is remeasured to fair value using the Monte-Carlo simulation method at each reporting period, and the change in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, is recognized in net earnings until the contingency is resolved.  In 2020, the Company amended the contingent consideration agreement including the performance milestones to align with the Company’s current business strategies.  In 2020, an adjustment to increase the contingent consideration liability as of year-end 2020 was recorded for $\n189\nin OG&A. In 2019, an adjustment to decrease the contingent consideration liability as of year-end 2019 was recorded for ($\n69\n) in OG&A.\n​\n70\n​\nCash and Temporary Cash Investments, Store Deposits In-Transit, Receivables, Prepaid and Other Current Assets, Trade Accounts Payable, Accrued Salaries and Wages and Other Current Liabilities\n​\nThe carrying amounts of these items approximated fair value.\n​\nOther Assets\n​\nThe fair values of certain investments recorded in “Other assets” within the Consolidated Balance Sheets were estimated based on quoted market prices for those or similar investments, or estimated cash flows, if appropriate.  Other assets include other long-term investments of $\n280\nand $\n261\nas of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively.  Other assets include notes receivable of $\n240\nand $\n210\nas of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively.  Other assets also include prepaid deposits under certain contractual arrangements of $\n186\nand $\n111\nas of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020.  The carrying value for these assets approximates fair value.\n​\n​\nThe following table represents the changes in AOCI by component for the years ended January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020:\n​\n71\n​\nThe following table represents the items reclassified out of AOCI and the related tax effects for the years ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019:\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThe Company leases certain store real estate, warehouses, distribution centers, office space and equipment.  The Company operates in leased facilities in approximately half of its store locations.\nLease\nterms\ngenerally range from\n10\nto\n20 years\nwith\noptions\nto\nrenew\nfor varying terms at the Company’s sole discretion.  Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property.  Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.  Certain leases include escalation clauses or payment of executory costs such as property taxes, utilities or insurance and maintenance. Rent expense for leases with escalation clauses or other lease concessions are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.  Certain properties or portions thereof are subleased to\nothers\nfor\nperiods\ngenerally ranging from\none\nto\n20 years\n.\n​\n72\n​\nThe following table provides supplemental balance sheet classification information related to leases:\n​\n​\nThe following table provides the components of lease cost:\n​\n​\n73\n​\nMaturities of operating and finance lease liabilities are listed below.  Amounts in the table include options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised.\n​\n​\nTotal future minimum rentals under non-cancellable subleases at January 30, 2021 were $\n261\n.\n​\nThe following table provides the weighted-average lease term and discount rate for operating and finance leases:\n​\n​\nThe following table provides supplemental cash flow information related to leases:\n​\n​\n74\n​\n​\nNet earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per basic common share equals net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. less income allocated to participating securities divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share equals net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. less income allocated to participating securities divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, after giving effect to dilutive stock options.  The following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. and shares used in calculating net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per basic common share to those used in calculating net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share:\n​\n​\nThe Company had combined undistributed and distributed earnings to participating securities totaling $\n29\n, $\n19\nand $\n34\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n​\nThe Company had stock options outstanding for approximately\n9.1\nmillion,\n18.4\nmillion and\n10.1\nmillion shares, respectively, for the years ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019, which were excluded from the computations of net earnings per diluted common share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect on net earnings per diluted share.\n​\n​\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payments granted. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, over the requisite service period of the award based on the fair value at the date of the grant.\n​\nThe Company grants options for common shares (“stock options”) to employees under various plans at an option price equal to the fair market value of the stock option at the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions. Stock options typically expire\n10 years\nfrom the date of grant. Stock options vest between\none\nand\nfive years\nfrom the date of grant.\n​\nIn addition to the stock options described above, the Company awards restricted stock to employees and nonemployee directors under various plans. The restrictions on these awards generally lapse between\none\nand\nfive years\nfrom the date of the awards.  The Company determines the fair value for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the grant date of the award.\n​\nAt January 30, 2021, approximately\n34\nmillion common shares were available for future options or restricted stock grants under the 2011, 2014, and 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plans (the “Plans”). Options granted reduce the shares available under the Plans at a ratio of\none\nto one.  Restricted stock grants reduce the shares available under the Plans at a ratio of\n2.83\nto one.\n​\nEquity awards granted are based on the aggregate value of the award on the grant date. This can affect the number of shares granted in a given year as equity awards. Excess tax benefits related to equity awards are recognized in the provision for income taxes. Equity awards may be approved\nat one of four meetings of its Board of Directors\noccurring shortly after the Company’s release of quarterly earnings. The 2020 primary grants were made in conjunction with the March and June meetings of the Company’s Board of Directors.\n​\nAll awards become immediately exercisable upon certain changes of control of the Company.\n​\n75\n​\nStock Options\n​\nChanges in options outstanding under the stock option plans are summarized below:\n​\n​\nA summary of options outstanding, exercisable and expected to vest at January 30, 2021 follows:\n​\n​\n76\n​\nRestricted stock\n​\nChanges in restricted stock outstanding under the restricted stock plans are summarized below:\n​\n​\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n6.43\n, $\n6.00\nand $\n6.78\n, respectively.  The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, based on the assumptions shown in the table below.  The Black-Scholes model utilizes accounting judgment and financial estimates, including the term option holders are expected to retain their stock options before exercising them, the volatility of the Company’s share price over that expected term, the dividend yield over the term and the number of awards expected to be forfeited before they vest.  Using alternative assumptions in the calculation of fair value would produce fair values for stock option grants that could be different than those used to record stock-based compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The increase in the fair value of the stock options granted during 2020, compared to 2019, resulted primarily from increases in the Company’s share price and the weighted average expected volatility, partially offset by a decrease in the interest rate.  The decrease in the fair value of the stock options granted during 2019, compared to 2018, resulted primarily from a decrease in the Company’s share price, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average expected volatility.\n​\nThe following table reflects the weighted-average assumptions used for grants awarded to option holders:\n​\n​\nThe weighted-average risk-free interest rate was based on the yield of a treasury note as of the grant date, continuously compounded, which matures at a date that approximates the expected term of the options.  The dividend yield was based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts.  Expected volatility was determined based upon historical stock volatilities; however, implied volatility was also considered.  Expected term was determined based upon historical exercise and cancellation experience.\n​\nTotal stock compensation recognized in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n185\n, $\n155\nand $\n154\n, respectively.  Stock option compensation recognized in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n22\n, $\n24\nand $\n25\n, respectively.  Restricted shares compensation recognized in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n163\n, $\n131\nand $\n129\n, respectively.\n​\n77\n​\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $\n115\n, $\n51\nand $\n58\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The total amount of cash received in 2020 by the Company from the exercise of stock options granted under share-based payment arrangements was $\n127\n.  As of January 30, 2021, there was $\n201\nof total unrecognized compensation expense remaining related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under Plans.  This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately\ntwo years\n.  The total fair value of options that vested was $\n23\n, $\n26\nand $\n30\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n​\nShares issued as a result of stock option exercises may be newly issued shares or reissued treasury shares.  Proceeds received from the exercise of options, and the related tax benefit, may be utilized to repurchase the Company’s common shares under a stock repurchase program adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors.  During 2020, the Company repurchased approximately\nfour\nmillion common shares in such a manner.\n​\n​\nThe Company continuously evaluates contingencies based upon the best available evidence.\n​\nThe Company believes that allowances for loss have been provided to the extent necessary and that its assessment of contingencies is reasonable.  To the extent that resolution of contingencies results in amounts that vary from the Company’s estimates, future earnings will be charged or credited.\n​\nThe principal contingencies are described below:\n​\nInsurance\n— The Company’s workers’ compensation risks are self-insured in most states. In addition, other workers’ compensation risks and certain levels of insured general liability risks are based on retrospective premium plans, deductible plans, and self-insured retention plans.  The liability for workers’ compensation risks is accounted for on a present value basis.  Actual claim settlements and expenses incident thereto may differ from the provisions for loss.  Property risks have been underwritten by a subsidiary and are all reinsured with unrelated insurance companies.  Operating divisions and subsidiaries have paid premiums, and the insurance subsidiary has provided loss allowances, based upon actuarially determined estimates.\n​\nLitigation —\nVarious claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business, including personal injury, contract disputes, employment discrimination, wage and hour and other regulatory claims are pending against the Company.  Some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions and/or seek substantial damages.  Although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits, nor their likelihood of success, the Company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n​\nThe Company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and when an adverse outcome is probable.  Nonetheless, assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involves substantial uncertainties.  Management currently believes that the aggregate range of loss for the Company’s exposure is not material to the Company.  It remains possible that despite management’s current belief, material differences in actual outcomes or changes in management’s evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n​\nAssignments —\nThe Company is contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions.  The Company could be required to satisfy the obligations under the leases if any of the assignees is unable to fulfill its lease obligations.  Due to the wide distribution of the Company’s assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available, the Company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote.\n​\n78\n​\n​\nPreferred Shares\n​\nThe Company has authorized\nfive\nmillion shares of voting cumulative preferred shares;\ntwo\nmillion shares were available for issuance at January 30, 2021.  The shares have a par value of $\n100\nper share and are issuable in series.\n​\nCommon Shares\n​\nThe Company has authorized\ntwo\nbillion common shares, $\n1\npar value per share.\n​\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\n​\nThe Company maintains stock repurchase programs that comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to allow for the orderly repurchase of The Kroger Co. common shares, from time to time.  The Company made open market purchases totaling $\n1,196\n, $\n400\nand $\n727\nunder these repurchase programs in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n​\nOn April 20, 2018 the Company entered and funded a $\n1,200\naccelerated stock repurchase (“ASR”) program to reacquire shares in privately negotiated transactions.  The final delivery under the ASR program occurred during the second quarter of 2018, which included the settlement of the remaining\n2.3\nmillion Kroger Common shares.  In total, the Company invested $\n1,200\nto repurchase\n46.3\nmillion Kroger common shares at an average price of $\n25.91\nper share.\n​\nIn addition to these repurchase programs, in December 1999, the Company began a program to repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from its employee stock option plans.  This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the related tax benefit.  The Company repurchased approximately $\n128\n, $\n65\nand $\n83\nunder the stock option program during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n​\n​\nThe Company administers non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans for some non-union employees and union-represented employees as determined by the terms and conditions of collective bargaining agreements.  These include several qualified pension plans (the “Qualified Plans”) and non-qualified pension plans (the “Non-Qualified Plans”).  The Non-Qualified Plans pay benefits to any employee that earns in excess of the maximum allowed for the Qualified Plans by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The Company only funds obligations under the Qualified Plans.  Funding for the company-sponsored pension plans is based on a review of the specific requirements and on evaluation of the assets and liabilities of each plan.\n​\nIn addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain health care benefits for retired employees.  Based on employee’s age, years of service and position with the Company, the employee may be eligible for retiree health care benefits.  Funding of retiree health care benefits occurs as claims or premiums are paid.\n​\nThe Company recognizes the funded status of its retirement plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost are required to be recorded as a component of AOCI.  The Company has elected to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of January 31, which is the\nmonth-end\nthat is closest to its fiscal year-ends, which were January 30, 2021 for fiscal 2020 and February 1, 2020 for fiscal 2019.\n​\n79\n​\nAmounts recognized in AOCI as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020 consists of the following (pre-tax):\n​\n​\nOther changes recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (pre-tax):\n​\n​\nInformation with respect to change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets, the funded status of the plans recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, net amounts recognized at the end of fiscal years, weighted average assumptions and components of net periodic benefit cost follow:\n​\n​\n80\n​\nAs of January 30, 2021, other assets and other current liabilities include $\n21\nand $\n35\n, respectively, of the net asset and liability recognized for the above benefit plans.  As of February 1, 2020, other assets and other current liabilities include $\n19\nand $\n33\n, respectively, of the net asset and liability recognized for the above benefit plans.\n​\nThe Company announced changes to certain non-union company-sponsored pension plans.  The Company froze the compensation and service periods used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the affected pension plans as of December 31, 2019.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the affected active employees no longer accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation received under these plans.\n​\nAs of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, pension plan assets do not include common shares of The Kroger Co.\n​\n​\nThe Company’s discount rate assumptions were intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled.\nThey take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans.  The Company’s policy is to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan’s projected benefit cash flows.  The discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows.  The selection of the\n2.72\n% and\n2.43\n% discount rates as of year-end 2020 for pension and other benefits, respectively, represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an AA or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant.  A\n100\nbasis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of January 30, 2021, by approximately $\n410\n.\n​\nThe Company’s 2020 assumed pension plan investment return rate was\n5.50\n% compared to\n6.00\n% in 2019 and\n5.90\n% in 2018.  The value of all investments in the company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ended December 31, 2020, net of investment management fees and expenses, increased\n16.9\n% and for fiscal year 2020 investments increased\n10.2\n%.  Historically, the Company’s pension plans’ average rate of return was\n7.7\n% for the\n10\ncalendar years ended December 31, 2020, net of all investment management fees and expenses.  For the past\n20 years\n, the Company’s pension plans’ average annual rate of return has been\n7.2\n%.  To determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by the Company, the Company considers current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories.\n​\nThe Company calculates its expected return on plan assets by using the market-related value of plan assets.  The market-related value of plan assets is determined by adjusting the actual fair value of plan assets for gains or losses on plan assets.  Gains or losses represent the difference between actual and expected returns on plan investments for each plan year.  Gains or losses on plan assets are recognized evenly over a\nfive-year\nperiod.  Using a different method to calculate the market-related value of plan assets would provide a different expected return on plan assets.\n​\nThe pension benefit unfunded status decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, due to higher than anticipated asset returns, partially offset by a decline in the discount rate from 2019 to 2020 and changes in demographic assumptions in 2020.\n​\n81\n​\nThe following table provides the components of the Company’s net periodic benefit costs for 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n​\n​\nThe following table provides the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) and the fair value of plan assets for those company-sponsored pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.\n​\n​\nThe following table provides the accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) and the fair value of plan assets for those company-sponsored pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.\n​\n​\nThe following table provides information about the Company’s estimated future benefit payments.\n​\n​\n82\n​\nThe following table provides information about the target and actual pension plan asset allocations as of January 30, 2021.\n​\n​\nInvestment objectives, policies and strategies are set by the Retirement Benefit Plan Management Committee (the “Committee”).  The primary objectives include holding and investing the assets and distributing benefits to participants and beneficiaries of the pension plans.  Investment objectives have been established based on a comprehensive review of the capital markets and each underlying plan’s current and projected financial requirements.  The time horizon of the investment objectives is long-term in nature and plan assets are managed on a going-concern basis.\n​\nInvestment objectives and guidelines specifically applicable to each manager of assets are established and reviewed annually.  Derivative instruments may be used for specified purposes, including rebalancing exposures to certain asset classes.  Any use of derivative instruments for a purpose or in a manner not specifically authorized is prohibited, unless approved in advance by the Committee.\n​\nThe target allocations shown for 2020 were established in 2020 in conjunction with the continuation of the Company’s transition to a LDI strategy, which began in 2017. A LDI strategy focuses on maintaining a close to fully-funded status over the long-term with minimal funded status risk.  This is achieved by investing more of the plan assets in fixed income instruments to more closely match the duration of the plan liability.  This LDI strategy will be phased in over time as the Company is able to transition out of illiquid investments.  During this transition, the Company’s target allocation will change by increasing the Company’s fixed income instruments.  Cash flow from employer contributions and redemption of plan assets to fund participant benefit payments can be used to fund underweight asset classes and divest overweight asset classes, as appropriate.  The Company expects that cash flow will be sufficient to meet most rebalancing needs.\n​\nThe Company did not make any contributions to its company-sponsored pension plans in 2020 and the Company is not required to make any contributions to these plans in 2021.  If the Company does make any contributions in 2021, the Company expects these contributions will decrease its required contributions in future years.  Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any contributions.  The Company expects 2021 net periodic benefit costs for company-sponsored pension plans to be approximately ($\n45\n).\n83\n​\nAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.  The Company used a\n5.50\n% initial health care cost trend rate, which is assumed to decrease on a linear basis to a\n4.50\n% ultimate health care cost trend rate in 2037, to determine its expense.\n​\nThe following tables, set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy, present the Qualified Plans’ assets at fair value as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020:\n​\nAssets at Fair Value as of January 30, 2021\n​\n​\nAssets at Fair Value as of February 1, 2020\n​\n​\nCertain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented for these investments in the preceding tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchies to the total fair value of plan assets.\n​\n84\n​\nFor measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during 2020 and 2019, a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances is as follows:\n​\n​\nSee Note 8 for a discussion of the levels of the fair value hierarchy.  The assets’ fair value measurement level above is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n​\nThe following is a description of the valuation methods used for the Qualified Plans’ assets measured at fair value in the above tables:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n85\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThe methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.  Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement.\n​\nThe Company contributed and expensed $\n294\n, $\n264\nand $\n263\nto employee 401(k)\nretirement savings accounts in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The 401(k) retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the Company based on participant contributions, compensation as defined by the plan and length of service.\n​\nIn 2019, the Company approved and implemented a plan to reorganize certain portions of its division management structure.  This reorganization increased operational effectiveness and reduced overhead costs while maintaining a high quality customer experience.  The Company recorded a charge for severance and related benefits of\n$\n80\n,\n$\n61\nnet of tax, in 2019, which is included in the OG&A caption within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOf the total charge, $\n42\nwas unpaid as of February 1, 2020 and was included in Other Current Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining balance was paid in 2020.\n​\n​\nThe Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements.  These multi-employer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers.  The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose.  Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions.  The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans.\n​\nThe Company recognizes expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are probable and reasonably estimable, in accordance with GAAP.  The Company made cash contributions to these plans of $\n619\nin 2020, $\n461\nin 2019 and $\n358\nin 2018.  The increase in 2020, compared to 2019 and 2018, is primarily due to incremental contributions of $\n236\n, $\n180\nnet of tax, to multi-employer pension plans, helping stabilize future associate benefits.\n​\n86\n​\nThe Company continues to evaluate and address potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans as it relates to the Company’s associates who are beneficiaries of these plans.  These under-fundings are not a liability of the Company.  When an opportunity arises that is economically feasible and beneficial to the Company and its associates, the Company may negotiate the restructuring of under-funded multi-employer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits and become the fiduciary of the restructured multi-employer pension plan.  The commitments from these restructurings do not change the Company’s debt profile as it relates to its credit rating since these off balance sheet commitments are typically considered in the Company’s investment grade debt rating.\n​\nThe Company is currently designated as the named fiduciary of the United Food and Commercial Workers (“UFCW”) Consolidated Pension Plan and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“IBT”) Consolidated Pension Fund and has sole investment authority over these assets. Due to opportunities arising, the Company has restructured certain multi-employer pension plans. The significant effects of these restructuring agreements recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements are:\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThe risks of participating in multi-employer pension plans are different from the risks of participating in single-employer pension plans in the following respects:\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThe Company’s participation in multi-employer plans is outlined in the following tables.  The EIN / Pension Plan Number column provides the Employer Identification Number (“EIN”) and the three-digit pension plan number.  The most recent Pension Protection Act Zone Status available in 2020 and 2019 is for the plan’s year-end at December 31, 2019 and December\n31, 2018, respectively.  Among other factors, generally, plans in the red zone are less than\n65\npercent funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than\n80\npercent funded and plans in the green zone are at least\n80\npercent funded.  The FIP/RP Status Pending / Implemented Column indicates plans for which a funding improvement plan (“FIP”) or a rehabilitation plan (“RP”) is either pending or has been implemented.  Unless otherwise noted, the information for these tables was obtained from the Forms 5500 filed for each plan’s year-end at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The multi-employer contributions listed in the table below are the Company’s multi-employer contributions made in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n​\n87\n​\nThe following table contains information about the Company’s multi-employer pension plans:\n​\n​\n88\n​\nThe following table describes (a) the expiration date of the Company’s collective bargaining agreements and (b) the expiration date of the Company’s most significant collective bargaining agreements for each of the material multi-employer funds in which the Company participates.\n​\n​\nThe Company held escrow deposits as of January 30, 2021, amounting to $\n271\ndue to certain restructuring agreements.  These payments are included in “Prepaid and other current assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\nBased on the most recent information available to it, the Company believes the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in most of these multi-employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits.  Moreover, if the Company were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds, the Company could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability.  Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and it can be reasonably estimated.\n​\nThe Company also contributes to various other multi-employer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to active and retired participants. Total contributions made by the Company to these other multi-employer health and welfare plans were approximately $\n1,262\nin 2020, $\n1,252\nin 2019 and $\n1,282\nin 2018.\n​\n​\nOn March 13, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its You Technology business to Inmar for total consideration of $\n565\n, including $\n396\nof cash and $\n64\nof preferred equity received upon closing. The Company is also entitled to receive other cash payments of $\n105\nover\nfive years\n. The transaction includes a long-term service agreement for Inmar to provide the Company digital coupon services. The sale resulted in a gain of $\n70\n, $\n52\nnet of tax, which is included in “Gain on sale of businesses” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company recorded the fair value of the long-term service agreement of $\n358\nin “Other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and such amount is being recorded as sales over the\n10-year\nagreement.\n​\nOn April 26, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its Turkey Hill Dairy business to an affiliate of Peak Rock Capital for total proceeds of $\n225\n. The sale resulted in a gain of $\n106\n, $\n80\nnet of tax, which is included in “Gain on sale of businesses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n​\n89\n​\nIn the third quarter of 2019, as a result of a portfolio review, the Company decided to divest its interest in Lucky’s Market. The Company recognized an impairment charge of $\n238\nin the third quarter of 2019, which is included in OG&A in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment charge consists of property, plant and equipment of $\n200\n, which includes $\n40\nof finance lease assets; goodwill of $\n19\n; operating lease assets of $\n11\n; and other charges of $\n8\n. The amount of the impairment charge attributable to The Kroger Co. is $\n131\n, $\n100\nnet of tax, with the remaining amount attributable to the minority interest.  Subsequently, the decision was made by Lucky’s Market to file for bankruptcy in January 2020, which led the Company to fully write off the value of its investment and deconsolidate Lucky’s Market from the consolidated financial statements.  This resulted in an additional non-cash charge of $\n174\n, $\n125\nnet of tax, in the fourth quarter of 2019, which is included in OG&A in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The amount of the total 2019 charge attributable to The Kroger Co. is $\n305\n, $\n225\nnet of tax.  The Company maintains liabilities associated with certain property related guarantees that will result in the Company making payments to settle these over time.\n​\n​\nOn February 4, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” which superseded previous revenue recognition guidance. Topic 606 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue when goods and services are transferred to the customer in an amount that is proportionate to what has been delivered at that point and that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled for those goods or services. The Company adopted the standard using a modified retrospective approach with the adoption primarily involving the evaluation of whether the Company acts as principal or agent in certain vendor arrangements where the purchase and sale of inventory are virtually simultaneous. The Company will continue to record revenue and related costs on a gross basis for the arrangements. The adoption of the standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n​\nOn February 3, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, “Leases,” which provides guidance for the recognition of lease agreements.  The Company adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach, which provides a method for recording existing leases at adoption that approximates the results of a full retrospective approach.  In addition, the Company elected the transition package of practical expedients permitted within the standard, which allowed it to carry forward the historical lease classification, and applied the transition option which does not require application of the guidance to comparative periods in the year of adoption.\n​\nThe adoption of the standard resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $\n6,800\nand $\n7,000\n, respectively, as of February 3, 2019.\nIncluded in the measurement of the new lease assets is the reclassification of certain balances including those historically recorded as prepaid or deferred rent and favorable and unfavorable leasehold interests.  Several other asset and liability line items in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were also impacted by immaterial amounts.  The adoption of this standard also resulted in a change in naming convention for leases classified historically as capital leases. These leases are now referred to as finance leases. The adoption of this standard did not materially affect the Company’s consolidated net earnings or cash flows.\n​\nIn February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2018-02, \"Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.\" This amendment allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings. The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 on February 3, 2019, which resulted in a decrease to AOCI and an increase to accumulated earnings of $\n146\n, primarily related to deferred taxes previously recorded for pension and other postretirement benefits and cash flow hedges.  The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows.\n​\n90\n​\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software: Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.” Under the new standard, implementation costs related to a cloud computing arrangement will be deferred or expensed as incurred, in accordance with the existing internal-use software guidance for similar costs. The new standard also prescribes the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow classification of the capitalized implementation costs and related amortization expense. The Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis in the first quarter of 2020.  Capitalized implementation costs of\n$\n81\n, net of accumulated amortization of $\n2\n, are included in “Other assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 30, 2021.  The corresponding cash flows related to these arrangements are included in “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n​\n​\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” This standard provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to certain contract modifications and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued. This guidance is effective upon issuance and can be applied through December 31, 2022. The Company may elect to apply the amendments for contract modifications by Topic or Industry Subtopic as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\n91\n​\n20.\nQUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)\n​\nThe two tables that follow reflect the unaudited results of operations for 2020 and 2019.\n​\n​\nAnnual amounts may not sum due to rounding.\n​\nNet earnings for the first quarter of 2020 include charges to OG&A of $\n60\n, $\n44\nnet of tax, for the revaluation of Home Chef  contingent consideration and $\n38\n, $\n28\nnet of tax, for transformation costs and gains in other income (expense) of $\n422\n, $\n312\nnet of tax, for the gain on investments.\n​\nNet earnings for the second quarter of 2020 include charges to OG&A of $\n25\n, $\n19\nnet of tax, for the revaluation of Home Chef contingent consideration and $\n29\n, $\n21\nnet of tax, for transformation costs and a gain in other income (expense) of $\n368\n, $\n278\nnet of tax, for the gain on investments.\n​\n92\n​\nNet earnings for the third quarter of 2020 include charges to OG&A of $\n24\n, $\n17\nnet of tax, for the revaluation of Home Chef contingent consideration and $\n33\n, $\n24\nnet of tax, for transformation costs and a gain in other income (expense) of $\n162\n, $\n115\nnet of tax, for the gain on investments.\n​\nNet earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 include charges to OG&A of $\n989\n, $\n754\nnet of tax, for commitments to certain multi-employer pension funds, $\n80\n, $\n61\nnet of tax, for the revaluation of Home Chef contingent consideration and $\n11\n, $\n8\nnet of tax, for transformation costs and a gain in other income (expense) of $\n153\n, $\n116\nnet of tax, for the gain on investments.\n​\n​\nAnnual amounts may not sum due to rounding.\n​\n93\n​\nNet earnings for the first quarter of 2019 include charges to OG&A expenses of $\n59\n, $\n44\nnet of tax, for obligations related to withdrawal liabilities for certain local unions of the Central States multi-employer pension fund and a reduction to OG&A of $\n24\n, $\n18\nnet of tax, for the revaluation of Home Chef contingent consideration and gains in other income of $\n106\n, $\n80\nnet of tax, related to the sale of Turkey Hill Dairy, $\n70\n, $\n52\nnet of tax, related to the sale of You Technology and $\n106\n, $\n80\nnet of tax, for the mark to market gain on Ocado.\n​\nNet earnings for the second quarter of 2019 include charges to OG&A of $\n27\n, $\n22\nnet of tax, for obligations related to withdrawal liabilities for a certain multi-employer pension fund and $\n2\n, $\n2\nnet of tax, for the revaluation of Home Chef contingent consideration, and a charge in other income (expense) of $\n45\n, $\n36\nnet of tax, for the mark to market loss on Ocado securities.\n​\nNet earnings for the third quarter of 2019 include a charge to OG&A of $\n45\n, $\n35\nnet of tax, for obligations related to withdrawal liabilities for a certain multi-employer pension fund, $\n80\n, $\n61\nnet of tax, for a severance charge and related benefits, $\n238\nincluding $\n131\nattributable to the Kroger Co., $\n100\nnet of tax, for impairment of Lucky’s Market and $\n4\n, $\n3\nnet of tax, for the revaluation of Home Chef contingent consideration and gain in other income of $\n106\n, $\n81\nnet of tax, for the mark to market gain on Ocado securities.\n​\nNet earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 include charges to OG&A of $\n4\n, $\n3\nnet of tax, for obligations related to withdrawal liabilities for certain multi-employer pension funds, $\n174\n, $\n125\nnet of tax, for deconsolidation and  impairment of Lucky’s Market, $\n52\n, $\n37\nnet of tax, for transformation costs, primarily including\n35\nplanned store closures and a reduction to OG&A of $\n51\n, $\n36\nnet of tax, for the revaluation of Home Chef contingent consideration and a loss in other income (expense) of $\n9\n, $\n6\nnet of tax, for the mark to market loss on Ocado securities.\n​\n94\n​"
