    "text": "You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this document.   Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Operating our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to control it have resulted in a significant decline in global economic activity and significant disruption of global supply chains.  Governments around the world have implemented stringent measures to help reduce the spread of the virus, including stay-at-home orders, business and school closures, travel restrictions and other measures.  The resulting downturn in economic activity has negatively impacted global demand and prices for crude oil, natural gas, NGL, refined petroleum products, CO\n2\n, steel, chemicals and other products that we handle in our pipelines, terminals, shipping vessels and other facilities. See Item 2. “\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—General—COVID-19.\n”  Continuing uncertainty regarding the global impact of COVID-19 is likely to result in continued weakness in demand and prices for the products on which our business depends.\nAs the pandemic and responses to it continue, we may experience further disruptions to commodities markets, supply chains and the health, availability and efficiency of our workforce, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and operations and limit our ability to execute on our business plan.  In addition, measures taken by regulatory authorities attempting to mitigate the economic consequences of COVID-19 may not be effective or may have unintended harmful consequences.  There are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding COVID-19 — including the pace and efficacy of vaccination efforts, the duration and severity of possible resurgences and the duration and extent of travel restrictions and business closures imposed in affected countries — to reasonably predict the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations.  COVID-19 may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to the global economic recession that is likely to result from the measures taken to combat the virus.  Further, adverse impacts from the pandemic may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks we face.\n21\nOur businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the products that we handle.\nOur pipelines, terminals and other assets and facilities, including the availability of expansion opportunities, depend in part on continued production of natural gas, crude oil and other products in the geographic areas that they serve.  Our business also depends in part on the levels of demand for natural gas, crude oil, NGL, refined petroleum products, CO\n2\n, steel, chemicals and other products in the geographic areas to which our pipelines, terminals, shipping vessels and other facilities deliver or provide service, and the ability and willingness of our shippers and other customers to supply such demand.  For example, without additions to crude oil and gas reserves, production will decline over time as reserves are depleted, and production costs may rise.  Producers may reduce or shut down production during times of lower product prices or higher production costs to the extent they become uneconomic.  Producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves, and our pipelines and related facilities may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput.\nCommodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at levels that encourage producers to explore for and develop additional reserves, produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire.  Additionally, demand for such products can decline due to situations over which we have no control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and various measures that federal, state and local authorities have implemented in response to the virus or its economic consequences.  See “—\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business.”\nIn addition to economic disruptions resulting from events such as COVID-19, conditions in the business environment generally, such as declining or sustained low commodity prices, supply disruptions, or higher development or production costs, could result in a slowing of supply to our pipelines, terminals and other assets.  Also, sustained lower demand for hydrocarbons, or changes in the regulatory environment or applicable governmental policies, including in relation to climate change or other environmental concerns, may have a negative impact on the supply of crude oil and other products.  In recent years, a number of initiatives and regulatory changes relating to reducing GHG emissions have been undertaken by federal, state and municipal governments and crude oil and gas industry participants.  In addition, public concern about the potential risks posed by climate change has resulted in increased demand for energy efficiency and a transition to energy provided from renewable energy sources, rather than fossil fuels, fuel-efficient alternatives such as hybrid and electric vehicles, and pursuit of other technologies to reduce GHG emissions, such as carbon capture and sequestration.  We may see an intensification of these trends if and to the extent that the new U.S. presidential administration succeeds in enacting its energy and environmental policies.\nThese factors could result in not only increased costs for producers of hydrocarbons but also an overall decrease in the demand for hydrocarbons.  Each of the foregoing could negatively impact our business directly as well as our shippers and other customers, which in turn could negatively impact our prospects for new contracts for transportation, terminaling or other midstream services, or renewals of existing contracts or the ability of our customers and shippers to honor their contractual commitments.  Furthermore, such unfavorable conditions may compound the adverse effects of larger disruptions such as COVID-19.  See “—\nFinancial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products\nor services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us”\nbelow.\nWe cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions, fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices, all of which could reduce the production of and/or demand for the products we handle.  In addition, irrespective of supply of or demand for products we handle, implementation of new regulations or changes to existing regulations affecting the energy industry could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe face competition from other pipelines and terminals, as well as other forms of transportation and storage.\nCompetition is a factor affecting our existing businesses and our ability to secure new project opportunities.  Any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation (such as barge, rail or truck) that delivers the products we handle into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price, location, facilities or other factors.  Likewise, competing terminals or other storage options may become more attractive to our customers.  To the extent that competitors offer the markets we serve more desirable transportation or storage options, or customers opt to construct their own facilities for services previously provided by us, this could result in unused capacity on our pipelines and in our terminals.  We also could experience competition for the supply of the products we handle from both existing and proposed pipeline systems; for example, several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to destinations not served by us.  If capacity on our assets remains unused, our ability to re-contract for expiring capacity at favorable rates or otherwise retain existing customers could be impaired.  In addition, to the\n22\nextent that companies pursuing development of carbon capture and sequestration technology are successful, they could compete with us for customers who purchase CO\n2\nfor use in enhanced oil recovery operations.\nThe volatility of crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices could adversely affect our CO\n2\nbusiness segment and businesses within our Natural Gas Pipelines and Products Pipelines business segments.\nThe revenues, cash flows, profitability and future growth of some of our businesses (and the carrying values of certain of their respective assets, which include related goodwill) depend to a large degree on prevailing crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices.\nPrices for crude oil, NGL and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil, NGL and natural gas, uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond our control.  These factors include, among other things (i) weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the U.S.; (ii) domestic and global economic conditions; (iii) the activities of the OPEC and other countries that are significant producers of crude oil (“OPEC+”); (iv) governmental regulation; (v) political instability in crude oil producing countries; (vi) the foreign supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas; (vii) the price of foreign imports; (viii) the proximity and availability of storage and transportation infrastructure and processing and treating facilities; and (ix) the availability and prices of alternative fuel sources.  We use hedging arrangements to partially mitigate our exposure to commodity prices, but these arrangements also are subject to inherent risks.  We are also subject, indirectly, to volatility of commodity prices, through many of our customers’ direct exposure to such volatility.  Please read\n“—Our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income.\n”\nIn 2020, the impact of COVID-19, combined with a dispute regarding production levels among OPEC+ countries, caused crude oil prices to reach historic lows.  By March 2020, crude oil was priced at less than $25 per barrel, the lowest price since April 1999.  Producers in the U.S. and globally did not reduce crude oil production at a rate sufficient to match the dramatic decline in economic activity that accelerated in March and April 2020, resulting in an oversupply of crude oil that caused the per-barrel price to fall below zero in April 2020.  While global oil demand has improved from the low levels experienced during these months last year and OPEC+ agreed on production cuts in April 2020, there is no assurance that demand will not decline to these levels again, that the OPEC+ agreement will continue to be observed by its parties or that the agreed production cuts will be sufficient to offset continuing demand weakness.  Downward pressure on commodity prices could continue for the foreseeable future.  If prices fall substantially or remain low for a sustained period and we are not sufficiently protected through hedging arrangements, we may be unable to realize a profit from these businesses and would operate at a loss.\nSharp declines in the prices of crude oil, NGL or natural gas (such as we experienced in the first half of 2020) or a prolonged unfavorable price environment, may result in a commensurate reduction in our revenues, income and cash flows from our businesses that produce, process, or purchase and sell crude oil, NGL, or natural gas, and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value (which includes assigned goodwill) of our CO\n2\nbusiness segment’s proved reserves, certain assets in certain midstream businesses within our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment, and certain assets within our Products Pipelines business segment.  For example, following the commodity price declines we experienced during the first half of 2020, we recorded a combined $1.950 billion of non-cash impairments associated with our Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated and CO\n2\nreporting units, primarily for impairments of goodwill and assets owned in these businesses.  See Note 3 “\nImpairments and Losses and Gains on Divestitures\n” and Note 8 “\nGoodwill\n” to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nIn recent decades, there have been periods worldwide of both overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons, and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts.  Such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of, and reduced demand for, crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis.  These periods have been followed by periods of short supply of, and increased demand for, crude oil and natural gas.  The cycles of excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas have placed pressures on prices and resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand.  These fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process.  For more information about our energy and commodity market risk, see Item 7A “\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n.”\nCommodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nThere are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to the transportation and storage of the products we handle, such as leaks; releases; the breakdown, underperformance or failure of equipment, facilities, information systems or processes; damage to our pipelines caused by third-party construction; the compromise of information and control systems; spills at\n23\nterminals and hubs; spills associated with the loading and unloading of harmful substances at rail facilities; adverse sea conditions (including storms and rising sea levels) and releases or spills from our shipping vessels or vessels loaded at our marine terminals; operator error; labor disputes/work stoppages; disputes with interconnected facilities and carriers; operational disruptions or apportionment on third-party systems or refineries on which our assets depend; and catastrophic events or natural disasters such as fires, floods, explosions, earthquakes, acts of terrorists and saboteurs, cyber security breaches, and other similar events, many of which are beyond our control.  Additional risks to our vessels include capsizing, grounding and navigation errors.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could result in serious injury and loss of human life, significant damage to property and natural resources, environmental pollution, significant reputational damage, impairment or suspension of operations, fines or other regulatory penalties, and revocation of regulatory approvals or imposition of new requirements, any of which also could result in substantial financial losses, including lost revenue and cash flow to the extent that an incident causes an interruption of service.  For pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the level of damage resulting from these risks may be greater.  In addition, the consequences of any operational incident (including as a result of adverse sea conditions) at one of our marine terminals may be even more significant as a result of the complexities involved in addressing leaks and releases occurring in the ocean or along coastlines and/or the repair of marine terminals.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions.\nAs described above, COVID-19 has resulted in a downturn of economic activity on a global scale.  The slowdown resulting from the pandemic has affected numerous industries, including the crude oil and gas industry, the steel industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services.  We could experience similar or compounded adverse impacts as a result of other global events affecting economic conditions.  In addition, uncertain or changing economic conditions within one or more geographic regions may affect our operating results within the affected regions.  Sustained unfavorable commodity prices, volatility in commodity prices or changes in markets for a given commodity might also have a negative impact on many of our customers, which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us.  See\n“—Financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us.”\nIn addition, decreases in the prices of crude oil, NGL and natural gas are likely to have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow.  See\n“—The volatility of crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices could adversely affect our CO\n2\nbusiness segment and businesses within our Natural Gas Pipelines and Products Pipelines business segments.”\nIf economic and market conditions (including volatility in commodity markets) globally, in the U.S. or in other key markets become more volatile or continue to deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us.\nWe are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers or other counterparties, such as hedging counterparties, joint venture partners and suppliers.  The global economic slowdown caused by COVID-19, and the coinciding extreme drop in crude oil prices, which was exacerbated by the effects of the pandemic, significantly impacted the financial condition of many companies, particularly exploration and production companies, including some of our customers or counterparties.  Many of our counterparties finance their activities through cash flow from operations or debt or equity financing, and some of them may be highly leveraged and may not be able to access additional capital to sustain their operations in the future.  Our counterparties are subject to their own operating, market, financial and regulatory risks, and some are experiencing, or may experience in the future, severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness.  Crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices were all lower on average in 2020 compared to 2019.  Further deterioration in crude oil prices, or a continuation of the existing low natural gas or NGL price environment, would likely cause severe financial distress to some of our customers with direct commodity price exposure and may result in additional customer bankruptcies.  Further, the security that is permitted to be obtained from such customers may be limited, including by FERC regulation.  While certain of our customers are subsidiaries of an entity that has an investment grade credit rating, in many cases the parent entity has not guaranteed the obligations of the subsidiary and, therefore, the parent’s credit ratings may have no bearing on such customers’ ability to pay us for the services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us.  See Note 2 “\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies—Allowance for Credit Losses\n” in our consolidated financial statements.\n24\nFurthermore, financially distressed customers might be forced to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services, which also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that such customers and key counterparties will not become financially distressed or that such financially distressed customers or counterparties will not default on their obligations to us or file for bankruptcy protection.  If one of such customers or counterparties files for bankruptcy protection, we likely would be unable to collect all, or even a significant portion of, amounts owed to us. Similarly, our contracts with such customers may be renegotiated at lower rates or terminated altogether.  Significant customer and other counterparty defaults and bankruptcy filings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to reputational risks and risks relating to public opinion.\nOur business, operations or financial condition generally may be negatively impacted as a result of negative public opinion.  Public opinion may be influenced by negative portrayals of the industry in which we operate as well as opposition to development projects.  In addition, market events specific to us could result in the deterioration of our reputation with key stakeholders.  Potential impacts of negative public opinion or reputational issues may include delays or stoppages in expansion projects, legal or regulatory actions or challenges, blockades, increased regulatory oversight, reduced support from regulatory authorities, challenges to regulatory approvals, difficulty securing financing for and cost overruns affecting expansion projects and the degradation of our business generally.\nReputational risk cannot be managed in isolation from other forms of risk.  Credit, market, operational, insurance, regulatory and legal risks, among others, must all be managed effectively to safeguard our reputation.  Our reputation and public opinion could also be impacted by the actions and activities of other companies operating in the energy industry, particularly other energy infrastructure providers, over which we have no control.  In particular, our reputation could be impacted by negative publicity related to pipeline incidents or unpopular expansion projects and due to opposition to development of hydrocarbons and energy infrastructure, particularly projects involving resources that are considered to increase GHG emissions and contribute to climate change.  Negative impacts from a compromised reputation or changes in public opinion (including with respect to the production, transportation and use of hydrocarbons generally) could include revenue loss, reduction in customer base, delays in obtaining, or challenges to, regulatory approvals with respect to growth projects and decreased value of our securities and our business.\nThe future success of our oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable.\nThe rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted.  Without successful development activities, the reserves, revenues and cash flows of the oil and gas producing assets within our CO\n2\nbusiness segment will decline.  We may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future.  Additionally, if we do not realize production volumes greater than, or equal to, our hedged volumes, we may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions.\nThe development of crude oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment.\nThe business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome.  Acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that, while they may be reasonable, are by their nature speculative.  It is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well.  Furthermore, the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment.  A variety of geological, operational and market-related factors, including, but not limited to, unusual or unexpected geological formations, pressures, equipment failures or accidents, fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering, pollution and other environmental risks, shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment, loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions, may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable.  A productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered, which impair or prevent the production of oil and/or gas from the well.  In addition, production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances.\n25\nOur use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income.\nWe engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our direct exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGL, including differentials between regional markets.  These hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when production is less than expected, when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations, or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received.  In addition, these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGL.  Furthermore, our hedging arrangements cannot hedge against any decrease in the volumes of products we handle.  See “\n—Our businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the products that we handle.”\nThe markets for instruments we use to hedge our commodity price exposure generally reflect then-prevailing conditions in the underlying commodity markets.  As our existing hedges expire, we will seek to replace them with new hedging arrangements.  To the extent then-existing underlying market conditions are unfavorable, new hedging arrangements available to us will reflect such unfavorable conditions, limiting our ability to hedge our exposure to unfavorable commodity prices.\nThe accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex, and even when we engage in hedging transactions (for example, to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates) that are effective economically, these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes.  Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges, even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those consolidated financial statements.  In addition, it may not be possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that completely eliminate our exposure to commodity prices; therefore, our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge.  For more information about our hedging activities, see Item 7, “\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Hedging Activities\n” and Note 14 “\nRisk Management\n” to our consolidated financial statements.\nA breach of information security or failure of one or more key information technology or operational (IT) systems, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our business, results of operations or business reputation.\nOur business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. Some of the operational systems we use are owned or operated by independent third-party vendors. The various uses of these IT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to, controlling our pipelines and terminals with industrial control systems, collecting and storing information and data, processing transactions, and handling other processing necessary to manage our business.\nWhile we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our IT and data systems from such attacks, we can provide no assurance that our cybersecurity program will be effective.  In compliance with state and local stay-at-home orders issued in connection with COVID-19, a number of our employees have transitioned to working from home.  As a result, more of our employees are working from locations where our cybersecurity program may be less effective and IT security may be less robust.  We have experienced an increase in the number of attempts by external parties to access our networks or our company data without authorization.  The risk of a disruption or breach of our operational systems, or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations, through an act of terrorism or cyber sabotage event has increased as attempted attacks have advanced in sophistication and number around the world.\nIf any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  A significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption in our systems, which may result from problems such as malware, computer viruses, hacking attempts or third-party error or malfeasance, could result in a disruption of our operations, customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues.  Efforts by us and our vendors to develop, implement and maintain security measures, including malware and anti-virus software and controls, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, and any network and information systems-related events could require us to expend significant resources to remedy such event.  In the future, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.\n26\nAttacks, including acts of terrorism or cyber sabotage, or the threat of such attacks, may adversely affect our business or reputation.\nThe U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other infrastructure assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or “cyber sabotage” events.  For example, in 2018, a cyber attack on a shared data network forced four U.S. natural gas pipeline operators to temporarily shut down computer communications with their customers.  Potential targets include our pipeline systems, terminals, processing plants or operating systems.  The occurrence of an attack could cause a substantial decrease in revenues and cash flows, increased costs to respond or other financial loss, damage to our reputation, increased regulation or litigation or inaccurate information reported from our operations.  There is no assurance that adequate cyber sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future.  These developments may subject our operations to increased risks, as well as increased costs, and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or could harm our business reputation.\nHurricanes, earthquakes, flooding and other natural disasters, as well as subsidence and coastal erosion and climate-related physical risks, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our pipelines, terminals and other assets are located in, and our shipping vessels operate in, areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding and other natural disasters or could be impacted by subsidence and coastal erosion.  These natural disasters and phenomena could potentially damage or destroy our assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport.  Many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels, increased intensity of weather, and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding.  These climate-related changes could result in damage to physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone and rain-susceptible regions.  In addition, we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather.  Natural disasters and phenomena can similarly affect the facilities of our customers.  In either case, losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially.  See Items 1 and 2 “\nBusiness and Properties—Narrative Description of Business—Environmental Matters\n.”\nOur insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs or liabilities that we may experience, and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums.\nOur insurance program may not cover all operational risks and costs and may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim.  We do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses and could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.  Losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the insurance markets subsequent to certain hurricanes and natural disasters have made it more difficult and more expensive to obtain certain types of coverage.  The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance, or failure by one or more of our insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Insurance companies may reduce the insurance capacity they are willing to offer or may demand significantly higher premiums or deductibles to cover our assets.  If significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the energy industry occur, we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost.  There is no assurance that our insurers will renew their insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of non-renewal.  The unavailability of full insurance coverage to cover events in which we suffer significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExpanding our existing assets and constructing new assets is part of our growth strategy.  Our ability to begin and complete construction on expansion and new-build projects may be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining, or our inability to obtain, permits and rights-of-way, as well as public opposition, increases in costs of construction materials, cost overruns, inclement weather and other delays.  Should we pursue expansion of or construction of new projects through joint ventures with others, we will share control of and any benefits from those projects.\nWe regularly undertake major construction projects to expand our existing assets and to construct new assets.  New growth projects generally will be subject to, among other things, the receipt of regulatory approvals, feasibility and cost analyses, funding availability and industry, market and demand conditions.  If we pursue joint ventures with third parties, those parties may share approval rights over major decisions, and may act in their own interests.  Their views may differ from our own or our views of the interests of the venture which could result in operational delays or impasses, which in turn could affect the\n27\nfinancial expectations of and our expected benefits from the venture.  A variety of factors outside of our control, such as difficulties in obtaining permits and rights-of-way or other regulatory approvals, have caused, and may continue to cause, delays in or cancellations of our construction projects.  Regulatory authorities may modify their permitting policies in ways that disadvantage our construction projects, such as the FERC’s consideration of changes to its Certificate Policy Statement.  Such factors can be exacerbated by public opposition to our projects.  See “—\nWe are subject to reputational risks and risks relating to public opinion.\n”  For example, changing public attitudes toward pipelines bearing fossil fuels may impede our ability to secure rights-of-way or governmental reviews and authorizations on a timely basis or at all.  Inclement weather, natural disasters and delays in performance by third-party contractors have also resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs or delays in construction.  Significant increases in costs of construction materials, cost overruns or delays, or our inability to obtain a required permit or right-of-way, could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment, results of operations and cash flows, and could result in project cancellations or limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities.\nSubstantially all of the land on which our pipelines are located is owned by third parties.  If we are unable to procure and maintain access to land owned by third parties, our revenue and operating costs, and our ability to complete construction projects, could be adversely affected.\nWe must obtain and maintain the rights to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land, including private landowners, railroads, public utilities and others.  While our interstate natural gas pipelines in the U.S. have federal eminent domain authority, the availability of eminent domain authority for our other pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipeline—petroleum liquids, natural gas, CO\n2\n, or crude oil—and the laws of the particular state.  In any case, we must compensate landowners for the use of their property, and in eminent domain actions, such compensation may be determined by a court.  If we are unable to obtain rights-of-way on acceptable terms, our ability to complete construction projects on time, on budget, or at all, could be adversely affected.  In addition, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our right-of-way or rental agreements with landowners, primarily through renewals of expiring agreements and rental increases.  If we were to lose these rights, our operations could be disrupted or we could be required to relocate the affected pipelines, which could cause a substantial decrease in our revenues and cash flows and a substantial increase in our costs.\nThe acquisition of additional businesses and assets is part of our growth strategy.  We may experience difficulties completing acquisitions or integrating new businesses and properties, and we may be unable to achieve the benefits we expect from any future acquisitions.\nPart of our business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses and assets.  We evaluate and pursue assets and businesses that we believe will complement or expand our operations in accordance with our growth strategy.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to complete acquisitions in the future or achieve the desired results from any acquisitions we do complete.  Any acquired business or assets will be subject to many of the same risks as our existing businesses and may not achieve the levels of performance that we anticipate.\nIf we do not successfully integrate acquisitions, we may not realize anticipated operating advantages and cost savings.  Integration of acquired companies or assets involves a number of risks, including (i) the loss of key customers of the acquired business; (ii) demands on management related to the increase in our size; (iii) the diversion of management’s attention from the management of daily operations; (iv) difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting, budgeting, reporting, internal controls and other systems; and (v) difficulties in the retention and assimilation of necessary employees.\nWe may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately.  Successful integration of each acquisition will depend upon our ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs.  Difficulties in integration may be magnified if we make multiple acquisitions over a relatively short period of time.  Because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations, we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other size-related benefits that we hoped to achieve after these acquisitions, which would harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce, and difficulties recruiting and retaining our workforce could result in a failure to implement our business plans.\nOur operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce, including engineers, technical personnel and other professionals.  We and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce.  In addition, many of our current employees are retirement eligible and have significant institutional knowledge that must be transferred to other employees.  If we are unable to (i) retain current employees; (ii) successfully complete the\n28\nknowledge transfer; and/or (iii) recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience, our business could be negatively impacted.  In addition, we could experience increased costs to retain and recruit these professionals.\nIf we are unable to retain our executive officers, our ability to execute our business strategy, including our growth strategy, may be hindered.\nOur success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive officers, particularly Richard D. Kinder, our Executive Chairman and one of our founders, Steve Kean, our Chief Executive Officer, and Kim Dang, our President.  Along with the other members of our senior management, Messrs. Kinder and Kean and Ms. Dang have been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy.  If we are not successful in retaining Mr. Kinder, Mr. Kean, Ms. Dang or our other executive officers, or replacing them, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.  We do not maintain key personnel insurance.\nRisks Related to Financing Our Business\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $33.4 billion of consolidated debt (excluding debt fair value adjustments).  Additionally, we and substantially all of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries are parties to a cross guarantee agreement under which each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees the indebtedness of each other party, which means that we are liable for the debt of each of such subsidiaries.  This level of consolidated debt and the cross guarantee agreement could have important consequences, such as (i) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or potential growth, or for other purposes; (ii) increasing the cost of our future borrowings; (iii) limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt; (iv) placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt; and (v) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to service our consolidated debt, and our ability to meet our consolidated leverage targets, will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.  If our consolidated cash flow is not sufficient to service our consolidated debt, and any future indebtedness that we incur, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing dividends, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or seeking additional equity capital.  We may also take such actions to reduce our indebtedness if we determine that our earnings (or consolidated EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our revolving credit facility) may not be sufficient to meet our consolidated leverage targets or to comply with consolidated leverage ratios required under certain of our debt agreements.  We may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.  For more information about our debt, see Note 9 “\nDebt\n” to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit.\nAdverse changes to the availability, terms and cost of capital, interest rates or our credit ratings (which would have a corresponding impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries that are party to the cross guarantee agreement) could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital, including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar terms, which could in turn reduce our cash flows and limit our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities.  Our credit ratings may be impacted by our leverage, liquidity, credit profile and potential transactions.  Although the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities, our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our and our subsidiaries’ debt securities and the terms available to us for future issuances of debt securities.\nAlso, disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability, impacting our ability to finance our operations on favorable terms.  A significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n29\nOur and our customers’ access to capital could be affected by evolving financial institutions’ policies concerning businesses linked to fossil fuels.\nOur and our customers’ access to capital could be affected by financial institutions’ evolving policies concerning businesses linked to fossil fuels.  Public opinion toward industries linked to fossil fuels continues to evolve.  Concerns about the potential effects of climate change have caused some to direct their attention towards sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in such companies.  Ultimately, this could make it more difficult for our customers to secure funding for exploration and production activities or for us to secure funding for growth projects, and consequently could both indirectly affect demand for our services and directly affect our ability to fund construction or other capital projects.\nOur large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately $5.2 billion of our approximately $33.4 billion of consolidated debt (excluding debt fair value adjustments) was subject to variable interest rates, either as short-term or long-term variable-rate debt obligations, or as long-term fixed-rate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps.  Our interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2020 include $2.5 billion of variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements and $900 million of fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements that expire during 2021.  Should interest rates increase, the amount of cash required to service variable-rate debt would increase, as would our costs to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness, and our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nFor more information about our interest rate risk, see Item 7A “\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk.\n”\nAcquisitions and growth capital expenditures may require access to external capital.  Limitations on our access to external financing sources could impair our ability to grow.\nWe have limited amounts of internally generated cash flows to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures.  If our internally generated cash flows are not sufficient to fund one or more capital projects or acquisitions, we may have to rely on external financing sources, including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities, to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures.  Limitations on our access to external financing sources, whether due to tightened capital markets, more expensive capital or otherwise, could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.\nOur debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs.\nThe instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that may be beneficial to us.  Some of the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on (i) incurring additional debt; (ii) entering into mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; (iii) granting liens; and (iv) entering into sale-leaseback transactions.  The instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more limiting restrictions.  Our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be restricted.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nThe FERC or state public utility commissions, such as the CPUC, may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us.  In addition, the FERC, state public utility commissions or our customers could initiate proceedings or file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines, which could have an adverse impact on us.\nThe profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers.  To the extent that our costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the FERC or state public utility commissions to recover in our rates, or to the extent that there is a lag before we can file for and obtain rate increases, such events can have a negative impact on our operating results.\nOur existing rates may also be challenged by complaint.  Regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge, and have challenged, the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations.  Some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates.  Further, the FERC may continue to initiate investigations to determine whether interstate natural gas pipelines have over-collected on rates charged to shippers.  We may face challenges, similar to\n30\nthose described in Note 18 “\nLitigation and Environmental\n” to our consolidated financial statements, to the rates we charge on our pipelines.  Any successful challenge to our rates could materially adversely affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\nNew laws, policies, regulations, rulemaking and oversight, as well as changes to those currently in effect, could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and operations.\nOur assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal, state and local regulatory authorities.  Legislative changes, as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies, have the potential to adversely affect our profitability.  Additional regulatory burdens and uncertainties will be created if and to the extent that the new U.S. presidential administration succeeds in enacting more stringent energy and environmental policies.  For example, on January 27, 2021, the President issued an executive order directing, among other matters, the reevaluation of the leasing program for federally managed lands and the “pause” of new oil and natural gas leases on public lands pending completion of the review.  These and other initiatives of the new presidential administration may affect our assets and operations directly or indirectly, such as by preventing or delaying the exploration for and production of natural gas and liquids that we transport.\nRegulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as (i) federal, state and local taxation; (ii) rates (which include tax, reservation, commodity, surcharges, fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for), operating terms and conditions of service; (iii) the types of services we may offer to our customers; (iv) the contracts for service entered into with our customers; (v) the certification and construction of new facilities; (vi) the costs of raw materials, such as steel, which may be affected by tariffs or otherwise; (vii) the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations; (viii) acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses; (ix) the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of services or facilities; (x) reporting and information posting requirements; (xi) the maintenance of accounts and records; and (xii) relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the energy businesses.\nShould we fail to comply with any applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and orders of regulatory authorities, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines and potential loss of government contracts.  Furthermore, new laws, regulations or policy changes sometimes arise from unexpected sources.  New laws or regulations, unexpected policy changes or interpretations of existing laws or regulations, applicable to our income, operations, assets or another aspect of our business, could have a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.  For more information, see Items 1 and 2 “\nBusiness and Properties—Narrative Description of Business—Industry Regulation\n.”\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety.  Such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our past, present and future operations, and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals.  Liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under CERCLA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Clean Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act or analogous state laws as a result of the presence or release of hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances into or through the environment, and these laws may require response actions and remediation and may impose liability for natural resource and other damages.  Private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage.  Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs and/or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations including required permits and other approvals also may expose us to civil, criminal and administrative fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could harm our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.  For example, if an accidental leak, release or spill of liquid petroleum products, chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines, shipping vessels or storage or other facilities, we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak, release or spill, pay government penalties, address natural resource damage, compensate for human exposure or property damage, install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures.  The resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our earnings and cash flows.\nWe own and/or operate numerous properties and equipment that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities.  While we believe we have utilized operating, handling and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time, hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties and equipment owned, operated or used by us or our predecessors, or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes\n31\nhave been taken for disposal.  In addition, many of these properties have been owned and/or operated by third parties whose management, handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control.  These properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the U.S. such as CERCLA, which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct.  Under such laws and implementing regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, including contamination caused by prior owners or operators.  Imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position.\nFurther, we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us.  For example, the Federal Clean Air Act and other similar federal and state laws are subject to periodic review and amendment, which could result in more stringent emission control requirements obligating us to make significant capital expenditures at our facilities.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate.  Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.  For more information, see Items 1 and 2\n“\nBusiness and Properties—Narrative Description of Business—Environmental Matters.”\nIncreased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines may require us to incur significant capital and operating expense outlays to comply.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity at the federal and state level.  There are, for example, federal guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for pipeline companies in the areas of operations, testing, education, training and communication.  The ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict.  The majority of compliance costs relate to pipeline integrity testing and repairs.  Technological advances in in-line inspection tools, identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in “High Consequence Areas” can have a significant impact on integrity testing and repair costs.  We plan to continue our integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the DOT rules.  The results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines.\nFurther, additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate.  Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nClimate-related risk and related regulation could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs for us and could reduce demand for our products and services.\nVarious laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of GHGs such as methane and CO\n2\n, including the EPA programs to control GHG emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs.  Existing EPA regulations require us to report GHG emissions in the U.S. from sources such as our larger natural gas compressor stations, fractionated NGL, and production of naturally occurring CO\n2\n(for example, from our McElmo Dome CO\n2\nfield), even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere.  Proposed approaches to further address GHG emissions include establishing GHG “cap and trade” programs, increased efficiency standards, participation in international climate agreements, issuance of executive orders by the U.S. presidential administration and incentives or mandates for pollution reduction, use of renewable energy sources, or use of alternative fuels with lower carbon content.  For more information about climate change regulation, see Items 1 and 2 “\nBusiness and Properties—Narrative Description of Business—Environmental Matters—Climate Change.”\nAdoption of any such laws or regulations could increase our costs to operate and maintain our facilities and could require us to install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances for our GHG emissions, pay taxes related to our GHG emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program, and such increased costs could be significant.  Recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC.  Such laws or regulations could also lead to reduced demand for\n32\nhydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to GHGs, or restrictions on their use, which in turn could adversely affect demand for our products and services.\nFinally, many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events, which may lead to higher insurance costs, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather.  These climate-related changes could result in damage to our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone and rain-susceptible regions.\nAny of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreased regulation of exploration and production activities, including activity on public lands and hydraulic fracturing, could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, as well as reductions in production from existing wells, which could adversely impact the volumes of natural gas transported on our natural gas pipelines and our own oil and gas development and production activities.\nWe gather, process or transport crude oil, natural gas or NGL from several areas, including lands that are federally managed.  Policy and regulatory initiatives of the new presidential administration or legislation by Congress may decrease access to federally managed lands and increase the regulatory burdens associated with using these lands to produce crude oil or natural gas.  For example, on January 20, 2021, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior issued an order temporarily restricting the authorization of new leases or permits to drill without the approval of a senior Department official.  On January 27, 2021, the President issued an executive order directing, among other matters, the reevaluation of the leasing program for federally managed lands and the “pause” of new oil and natural gas leases on public lands pending completion of the review.\nThe use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent in areas where we have operations.  Oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control.  The oil and gas industry is increasingly relying on supplies of hydrocarbons from unconventional sources, such as shale, tight sands and coal bed methane.  The extraction of hydrocarbons from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing.  Hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized injection of water, sand, and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells.  There have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing.  Adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators, which could reduce their production of crude oil, natural gas or NGL and, in turn, adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of these commodities that we handle.\nIn addition, many states are promulgating stricter requirements related not only to well development but also to compressor stations and other facilities in the oil and gas industry sector.  These laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation.  Specifically, these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling, restrictions on drilling activities and location, emissions into the environment, water discharges, transportation of hazardous materials, and storage and disposition of wastes.  In addition, legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities.  These laws and regulations may adversely affect our oil and gas development and production activities.\nThe Jones Act includes restrictions on ownership by non-U.S. citizens of our U.S. point to point maritime shipping vessels, and failure to comply with the Jones Act, or changes to or a repeal of the Jones Act, could limit our ability to operate our vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade, result in the forfeiture of our vessels or otherwise adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and operations.\nWe are subject to the Jones Act, which generally restricts U.S. point-to-point maritime shipping to vessels operating under the U.S. flag, built in the U.S., owned and operated by U.S.-organized companies that are controlled and at least 75% owned by U.S. citizens and crewed by predominately U.S. citizens.  Our business would be adversely affected if we fail to comply with the Jones Act provisions on coastwise trade.  If we do not comply with any of these requirements, we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade and, under certain circumstances, we could be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved transfer to non-U.S. citizens that could result in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading rights for our vessels, fines or forfeiture of vessels.  Our business could be adversely affected if the Jones Act were to be modified or repealed so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same U.S. government imposed burdens.\n33\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Capital Stock\nThe guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates.  Circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business.\nWe disclose in this report and elsewhere the expected cash dividends on our common stock.  These reflect our current judgment, but as with any estimate, they may be affected by inaccurate assumptions and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  See “\nInformation Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n” at the beginning of this report.  If our board of directors elects to pay dividends at the anticipated level and that action would leave us with insufficient cash to take timely advantage of growth opportunities (including through acquisitions), to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements, to fund our operations, to maintain our leverage metrics or otherwise to address properly our business prospects, our business could be harmed.\nConversely, a decision to address such needs might lead to the payment of dividends below the anticipated levels.  As events present themselves or become reasonably foreseeable, our board of directors, which determines our business strategy and our dividends, may decide to address those matters by reducing our anticipated dividends.  Alternatively, because nothing in our governing documents or credit agreements prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends, we could choose to incur debt to enable us to pay our anticipated dividends.  This would add to our substantial debt discussed above under “\n—Risks Related to Financing Our Business—Our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions\n.”\nOur certificate of incorporation restricts the ownership of our common stock by non-U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act.  These restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in non-U.S. citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss.\nThe Jones Act requires, among other things, that at least 75% of our common stock be owned at all times by U.S. citizens, as defined under the Jones Act, in order for us to own and operate vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade.  As a safeguard to help us maintain our status as a U.S. citizen, our certificate of incorporation provides that, if the number of shares of our common stock owned by non-U.S. citizens exceeds 22%, we have the ability to redeem shares owned by non-U.S. citizens to reduce the percentage of shares owned by non-U.S. citizens to 22%.  These redemption provisions may adversely impact the marketability of our common stock, particularly in markets outside of the U.S.  Further, those stockholders would not have control over the timing of such redemption, and may be subject to redemption at a time when the market price or timing of the redemption is disadvantageous.  In addition, the redemption provisions might have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger, tender offer or proxy contest by a non-U.S. citizen, even if it were favorable to the interests of some or all of our stockholders."

Additional sections in this report which should be helpful to the reading of our discussion and analysis include the following: (i) a description of our business strategy found in Items 1 and 2 “\nBusiness and Properties—Narrative Description of Business—Business Strategy;\n” (ii) a description of developments during 2020, found in Items 1 and 2 “\nBusiness and Properties—General Development of Business—Recent Developments;\n” (iii) a description of risk factors affecting us and our business, found in Item 1A\n“\nRisk Factors;\n” and (iv) a discussion of forward-looking statements, found in “\nInformation Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n” at the beginning of this report.\n35\nA comparative discussion of our 2019 to 2018 operating results can be found in Item 7 “\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations\n” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on February 7, 2020.\nGeneral\nAs an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the various U.S. energy industries and markets, we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future.  We have four business segments as further described below.\nNatural Gas Pipelines\nThis segment owns and operates (i) major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems; (ii) natural gas gathering systems and processing and treating facilities; (iii) NGL fractionation facilities and transportation systems; and (iv) LNG regasification, liquefaction and storage facilities.\nWith respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines, related storage facilities and LNG terminals, the revenues from these assets are primarily received under long-term fixed contracts.  To the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors, we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms, with higher per-unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity.  These long-term contracts are typically structured with a fixed fee reserving the right to transport or store natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available, whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity.  Similarly, our Texas Intrastate natural gas pipeline operations, currently derives approximately 83% of its sales and transport margins from long-term transport and sales contracts.  As contracts expire, we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas.  As of December 31, 2020, the remaining weighted average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts held by assets we own and have equity interests in (including intrastate pipelines’ sales portfolio) was approximately\nsix years. Our LNG regasification and liquefaction and associated storage contracts are subscribed under long-term agreements with a weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 13 years.\nOur midstream assets provide natural gas gathering and processing services.  These assets are mostly fee-based and the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas, processing natural gas in order to remove NGL from the natural gas stream, and fractionating NGL into its base components, are affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems.  Such volumes are impacted by producer rig count and drilling activity.  In addition to fee-based arrangements, some of which may include minimum volume commitments, we also provide some services based on percent-of-proceeds, percent-of-index and keep-whole contracts.  Our service contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement, but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above, which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices.\nProducts Pipelines\nThis segment owns and operates refined petroleum products, crude oil and condensate pipelines that primarily deliver, among other products, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, crude oil and condensate to various markets.  This segment also owns and/or operates associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities.\nThe profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business generally is driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services. We also have 49 liquids terminals in this business segment that store fuels and offer blending services for ethanol and biodiesel.  The transportation and storage volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored.  Demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth, and, with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions, demand tends to be relatively stable.  Because of that, we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines and terminals located in, or that transport to, stable or growing markets and population centers.  The prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the U.S. Producer Price Index and a FERC index rate.\nOur crude, condensate and refined petroleum products transportation services are primarily provided pursuant to (i) either FERC or state tariffs and (ii) long-term contracts that normally contain minimum volume commitments.  As a result of these contracts, our settlement volumes are generally not sensitive to changing market conditions in the shorter term; however, the revenues and earnings we realize from our pipelines and terminals are affected by the volumes of crude oil, refined petroleum\n36\nproducts and condensate available to our pipeline systems, which are impacted by the level of oil and gas drilling activity and product demand in the respective regions that we serve.  Our petroleum condensate processing facility splits condensate into its various components, such as light and heavy naphtha, under a long-term fee-based agreement with a major integrated oil company.\nTerminals\nThis segment owns and operates (i) liquids and bulk terminal facilities located throughout the U.S. that store and handle various commodities including gasoline, diesel fuel, chemicals, ethanol, metals and petroleum coke; and (ii) Jones Act-qualified tankers.\nThe factors impacting our Terminals business segment generally differ between liquid and bulk terminals, and in the case of a bulk terminal, the type of product being handled or stored.  Our liquids terminals business generally has long-term contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity.  Thus, similar to our natural gas pipelines business, our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to short-term changes in supply and demand.  Therefore, the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts\n(which on average is approximately three years), the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported, and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time.\nAs with our refined petroleum products pipelines transportation business, the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle and/or store, as well as the prices we receive for our services, which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored.  While we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals, the primary products are petroleum coke, metals and ores. In addition, the majority of our contracts for this business contain minimum volume guarantees and/or service exclusivity arrangements under which customers are required to utilize our terminals for all or a specified percentage of their handling and storage needs.  The profitability of our minimum volume contracts is generally unaffected by short-term variation in economic conditions; however, to the extent we expect volumes above the minimum and/or have contracts which are volume-based, we can be sensitive to changing market conditions.  To the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors, we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms, with higher per-unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity.  In addition, weather-related events, including hurricanes, may impact our facilities and access to them and, thus, the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or, in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities, for longer periods.\nIn addition to liquid and bulk terminals, we also own Jones Act-qualified tankers in our Terminals business segment.  As of December 31, 2020, we have sixteen Jones Act-qualified tankers that operate in the marine transportation of crude oil, condensate and refined products in the U.S. and are primarily operating pursuant to multi-year fixed price charters with major integrated oil companies, major refiners and the U.S. Military Sealift Command.\nCO\n2\nThis segment (i) manages the production, transportation and marketing of CO\n2\nto oil fields that use CO\n2\nas a flooding medium to increase recovery and production of crude oil from mature oil fields; (ii) owns interests in and/or operates oil fields and gasoline processing plants in West Texas; and (iii) owns and operates a crude oil pipeline system in West Texas.\nThe CO\n2\nsource and transportation business primarily has third-party contracts with minimum volume requirements, which as of December 31, 2020, had a remaining average contract life of approximately eight years.  CO\n2\nsales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed.  Our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil, but with a floor price.  On a volume-weighted basis, for third-party contracts making deliveries in 2020, and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2021 budget, approximately 100% of our revenue is based on a fixed fee or floor price.  Our success in this portion of the CO\n2\nbusiness segment can be impacted by the demand for CO\n2\n.  In the CO\n2\nbusiness segment’s oil and gas producing activities, we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add.  The revenues we receive from our crude oil and NGL sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products.  Over the long-term, we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products.  In the shorter term, however, market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management, or hedging, program, in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed, capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts, particularly for crude oil.  The realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel, with the hedges allocated to oil, was $53.78 per barrel in 2020 and $49.49 per barrel in 2019.  Had we not used energy derivative\n37\ncontracts to transfer commodity price risk, our crude oil sales prices would have averaged $38.32 per barrel in 2020 and $55.12 per barrel in 2019.\nAlso, see Note 15\n“Revenue Recognition”\nto our consolidated financial statements for more information about the types of contracts and revenues recognized for each of our segments.\nSale of U.S. Portion of Cochin Pipeline System and KML\nOn December 16, 2019, we closed on two cross-conditional transactions resulting in the sale of the U.S. portion of the Cochin Pipeline system and all the outstanding equity of KML, including our 70% interest, to Pembina Pipeline Corporation (Pembina) (together, the “KML and U.S. Cochin Sale”).  We received approximately 25 million shares of Pembina common equity for our interest in KML.  On January 9, 2020, we sold our shares of Pembina and received proceeds of approximately $907 million ($764 million after tax) which were used to repay maturing debt.  The assets sold were part of our Natural Gas Pipelines and Terminals business segments.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic-related reduction in energy demand and the dramatic decline in commodity prices that began to impact us in the first quarter of 2020 continued to cause disruptions and volatility.  Sharp declines in crude oil and natural gas production along with reduced demand for refined products due to the economic shutdown in the wake of the pandemic affected our business and continues to do so.  While we have seen some meaningful recovery during the second half of the year in demand for refined products that we move through our terminals, significant uncertainty remains regarding the duration and extent of the impact of the pandemic on the energy industry, including demand and prices for the products handled by our pipelines, terminals, shipping vessels and other facilities, although we expect to see further recovery as vaccines are distributed and more normal societal activity resumes.\nThe events as described above resulted in decreases of current and estimated long-term crude oil and NGL sale prices and volumes we expect to realize and in significant reductions to the market capitalization of many midstream and oil and gas producing companies.  These events triggered us to review the carrying value of our long-lived assets and recoverability of goodwill for interim periods in addition to our annual testing.  Our evaluations resulted in the recognition during the first six months of 2020 of a $350 million impairment for long-lived assets in our CO\n2\nbusiness segment and goodwill impairments of $1,000 million and $600 million to our Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated and CO\n2\nreporting units, respectively.  For a further discussion of these impairments and our risk for future impairments, see Note 3, “\nImpairments and Losses and Gains on Divestitures\n.”\nWe have placed a priority on protecting our employees during this pandemic while continuing to provide essential services to our customers.  We continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control guidelines for those employees that perform essential tasks in our operations and have taken a cautious enterprise-wide approach with a phased return to workplace process for our employees who are currently working remotely.  During 2020, our incremental employee safety costs associated with COVID-19 mitigation were approximately $15 million, primarily for personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning protocols, temperature screening and other measures we adopted to protect our employees.  We continue to operate our assets safely and efficiently during this challenging period.\n2021 Dividends and Discretionary Capital\nWe expect to declare dividends of $1.08 per share for 2021, a 3% increase from the 2020 declared dividends of $1.05 per share.  We also expect to invest $0.8 billion in expansion projects and contributions to joint ventures during 2021.\nThe expectations for 2021 discussed above involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and are not guarantees of performance.  Many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict, and because of these uncertainties, it is advisable not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statement.  Please read our Item 1A “\nRisk Factors\n” below and “\nInformation Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n” at the beginning of this report for more information.  Furthermore, we plan to provide updates to these 2021 expectations when we believe previously disclosed expectations no longer have a reasonable basis.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAccounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates, and the application of GAAP involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment.  Certain amounts included in or\n38\naffecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared.  These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities, our revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements.  We routinely evaluate these estimates, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances.  Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates, and any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining:  (i) revenue recognition; (ii) income taxes; (iii) the economic useful lives of our assets and related depletion rates; (iv) the fair values used in (a) calculations of possible asset and equity investment impairment charges, and (b) calculation for the annual goodwill impairment test (or interim tests if triggered); (v) reserves for environmental claims, legal fees, transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities; (vi) provisions for credit losses; (vii) computation of the gain or loss, if any, on assets sold in whole or in part; and (viii) exposures under contractual indemnifications.\nFor a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2\n“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”\nto our consolidated financial statements.  We believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others, which policies are discussed as follows.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWith respect to our environmental exposure, we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts.  We expense or capitalize, as appropriate, environmental expenditures that relate to current operations, and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs.  Generally, we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value, and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable.  We record at fair value, where appropriate, environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nOur accrual of environmental liabilities often coincides either with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action, but generally, we recognize and/or adjust our probable environmental liabilities, if necessary or appropriate, following quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations.  In recording and adjusting environmental liabilities, we consider the effect of environmental compliance, pending legal actions against us, and potential third party liability claims.  For more information on environmental matters, see Part I, Items 1 and 2 “\nBusiness and Properties—Narrative Description of Business—Environmental Matters.\n”  For more information on our environmental disclosures, see Note 18\n“Litigation and Environmental”\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nLegal and Regulatory Matters\nMany of our operations are regulated by various U.S. regulatory bodies, and we are subject to legal and regulatory matters as a result of our business operations and transactions.  We utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders, judgments or settlements.  In general, we expense legal costs as incurred.  When we identify contingent liabilities that are probable, we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to resolve the matter.  Generally, if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount, we record a liability equal to the low end of the range.  Any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available.  Accordingly, to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings will be affected.  For more information on legal proceedings, see Note 18\n“Litigation and Environmental”\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nLong-lived Asset and Equity Investment Impairments\nWe evaluate long-lived assets including leases and investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount of an asset or investment may not be recoverable.  We recognize impairment losses when estimated future cash flows expected to result from our use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount.  Because the impairment test for long-lived assets held in use is based on undiscounted cash flows, there may be instances where an asset or asset group is not considered impaired, even when its fair value may be less than its carrying value, because the asset or asset group is recoverable based on the cash flows to be generated over the estimated life of the asset\n39\nor asset group.  If the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is in excess of undiscounted cash flows, we typically use discounted cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment is required.\nFor more information on our long-lived asset impairments and significant estimates and assumptions used in our evaluations, see Note 3\n“Impairments and Losses and Gains on Divestitures.”\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance.  Identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives, including goodwill, are not subject to regular periodic amortization, and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite.  Instead, the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value.  We evaluate goodwill for impairment on May 31 of each year.  At year end and during other interim periods we evaluate our reporting units for events and changes that could indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount.\nExcluding goodwill, our other intangible assets include customer contracts and relationships and agreements.  These intangible assets have definite lives, are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives, and are reported separately as “Other intangibles, net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nFor more information on our 2020 goodwill impairment evaluations and amortizable intangibles, see Note 3\n“Impairments and Losses and Gains on Divestitures”\nand Note 8\n“Goodwill”\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nHedging Activities\nWe engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate (offset) our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices, foreign currency exposure on Euro-denominated debt, and until our recent divestitures of our Canadian assets, net investments in foreign operations, and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates, and we believe that these derivative contracts are, or were in respect to our Canadian operations, generally effective in realizing these objectives.  According to the provisions of GAAP, to be considered effective, changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the hedged risk, and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be recognized in earnings over the life of the hedging instrument by using a systematic and rational method.\nAll of our derivative contracts are recorded at estimated fair value.  We utilize published prices, broker quotes, and estimates of market prices to estimate the fair value of these contracts; however, actual amounts could vary materially from estimated fair values as a result of changes in market prices. In addition, changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. We do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 14\n“Risk Management”\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status.  As of December 31, 2020, our pension plans were underfunded by\n$645 million, and our OPEB plans were overfunded by $62 million.  Our pension and OPEB obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations.  We use various assumptions in performing these calculations, including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets, the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term, the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors.  A significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations.  We utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our pension and OPEB plans which applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows.  The selection of these assumptions is further discussed in Note 10\n“Share-based Compensation and Employee Benefits\n” to our consolidated financial statements.\nActual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations, and as a result, our estimates associated with our pension and OPEB can be, and have been revised in subsequent periods.  The income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of expected\n40\nfuture service of active participants, or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants.  As of December 31, 2020, we had deferred net losses of approximately $521 million in pre-tax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our pension and OPEB plans.\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows the estimated impact of a 1% change in the primary assumptions used in our actuarial calculations associated with our pension and OPEB plans for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n(a)\nIncludes amounts deferred as either accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) or as a regulatory asset or liability for certain of our regulated operations.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense is recorded based on an estimate of the effective tax rate in effect or to be in effect during the relevant periods. Changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations in the period in which such changes are enacted. We do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed. Therefore, we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate. Changes in our effective rate, including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes, are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount that is more likely than not to not be realized. While we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance, any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached.\nIn determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments, we apply an accounting policy that looks through our investments. The application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the non-tax-deductible goodwill portion of our investments, including KMI’s investment in its wholly-owned subsidiary, KMP.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nAs described in further detail below, our management evaluates our performance primarily using the GAAP financial measures of Segment EBDA (as presented in Note 16, “\nReportable Segments\n”), net income and net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc., along with the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted Earnings and DCF, both in the aggregate and per share for each, Adjusted Segment EBDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA.\n41\nGAAP Financial Measures\nThe Consolidated Earnings Results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 present Segment EBDA, net income and net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Segment EBDA is a useful measure of our operating performance because it measures the operating results of our segments before DD&A and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers, such as general and administrative expenses and corporate charges, interest expense, net, and income taxes.  Our general and administrative expenses and corporate charges include such items as unallocated employee benefits, insurance, rentals, unallocated litigation and environmental expenses, and shared corporate services including accounting, information technology, human resources and legal services.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur non-GAAP financial measures described below should not be considered alternatives to GAAP net income or other GAAP measures and have important limitations as analytical tools.  Our computations of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.  You should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.  Management compensates for the limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures by reviewing our comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes.\nCertain Items\nCertain Items, as adjustments used to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures, are items that are required by GAAP to be reflected in net income, but typically either (i) do not have a cash impact (for example, asset impairments), or (ii) by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically (for example, certain legal settlements, enactment of new tax legislation and casualty losses).  We also include adjustments related to joint ventures (see “Amounts from Joint Ventures” below and the tables included in\n“—Consolidated Earnings Results (GAAP)—Certain Items Affecting Consolidated Earnings Results,”\n“—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA” and “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Supplemental Information”\nbelow).  In addition, Certain Items are described in more detail in the footnotes to tables included in\n“—Segment Earnings Results”\nand\n“—DD&A, General and Administrative and Corporate Charges, Interest, net and Noncontrolling Interests”\nbelow.\nAdjusted Earnings\nAdjusted Earnings is calculated by adjusting net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. for Certain Items.  Adjusted Earnings is used by us and certain external users of our financial statements to assess the earnings of our business excluding Certain Items as another reflection of our ability to generate earnings.  We believe the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted Earnings is net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.  Adjusted Earnings per share uses Adjusted Earnings and applies the same two-class method used in arriving at basic earnings per common share.  See\n“—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. (GAAP) to Adjusted Earnings to DCF”\nbelow.\nDCF\nDCF is calculated by adjusting net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. for Certain Items (Adjusted Earnings), and further by DD&A and amortization of excess cost of equity investments, income tax expense, cash taxes, sustaining capital expenditures and other items.  We also include amounts from joint ventures for income taxes, DD&A and sustaining capital expenditures (see “Amounts from Joint Ventures” below).  DCF is a significant performance measure useful to management and external users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance and in measuring and estimating the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt, paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital, that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends, stock repurchases, retirement of debt, or expansion capital expenditures.  DCF should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under GAAP.  We believe the GAAP measure most directly comparable to DCF is net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.  DCF per common share is DCF divided by average outstanding common shares, including restricted stock awards that participate in common share dividends.  See\n“—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. (GAAP) to Adjusted Earnings to DCF”\nand\n“—Adjusted Segment EBDA to Adjusted EBITDA to DCF”\nbelow.\n42\nAdjusted Segment EBDA\nAdjusted Segment EBDA is calculated by adjusting Segment EBDA for Certain Items attributable to the segment.  Adjusted Segment EBDA is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business.  We believe Adjusted Segment EBDA is a useful performance metric because it provides management and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate cash earnings on an ongoing basis.  We believe it is useful to investors because it is a measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment’s performance.  We believe the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted Segment EBDA is Segment EBDA.  See\n“—Consolidated Earnings Results (GAAP)—Certain Items Affecting Consolidated Earnings Results”\nfor a reconciliation of Segment EBDA to Adjusted Segment EBDA by business segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting EBITDA for Certain Items.  We also include amounts from joint ventures for income taxes and DD&A (see “Amounts from Joint Ventures” below).  Adjusted EBITDA is used by management and external users, in conjunction with our Net Debt (as described further below), to evaluate certain leverage metrics.  Therefore, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors.  We believe the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income.  See\n“—Adjusted Segment EBDA to Adjusted EBITDA to DCF”\nand\n“—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA”\nbelow\n.\nAmounts from Joint Ventures\nCertain Items, DCF and Adjusted EBITDA reflect amounts from unconsolidated joint ventures and consolidated joint ventures utilizing the same recognition and measurement methods used to record “Earnings from equity investments” and “Noncontrolling interests,” respectively.  The calculations of DCF and Adjusted EBITDA related to our unconsolidated and consolidated joint ventures include the same adjustments (DD&A and income tax expense, and for DCF only, also cash taxes and sustaining capital expenditures) with respect to the joint ventures as those included in the calculations of DCF and Adjusted EBITDA for our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries.  (See\n“—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Supplemental Information”\nbelow.)  Although these amounts related to our unconsolidated joint ventures are included in the calculations of DCF and Adjusted EBITDA, such inclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues, expenses or cash flows of such unconsolidated joint ventures.  DCF and Adjusted EBITDA are further adjusted for certain KML activities attributable to our noncontrolling interests in KML for the periods presented through KML’s sale on December 16, 2019, see\n“—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Supplemental Information—KML Activities Prior to December 16, 2019”\nbelow.\nNet Debt\nNet Debt is calculated, based on amounts as of December 31, 2020, by subtracting the following amounts from our debt balance of $34,689 million:  (i) cash and cash equivalents of $1,184 million; (ii) debt fair value adjustments of $1,293 million; and (iii) the foreign exchange impact on Euro-denominated bonds of $170 million for which we have entered into currency swaps.  Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our leverage.  We believe the most comparable measure to Net Debt is debt net of cash and cash equivalents.  Our Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.6 as of December 31, 2020.\n43\nConsolidated Earnings Results (GAAP)\nThe following tables summarize the key components of our consolidated earnings results.\n(a)\nIncludes revenues, earnings from equity investments, and other, net, less operating expenses, loss (gain) on impairments and divestitures, net, and other income, net.  Operating expenses include costs of sales, operations and maintenance expenses, and taxes, other than income taxes.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019\nNet income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. decreased $2,071 million in 2020 compared to 2019.  The decrease was due primarily to $1,950 million of non-cash impairments of goodwill associated with our Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated and CO\n2\nreporting units and non-cash impairments of certain oil and gas producing assets in our CO\n2\nbusiness segment.  The decrease in results was further impacted by lower earnings from all of our business segments primarily attributable to COVID-19-related reduced energy demand and commodity price impacts and the impact of the KML and U.S. Cochin Sale in the fourth quarter of 2019 on our Natural Gas Pipelines and Terminals business segments, partially offset by the benefit of completed expansion projects in our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment, by lower interest expense and DD&A expense, and by lower income tax expense due to 2019 income taxes related to the KML and U.S. Cochin Sale.\n44\nCertain Items Affecting Consolidated Earnings Results\n(a)\nFor a more detailed discussion of these Certain Items, see the footnotes to the tables within\n“—Segment Earnings Results” and “—DD&A, General and Administrative and Corporate Charges, Interest, net and Noncontrolling Interests”\nbelow.\n(b)\nThe combined net effect of the Certain Items represents the income tax provision on Certain Items plus discrete income tax items.\nNet income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. adjusted for Certain Items (Adjusted Earnings) decreased by $150 million from the prior year and was primarily due to lower earnings from all of our business segments primarily attributable to COVID-19-related reduced energy demand and commodity price impacts and the impact of the KML and U.S. Cochin Sale in the fourth quarter of 2019 on our Natural Gas Pipelines and Terminals business segments, partially offset by the benefit of completed expansion projects in our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment and by lower interest expense and DD&A expense.\n45\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. (GAAP) to Adjusted Earnings to DCF\nAdjusted Segment EBDA to Adjusted EBITDA to DCF\n(a)\nAmounts are adjusted for Certain Items.  See tables included in\n“—Reconciliation of Net Income (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA”\nand\n“—Supplemental Information”\nbelow.\n(b)\nIncludes DD&A or income tax expense, as applicable, from joint ventures.  2019 amounts are also net of DD&A or income tax expense attributable to KML noncontrolling interests.  See tables included in\n“—Supplemental Information”\nbelow.\n(c)\nIncludes cash taxes or sustaining capital expenditures, as applicable, from joint ventures.

These decreases were partially offset by higher equity earnings due to the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline being placed in service in September 2019.  Overall Midstream’s revenues decreased primarily due to lower commodity prices which was largely offset by corresponding decreases in costs of sales;\n•\nWest Region’s decrease of $47 million (4%) was primarily due to decreases in earnings from (i) Ruby Pipeline Company, L.L.C. due principally to credit losses and lost revenues resulting from two of its customers’ bankruptcies; (ii) CPGPL as a result of the expiration of one shipper’s contract; and (iii) EPNG driven by higher operating expenses; and\n•\nEast Region’s increase of $157 million (7%) was primarily due to increases in earnings from ELC and SLNG resulting from the liquefaction units of the Elba Liquefaction project gradually being placed into service in the later part of 2019 and through the first eight months of 2020, and increased equity earnings from NGPL primarily due to higher revenues.  These increases were partially offset by reduced contributions from TGP due to the impact of the FERC 501-G rate settlement on its revenues.\n50\nProducts Pipelines\nCertain Items affecting Segment EBDA\n(a)\nIncludes Certain Item amounts of $50 million and $33 million in the 2020 and 2019 periods, respectively.  2020 amount includes a $46 million unfavorable rate case reserve adjustment, a non-cash loss on impairment of our Belton Terminal of $21 million and a $17 million favorable adjustment for tax reserves, other than income taxes.  2019 amount primarily related to unfavorable adjustments of an environmental reserve and of tax reserves, other than income taxes.\nOther\n(b)\nJoint venture throughput is reported at our ownership share.\n(c)\nVolumes include ethanol pipeline volumes.\nBelow are the changes in Adjusted Segment EBDA between 2020 and 2019:\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 versus Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe changes in Segment EBDA for our Products Pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving Adjusted Segment EBDA in the comparable years of 2020 and 2019:\n•\nCrude and Condensate’s decrease of $119 million (25%) was primarily due to decreased earnings from Kinder Morgan Crude & Condensate Pipeline (KMCC) and the Bakken Crude assets.  KMCC’s decreased earnings were primarily due to lower volumes. The Bakken Crude assets decreased earnings were primarily driven by lower volumes and reduced\n51\nre-contracted rates on Double H pipeline. KMCC and Bakken Crude assets decreases were also impacted by unfavorable inventory valuation adjustments driven by declines in commodity prices during the first quarter 2020;\n•\nWest Coast Refined Products’ decrease of $63 million (12%) was due to decreased earnings on Pacific (SFPP) operations, Calnev Pipe Line LLC and West Coast terminals driven by lower service revenues as a result of a reduction in volumes due to COVID-19; and\n•\nSoutheast Refined Products’ decrease of $49 million (18%) was primarily due to decreased earnings from our South East Terminals and a decrease in equity earnings from PPL pipeline as a result of decreased services revenues driven by lower volumes and prices due to COVID-19, and lower earnings from our Transmix processing operations driven by unfavorable inventory adjustments resulting from commodity price declines during the first quarter 2020.\nTerminals\nCertain Items affecting Segment EBDA\n(a)\nIncludes Certain Item amounts of $(55) million and $(332) million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.  2020 amount related to a gain on sale of our Staten Island terminal and 2019 amount primarily related to a gain of $339 million on the sale of KML.\nOther\n(b)\nVolumes for assets sold are excluded for all periods presented.\n(c)\nThe ratio of our tankage capacity in service to tankage capacity available for service.\n52\nBelow are the changes in Adjusted Segment EBDA between 2020 and 2019:\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 versus Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe changes in Segment EBDA for our Terminals business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving Adjusted Segment EBDA in the comparable years of 2020 and 2019:\n•\nthe Sale of KML assets to Pembina on December 16, 2019, which accounted for the decreases on our Alberta Canada terminals and our West Coast terminals;\n•\ndecrease of $23 million (7%) from our Gulf Liquids terminals primarily driven by lower volumes and associated ancillary fees related to demand reduction attributable to COVID-19 as well as tanks being temporarily off-lease as they are transitioned to new customers following the termination of a major customer contract;\n•\ndecrease of $10 million (15%) from our Mid Atlantic terminals primarily due to lower coal volumes at our Pier IX facility driven by coal market weakness largely attributable to demand reduction associated with COVID-19; and\n•\ndecrease of $8 million (12%) from our Gulf Bulk terminals primarily due to decreased coal volumes and the impact of an expired contract in January 2020.\n53\nCO\n2\nCertain Items affecting Segment EBDA\n(a)\nIncludes Certain Item amounts of $944 million and $26 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.  2020 amount includes (i) a $600 million goodwill impairment on our CO\n2\nreporting unit and (ii) non-cash impairments of $350 million on our oil and gas producing assets.  2019 amount includes non-cash impairments of $75 million on our oil and gas producing assets and an increase in revenues of $49 million related to mark-to-market gains associated with derivative contracts used to hedge forecasted commodity sales.\nOther\n(b)\nNet of royalties and outside working interests.\nBelow are the changes in Adjusted Segment EBDA between 2020 and 2019:\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 versus Year Ended December 31, 2019\n54\nThe changes in Segment EBDA for our CO\n2\nbusiness segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving Adjusted Segment EBDA in the comparable years of 2020 and 2019:\n•\ndecrease of  $82 million (28%) from our Source and Transportation activities primarily due to a decrease of $103 million related to lower CO\n2\nsales volumes partially offset by lower operating expenses of $28 million; and\n•\nincrease of $27 million (6%) from our Oil and Gas Producing activities primarily due to (i) lower operating expenses of $69 million; and (ii) higher realized crude oil prices which increased revenues by $62 million, offset by (i) lower volumes which decreased revenues by $92 million; and (ii) lower NGL prices which decreased revenues by $24 million.\nWe believe that our existing hedge contracts in place within our CO\n2\nbusiness segment substantially mitigate commodity price sensitivities in the near-term and to lesser extent over the following few years from price exposure.  Below is a summary of our CO\n2\nbusiness segment hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\n(a)\nIncludes West Texas Intermediate hedges.\nDD&A, General and Administrative and Corporate Charges, Interest, net and Noncontrolling Interests\nCertain Items\n(a)\n2020 amount includes $52 million for restricted stock accelerated vesting and severance expense, $15 million related to costs incurred associated with COVID-19 mitigation and an increase in expense of $23 million associated with a non-cash fair value adjustment and the dividend on the Pembina common stock.  2019 amount includes: (i) an increase in asset sale related costs of $15 million; (ii) an increase in expense of $13 million related to a litigation matter; and (iii) a decrease in expense of $19 million associated with a non-cash fair value adjustment on the Pembina common stock.\n55\n(b)\nAmounts are adjusted for Certain Items.\n(c)\n2020 and 2019 amounts include: (i) decreases in interest expense of $21 million and $29 million, respectively, related to non-cash debt fair value adjustments associated with acquisitions and (ii) increases of $8 million and $13 million, respectively, in interest expense related to non-cash mismatches between the change in fair value of interest rate swaps and change in fair value of hedged debt.\nDD&A expense decreased $247 million in 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily due to larger non-cash impairments taken in the first quarter 2020 compared to the fourth quarter 2019 on our oil and gas producing assets, lower CO\n2\nbusiness segment oil and gas production and the sale of KML partially offset by our Elba Liquefaction project gradually placed into service during 2019 and 2020.\nGeneral and administrative expenses and corporate charges adjusted for Certain Items decreased $37 million in 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily due to lower non-cash pension expenses of $45 million, lower expenses of $31 million due to the KML and U.S. Cochin Sale and $20 million of cost savings associated with efficiency efforts and reduced activity during the pandemic, partially offset by lower capitalized costs of $57 million reflecting reduced capital projects primarily in our Natural Gas Pipelines, CO\n2\nand Products Pipelines business segments.\nIn the table above, we report our interest expense as “net,” meaning that we have subtracted interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount.  Our consolidated interest expense, net adjusted for Certain Items decreased $206 million in 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily due to lower weighted average long-term debt balances and lower LIBOR rates partially offset by lower capitalized interest.\nWe use interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long-term fixed rate debt securities (senior notes) into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 16% and 27%, respectively, of the principal amount of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates—either as short-term or long-term variable rate debt obligations or as fixed-rate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps.  For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 14 “\nRisk Management—Interest Rate Risk Management\n” to our consolidated financial statements.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests, represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not owned by us.  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests adjusted for Certain Items increased $8 million in 2020 compared to 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 versus Year Ended December 31, 2019\nOur income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 is approximately $481 million, as compared with income tax expense of $926 million for the same period of 2019.  The $445 million decrease in income tax expense in 2020 as compared to 2019 is due primarily to (i) lower pretax income in 2020, (ii) lower foreign income taxes as a result of the KML and U.S. Cochin Sale in 2019, and (iii) the refund of alternative minimum tax sequestration credits in 2020.  These decreases are partially offset by the lack of tax benefit on the higher impairment of non-tax deductible goodwill in 2020 and lower dividend-received deductions related to our investment in NGPL in 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1,184 million of “Cash and cash equivalents,” an increase of $999 million from December 31, 2019.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we had borrowing capacity of approximately $3.9 billion under our $4 billion revolving credit facility (discussed below in “\n—Short-term Liquidity\n”).  As discussed further below, we believe our cash flows from operating activities, cash position and remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facility are more than adequate to allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements and anticipated obligations.\nWe have consistently generated substantial cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds of $4,550 million and $4,748 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The year-to-year decrease is discussed below in “\n—Cash Flows—Operating Activities.\n”  We primarily rely on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt service, sustaining capital expenditures, dividend payments, and our growth capital expenditures. We believe our current cash on hand, our cash from operations and our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility are more than adequate to allow us to manage\n56\nour cash requirements, including maturing debt, through 2021; however, we may access the debt capital markets from time to time to refinance our maturing long-term debt.\nOur board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.2625 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020, consistent with previous quarters in 2020.  The total of the dividends declared for 2020 of $1.05 represents a 5% increase over total dividends declared for 2019.  We expect to fully fund our dividend payments as well as our discretionary spending for 2021 without funding from the capital markets with additional flexibility to engage in share repurchases on an opportunistic basis.\nShort-term Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of short-term liquidity are (i) cash from operations; (ii) our $4.0 billion revolving credit facility and associated commercial paper program; and (iii) cash and cash equivalents.  The loan commitments under our revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, and as a backup to our commercial paper program.  Letters of credit and commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings allowed under our credit facility.  We provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility and, as previously discussed, have consistently generated strong cash flows from operations.  We do not anticipate any significant limitations from the continuing impacts of COVID-19 with respect to our ability to access funding through our credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our $2,558 million of short-term debt consisted primarily of senior notes that mature in the next twelve months.  We intend to fund our debt, as it becomes due, primarily through credit facility borrowings, commercial paper borrowings, cash flows from operations, and/or issuing new long-term debt.  Our short-term debt balance as of December 31, 2019 was $2,477 million.\nWe had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) deficits of $1,871 million and $1,862 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  From time to time, our current liabilities may include short-term borrowings used to finance our expansion capital expenditures, which we may periodically replace with long-term financing and/or pay down using retained cash from operations.  The overall slight $9 million unfavorable change from year-end 2019 was primarily due to: (i) a decrease of $925 million related to the sale of Pembina common equity in January 2020; (ii) an increase of approximately $216 million in senior notes that mature in the next twelve months; and (iii) the $100 million repayment of the preferred interest in Kinder Morgan G.P. Inc.; substantially offset by (i) an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $999 million; and (ii) a favorable asset fair value adjustment of $101 million on derivative contracts in 2020.  Generally, our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments, timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables, the change in fair value of our derivative contracts, and changes in our cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities (discussed below in “\n—Long-term Financing\n” and “\n—Capital Expenditures\n”).\nWe employ a centralized cash management program for our U.S.-based bank accounts that concentrates the cash assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing.  These programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of our wholly owned subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the consolidated group.  We place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities, payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to KMI other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities.\nCertain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to FERC-enacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs.  FERC-regulated entities subject to these rules must, among other things, place their cash management agreements in writing, maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements, and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the FERC.\nCredit Ratings and Capital Market Liquidity\nWe believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives.  We expect that our short-term liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations or short-term borrowings.  Generally, we anticipate re-financing maturing long-term debt obligations in the debt capital markets and are therefore subject to certain market conditions which could result in higher costs or negatively affect our and/or our subsidiaries’ credit ratings.  A decrease in our credit ratings could negatively impact our borrowing costs and could limit our access to capital, including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar terms, which could in turn reduce our cash flows and limit our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities.\n57\nAs of December 31, 2020, our short-term corporate debt ratings were A-2, Prime-2 and F2 at Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Services and Fitch Ratings, Inc., respectively.\nThe following table represents KMI’s and KMP’s senior unsecured debt ratings as of December 31, 2020.\nLong-term Financing\nOur equity consists of Class P common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share.  We do not expect to need to access the equity capital markets to fund our discretionary capital investments for the foreseeable future.  See also “—\nDividends and Stock Buy-back Program\n” below for additional discussion related to our dividends and stock buy-back program.\nFrom time to time, we issue long-term debt securities, often referred to as senior notes.  All of our senior notes issued to date, other than those issued by certain of our subsidiaries, generally have very similar terms, except for interest rates, maturity dates and prepayment premiums.  All of our fixed rate senior notes provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date, and, in most cases, plus a make-whole premium.  In addition, from time to time, our subsidiaries issue long-term debt securities.  Furthermore, we and almost all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are parties to a cross guaranty wherein we each guarantee each other’s debt.  See “\n—Summarized Combined Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries\n. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our various long-term debt obligations (excluding current maturities) was $30,838 million and $30,883 million, respectively.\nOn August 5, 2020, we issued in a registered offering two series of senior notes consisting of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior notes due 2031 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior notes due 2050 and received combined net proceeds of $1,226 million.  We used the proceeds to repay maturing debt, including in early January 2021, our $750 million 3.50% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in March 2021.\nTo refinance construction costs of its recent expansions, on February 24, 2020, TGP, a wholly owned subsidiary, issued in a private placement $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.90% senior notes due 2030 and received net proceeds of $991 million.\nWe achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing long-term fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate interest payments and through the issuance of commercial paper or credit facility borrowings.\nFor additional information about our outstanding senior notes and debt-related transactions in 2020 , see Note 9\n“Debt”\nto our consolidated financial statements.  For information about our interest rate risk, see Item 7A “\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk.\n”\nCounterparty Creditworthiness\nSome of our customers or other counterparties may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness.  These financial problems may arise from our current global economic conditions, continued volatility of commodity prices or otherwise.  In such situations, we utilize, to the extent allowable under applicable contracts, tariffs and regulations, prepayments and other security requirements, such as letters of credit, to enhance our credit position relating to amounts owed from these counterparties.  While we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect against counterparty credit risk, we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our customers or other counterparties will not become financially distressed and will not default on their obligations to us.  The balance of our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, was $\n26\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion, respectively, reflected in “Other current assets” on our consolidated balance sheets, which includes reserves for counterparty bankruptcies recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n58\nCapital Expenditures\nWe account for our capital expenditures in accordance with GAAP. We also distinguish between capital expenditures that are maintenance/sustaining capital expenditures and those that are expansion capital expenditures (which we also refer to as discretionary capital expenditures).  Expansion capital expenditures are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement, and are not deducted in calculating DCF (see “\n—Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. (GAAP) to Adjusted Earnings to DCF\n”). With respect to our oil and gas producing activities, we classify a capital expenditure as an expansion capital expenditure if it is expected to increase capacity or throughput (i.e., production capacity) from the capacity or throughput immediately prior to the making or acquisition of such additions or improvements. Maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity.  The distinction between maintenance and expansion capital expenditures is a physical determination rather than an economic one, irrespective of the amount by which the throughput or capacity is increased.\nBudgeting of maintenance capital expenditures is done annually on a bottom-up basis.  For each of our assets, we budget for and make those maintenance capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations, meet customer needs and comply with our operating policies and applicable law.  We may budget for and make additional maintenance capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency and/or lowering future expenses. Budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures are generally made periodically throughout the year on a project-by-project basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures.  Generally, the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenance/sustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level.  The classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as maintenance capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process, but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion.  The classification has an impact on DCF because capital expenditures that are classified as expansion capital expenditures are not deducted from DCF, while those classified as maintenance capital expenditures are.\nOur capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the amount we expect to spend for 2021 to sustain our assets and grow our business are as follows:\n(a)\n2020 and Expected 2021 amounts include $114 million and $119 million, respectively, for sustaining capital expenditures from unconsolidated joint ventures, reduced by consolidated joint venture partners’ sustaining capital expenditures.  See table included in “\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures—Supplemental Information\n.”\n(b)\n2020 excludes $21 million due to decreases in accrued capital expenditures and contractor retainage and net changes in other.\n(c)\n2020 amount includes $550 million of our contributions to certain unconsolidated joint ventures for capital investments and small acquisitions.\n(d)\nAmounts include our actual or estimated contributions to certain unconsolidated joint ventures, net of actual or estimated contributions from certain partners in non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries for capital investments.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have invested in entities that are not consolidated in our financial statements.  For information on our obligations with respect to these investments, as well as our obligations with respect to related letters of credit, see Note 13\n“Commitments and Contingent Liabilities”\nto our consolidated financial statements.  Additional information regarding the nature and business purpose of our investments is included in Note 7\n“Investments”\nto our consolidated financial statements.\n59\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\n(a)\nSee Note 9\n“Debt”\nto our consolidated financial statements.\n(b)\nInterest payment obligations exclude adjustments for interest rate swap agreements and assume no change in variable interest rates from those in effect at December 31,2020.\n(c)\nRepresents commitments pursuant to the terms of operating lease agreements as of December 31, 2020.\n(d)\nRepresents the amount by which the benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets at year-end for pension and OPEB plans whose accumulated postretirement benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets. The payments by period include expected contributions in 2021 and estimated benefit payments for underfunded plans in the other years.\n(e)\nPrimarily represents transportation agreements of $279 million, NGL volume agreements of $208 million and storage agreements for capacity of $131 million.\n(f)\nPrimarily includes (i) rights-of-way obligations; and (ii) environmental liabilities related to sites that we own or have a contractual or legal obligation with a regulatory agency or property owner upon which we will\nperform remediation activities. These environmental liabilities are included within “Other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities and deferred credits” in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\n(g)\nThe $147 million in letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2020 consisted of the following (i) letters of credit totaling $46 million supporting our International Marine Terminals Partnership Plaquemines, Louisiana Port, Harbor, and Terminal Revenue Bonds; (ii) $46 million under seven letters of credit for insurance purposes; (iii) a $24 million letter of credit supporting our Kinder Morgan Operating LLC “B” tax-exempt bonds; and (iv) a combined $31 million in thirty letters of credit supporting environmental and other obligations of us and our subsidiaries.\n(h)\nRepresents commitments for the purchase of plant, property and equipment as of December 31, 2020.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $198 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:\n•\na $409 million decrease in cash after adjusting the $2,059 million decrease in net income by $1,650 million for the combined effects of the period-to-period net changes in non-cash items including the following: (i) loss on impairments and divestitures, net (see discussion above in “—Results of Operations”); (ii) changes in fair market value of derivative contracts; (iii) DD&A expenses (including amortization of excess cost of equity investments); (iv) deferred income taxes; and (v) earnings from equity investments; partially offset by\n•\na $145 million increase in cash primarily resulting from $227 million of net income tax payments in the 2020 period compared to $372 million of net income tax payments in the 2019 period, which in both periods were primarily for foreign income taxes associated with the sale of certain Canadian assets.  The income tax payments for the 2020 period are net of a $20 million refund related to alternative minimum tax sequestration credits; and\n•\na $66 million increase in cash associated with net changes in working capital items, other than income tax payments, and other non-current assets and liabilities. The increase was driven, among other things, primarily by a favorable change due to the timing of trade payables payments, and partially offset by higher pension plan contributions we made in the 2020 period compared to the 2019 period.\n60\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities decreased $803 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:\n◦\na $959 million increase in cash from the proceeds received from the sales of property, plant and equipment, investments, and other net assets, net of removal costs primarily due to $907 million of proceeds received from the sale of the Pembina shares in the 2020 period.  See Note 4\n“Divestitures”\nto our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this transaction;\n◦\na $913 million decrease in cash used for contributions to equity investments driven by lower contributions to Gulf Coast Express Pipeline LLC, MEP, Citrus, and FEP in the 2020 period compared with the 2019 period, partially offset by contributions made to SNG in the 2020 period; and\n◦\na $563 million decrease in capital expenditures in the 2020 period over the comparative 2019 period primarily due to lower expenditures on the Elba Liquefaction expansion and also reflecting our reduction of expansion capital projects in the wake of COVID-19; partially offset by\n◦\nthe $1,527 million decrease in cash resulting from proceeds received from the KML and U.S. Cochin Sale, net of cash disposed, in 2019.  See Note 4\n“Divestitures”\nto our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this transaction; and\n◦\na $179 million decrease in distributions received from equity investments in excess of cumulative earnings primarily from Ruby, FEP and SNG in the 2020 period over the comparative 2019 period.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities decreased $3,547 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:\n•\na $3,065 million net increase in cash from net debt activity primarily driven by an increase in long-term debt issuances, and to a lesser extent, lower long-term debt repayments and lower utilization of our credit facility for short-term borrowings, which resulted in a substantial decrease in each our total debt issuances and total debt payments, in the 2020 period compared to the 2019 period.  See Note 9 “Debt” to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt activity; and\n•\nan $879 million decrease in cash used resulting from the distribution of the TMPL sale proceeds to the owners of KML restricted voting shares in the 2019 period; partially offset by\n•\na $199 million increase in dividend payments to our common shareholders; and\n•\na $137 million decrease in contributions received from an investment partner and noncontrolling interests primarily driven by lower contributions received from EIG in the 2020 period compared to the 2019 period.\nDividends and Stock Buy-back Program\nThe table below reflects the declaration of common stock dividends of $1.05 per common share for 2020:\nWe expect to continue to return additional value to our shareholders in 2021 through our previously announced dividend increase.  We plan to increase our dividend by 3% to $1.08 per common share in 2021.  Based on our 2021 expectations, we also expect to have the capacity to engage in opportunistic share repurchases up to $450 million during the year under our $2 billion common share buy-back program approved by our board of directors in July 2017.  Since December 2017, in total, we have repurchased approximately 32 million of our Class P shares under the program at an average price of approximately $17.71 per share for approximately $575 million.  For information on our equity buy-back program and our equity distribution agreement, see Note 11\n“Stockholders' Equity”\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nThe actual amount of common stock dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, liquidity requirements, business prospects, capital requirements, legal, regulatory and contractual constraints, tax laws, Delaware laws and other factors.  See Item 1A “\nRisk Factors—The guidance we provide\n61\nfor our anticipated dividends is based on estimates.  Circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business.”\nAll of these matters will be taken into consideration by our board of directors in declaring dividends.\nOur common stock dividends are not cumulative.  Consequently, if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels, our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future.  Our common stock dividends generally will be paid on or about the 15th day of each February, May, August and November.\nSummarized Combined Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries\nKMI and certain subsidiaries (Subsidiary Issuers) are issuers of certain debt securities.  KMI and substantially all of KMI’s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (Subsidiary Guarantors), are parties to a cross guarantee agreement whereby each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally, the payment of specified indebtedness of each other party to the agreement.  Accordingly, with the exception of certain subsidiaries identified as Subsidiary Non-Guarantors, the parent issuer, subsidiary issuers and Subsidiary Guarantors (the “Obligated Group”) are all guarantors of each series of our guaranteed debt (Guaranteed Notes).  As a result of the cross guarantee agreement, a holder of any of the Guaranteed Notes issued by KMI or subsidiary issuers are in the same position with respect to the net assets, and income of KMI and the Subsidiary Issuers and Guarantors.  The only amounts that are not available to the holders of each of the Guaranteed Notes to satisfy the repayment of such securities are the net assets, and income of the Subsidiary Non-Guarantors.\nIn lieu of providing separate financial statements for subsidiary issuers and guarantors, we have presented the accompanying supplemental summarized combined income statement and balance sheet information for the Obligated Group based on Rule 13-01 of the SEC’s Regulation S-X that we early adopted effective January 1, 2020.  Also, see Exhibit 10.14 to this Report “\nCross Guarantee Agreement, dated as of November 26, 2014, among KMI and certain of its subsidiaries, with schedules updated as of December 31, 2020.\n”\nAll significant intercompany items among the Obligated Group have been eliminated in the supplemental summarized combined financial information. The Obligated Group’s investment balances in Subsidiary Non-guarantors have been excluded from the supplemental summarized combined financial information. Significant intercompany balances and activity for the Obligated Group with other related parties, including Subsidiary Non-Guarantors, (referred to as “affiliates”) are presented separately in the accompanying supplemental summarized combined financial information.\nExcluding fair value adjustments, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Obligated Group had $32,563 million and $32,409 million, respectively, of Guaranteed Notes outstanding.\nSummarized combined balance sheet and income statement information for the Obligated Group follows:\n62\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 19\n“Recent Accounting Pronouncements”\nto our consolidated financial statements for information concerning recent accounting pronouncements."

    "text": "Generally, our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading.”  Our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward-looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates.  Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur, since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions.\nEnergy Commodity Market Risk\nWe are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business.  However, we manage these risks by executing a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses.  Our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of crude oil, natural gas and NGL.  The derivative contracts that we use include exchange-traded and OTC commodity financial instruments, including, but not limited to, futures and options contracts, fixed price swaps and basis swaps.  We may categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but which value is uncertain.\nOur hedging strategy involves entering into a financial position intended to offset our physical position, or anticipated position, in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change.  For example, as sellers of crude oil, natural gas and NGL, we often enter into fixed price swaps and/or futures contracts to guarantee or lock-in the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery, thereby in whole or in part offsetting any change in prices, either positive or negative.  Using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows which helps us to undertake further capital improvement projects, attain budget results and meet dividend targets.\nOur policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors, and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings.  While it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings, it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future.\nThe credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts (based on contract market values) are as follows (credit ratings per Standard & Poor’s Rating Service):\n63\nWe measure the risk of price changes in the derivative instrument portfolios utilizing a sensitivity analysis model.  The sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss (i.e., the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio) based upon a hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying quoted market prices.  In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values. Because we enter into derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities, both in the sensitivity analysis model and in reality, the change in the market value of the derivative contracts’ portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions. A hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying commodity prices would have the following effect on the associated derivative contracts’ estimated fair value:\nOur sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on the crude oil, natural gas and NGL portfolios of derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur.  It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated.  Actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures and the timing thereof, as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year.\nInterest Rate Risk\nIn order to maintain a cost effective capital structure, it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt.  The market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below.\nFor fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows.  Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows.  Generally, there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt. We are generally subject to interest rate risk upon refinancing maturing debt.  Below are our debt balances, including debt fair value adjustments and, as of December 31, 2019, the preferred interest in KMP held by KMGP that was redeemed on January 15, 2020, and sensitivity to interest rates:\n(a)\nA hypothetical 10% change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, would result in changes of approximately $1,541 million and $1,548 million, respectively, in the estimated fair values of these instruments.\n(b)\nDecember 31, 2020 amount includes $2.5 billion of variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements that expire during 2021.\n(c)\nDecember 31, 2020 amount includes $900 million of fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements that expire during 2021.\n64\n(d)\nA hypothetical 10% change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings (approximately 49 and 53 basis points, respectively, in 2020 and 2019) when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, including adjustments for the notional swap amounts described above, would result in changes of approximately $25 million and $47 million, respectively, in our 2020 and 2019 annual income before income taxes.\n(e)\nFair values were determined using Level 2 inputs.\nFixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of converting a portion of the underlying cash flows related to long-term fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt.  Since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest, swap agreements are entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest.  Such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest, and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to market rate changes.\nAs presented in the table above, we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time, may alter that mix by, for example, refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt (or vice versa) or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements.  As of December 31, 2020, including debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps but excluding our debt fair value adjustments, approximately 16% of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates.\nFor more information on our interest rate risk management and on our interest rate swap agreements, see Note 14\n“Risk Management”\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nLIBOR Phase Out\nAmounts drawn under our revolving credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to U.S. Dollar LIBOR (“USD LIBOR”), depending on our selection of repayment options, and certain of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements have a floating interest rate in relation to one-month LIBOR or three-month LIBOR.  In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. announced a desire to phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021.  The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee consisting of large U.S. financial institutions convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has recommended replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), an index supported by short-term Treasury repurchase agreements.  On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (“IBA”), the administrator of USD LIBOR announced that it does not intend to cease publication of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023, providing additional time for existing contracts that are dependent on LIBOR to mature.\nThe agreement governing our revolving credit facility includes provisions to determine a replacement rate for LIBOR if necessary during its term, which require that we and our administrative agent agree upon a replacement rate based on the then-prevailing market convention for similar agreements, which rate is not objected to by lenders holding a majority of the revolving commitments.  The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has developed provisions for SOFR-based fall-back rates to apply upon permanent cessation of LIBOR and has published a protocol to enable market participants to include the new provisions in existing swap agreements.\nWe currently do not expect the transition from LIBOR to have a material impact on us.\nForeign Currency Risk\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a notional principal amount of $1,358 million of cross-currency swap agreements that effectively convert all of our fixed-rate Euro denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to U.S. dollar denominated debt at fixed rates.  These swaps eliminate the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt."

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY QUARTERLY DATA\n72\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders of Kinder Morgan, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kinder Morgan, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nand the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019\n,\nand the results of its\noperations and its\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n73\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment of Certain Oil and Gas Producing Properties\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized $350 million of impairments on the income statement within “Loss (gain) on impairments and divestitures, net” for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to certain oil and gas producing properties included on the balance sheet under “Property, plant and equipment, net.”  Management accounts for their oil and gas producing properties under the successful efforts method of accounting and evaluates such properties for impairment of value on a field-by-field basis or, in certain instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure. Oil and gas producing properties deemed to be impaired are written down to their fair value, as determined by discounted future cash flows based on future oil and gas production volumes. To compute estimated future cash flows for oil and gas producing properties, management used reserve engineers (“specialists”) to estimate future oil and gas production volumes. These estimates of future oil and gas production volumes are based upon historical performance along with adjustments for expected crude oil and natural gas field development.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment of certain oil and gas producing properties that were impaired is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of specialists, when developing the fair value of the oil and gas producing properties; which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence related to the data, methods, and significant assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of future oil and gas production volumes.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s impairment assessment of oil and gas producing properties, including management’s estimates of future oil and gas production volumes. The work of management’s specialist was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the future oil and gas production volumes. As a basis for using this work, the specialists’ qualifications were understood and the Company’s relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of methods and assumptions used by the specialist, tests of the data used by the specialists, and an evaluation of the specialists’ findings.  These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for determining the fair value of the oil and gas producing properties; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s estimate of future oil and gas production volumes which involved considering the current and past performance of the oil and gas producing properties and whether this was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\nGoodwill Impairment of the CO\n2\nReporting Unit\nAs described in Notes 2, 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $19,851 million as of December 31, 2020, which included a $600 million impairment recorded on the CO\n2\nreporting unit within “Loss (gain) on impairments and divestitures, net” for the year ended December 31, 2020. Management evaluates goodwill for impairment on May 31 of each year, or more frequently to the extent events or conditions indicate a risk of possible impairment during the interim periods. Management estimates the fair value of the CO\n2\nreporting unit based on an income approach utilizing the present value of future cash flows from its oil and gas producing properties and source and transportation assets.  To compute estimated future cash flows for oil and gas producing properties, management used reserve engineers (“specialists”) to estimate future oil and gas production volumes. These estimates of future oil and gas production volumes are based upon historical performance along with adjustments for expected crude oil and natural gas field development. The future cash flows for the source and transportation assets are based on forecasted throughput volumes, CO\n2\npricing, operating expenses and capital expenditures.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment of the CO\n2\nreporting unit is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management, including the use of specialists, when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting unit, which included the  (i) estimates of the future oil and gas\n74\nproduction volumes of oil and gas producing properties; and (ii) the significant assumption related to the forecasted throughput volumes for the source and transportation assets; which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence related to (i) the data, methods, and significant assumption used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of future oil and gas production volumes of the oil and gas producing properties; and (ii) the significant assumption related to forecasted throughput volumes for the source and transportation assets.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessment. The work of management’s specialist was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the future oil and gas production volumes related to the oil and gas producing properties. As a basis for using this work, the specialists’ qualifications were understood and the Company’s relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used, tests of the data used by specialists, and an evaluation of the specialists’ findings. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the overall fair value estimate of the reporting unit, which includes the estimates of future oil and gas production volumes and the significant assumption related to the forecasted throughput volumes; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the estimate  of the future oil and gas production volumes and the significant assumption related to the forecasted throughput volumes. Evaluating management’s estimates and assumptions related to the future oil and gas production volumes and forecasted throughput volumes involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering the current and past performance of the oil and gas producing properties and the source and transportation assets and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\nGoodwill Impairment of the Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated Reporting Unit\nAs described in Notes 2, 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $19,851 million as of December 31, 2020, which included a $1,000 million impairment recorded on the Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated reporting unit within “Loss (gain) on impairments and divestitures, net” for the year ended December 31, 2020.  Management evaluates goodwill for impairment on May 31 of each year, or more frequently to the extent events or conditions indicate a risk of possible impairment during the interim periods. Management estimated the fair value of the Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated reporting unit utilizing a weighted average of a market approach (25%) and income approach (75%). The market approach was based on enterprise value to estimated 2020 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiples for a selected number of peer group midstream companies with comparable operations and economic characteristics. The income approach was based on an analysis of estimated discounted cash flows and an application of an exit multiple based on management’s expectations of a discount rate and exit multiple that would be applied by a theoretical market participant and for market transactions of comparable assets. The discounted cash flows included various assumptions on forecasted commodity throughput volumes and contract prices for each underlying asset within the reporting unit.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting unit utilizing the income approach; and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to  forecasted commodity throughput volumes and forecasted contract prices.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the forecasted commodity throughput volumes and forecasted contract prices. Evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to forecasted commodity throughput volumes and forecasted contract prices involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 5, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.\n75\nKINDER MORGAN, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe are one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America and unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “KMI” are intended to mean Kinder Morgan, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Our pipelines transport natural gas, refined petroleum products, crude oil, condensate, CO\n2\nand other products, and our terminals store and handle various commodities including gasoline, diesel fuel, chemicals, metals and petroleum coke.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur reporting currency is U.S. dollars, and all references to dollars are U.S. dollars, unless stated otherwise.  Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the rules and regulations of the SEC.  These rules and regulations conform to the accounting principles contained in the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the single source of GAAP.  Under such rules and regulations, all significant intercompany items have been eliminated in consolidation.  Additionally, certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic-related reduction in energy demand and the dramatic decline in commodity prices that began to impact us in the first quarter of 2020 has continued to cause disruptions and volatility.  Sharp declines in crude oil and natural gas production along with reduced demand for refined products due to the economic shutdown in the wake of the pandemic affected our business and continues to do so.  While we have seen some meaningful recovery during the second half of the year in demand for refined products that we move through our terminals, significant uncertainty remains regarding the duration and extent of the impact of the pandemic (including the timing and distribution of vaccines) on the energy industry, including demand and prices for the products handled by our pipelines, terminals, shipping vessels and other facilities.  These events, among other factors, resulted in certain non-cash impairments charges during 2020 as further discussed in Note 3.\nUse of Estimates\nCertain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared.  These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities, our revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and our disclosures, including as it relates to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements.  We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances.  Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.  Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nCertain accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others, and set out below are the principal accounting policies we apply in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nCash Equivalents and Restricted Deposits\nWe define cash equivalents as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nAmounts included in the restricted deposits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements represent a combination of restricted cash amounts required to be set aside by regulatory agencies to cover obligations for our captive insurance subsidiary and cash margin deposits posted by us with our counterparties associated with certain energy commodity contract positions.\n82\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nEffective with our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, “\nFinancial Instruments–Credit Losses\n” on January 1, 2020, we evaluate our financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures for expected credit losses over the contractual term of the asset or exposure.  We consider available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows including the expected risk of credit loss even if that risk is remote.  We measure expected credit losses on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist and we reflect the expected credit losses on the amortized cost basis of the financial asset as of the reporting date.\nOur financial instruments primarily consist of our accounts receivable from customers, notes receivable from affiliates, and contingent liabilities such as proportional guarantees of debt obligations of certain equity investees.  We utilized historical analysis of credit losses experienced over the previous five years along with current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions in our evaluation of collectability of our financial assets.  Our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020 includes an evaluation of estimated impacts resulting from the energy production and demand factors related to COVID-19 and the sharp decline in commodity prices, which we estimate could have a more significant impact to certain subset or pools of customers.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, generally our evaluation of appropriate reserves for our accounts receivable was based on a historical analysis of uncollected amounts and we recorded adjustments for changed circumstances and customer-specific information.\nOur allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $\n26\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion, respectively, included in “Other current assets” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nInventories\nOur inventories consist of materials and supplies and products such as NGL, crude oil, condensate, refined petroleum products, transmix and natural gas.  We report products inventory at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value. We report materials and supplies inventories at cost, and periodically review for physical deterioration and obsolescence.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\nCapitalization, Depreciation and Depletion and Disposals\nWe report property, plant and equipment at its acquisition cost.  We expense costs for routine maintenance and repairs in the period incurred.\nWe generally compute depreciation using either the straight-line method based on estimated economic lives or the composite depreciation method, which applies a single depreciation rate for a group of assets.  Generally, we apply composite depreciation rates to functional groups of property having similar economic characteristics.  The rates range from\n0.08\n% to\n33.3\n% excluding certain short-lived assets such as vehicles.  For FERC-regulated entities, the FERC-accepted composite depreciation rate is applied to the total cost of the composite group until the net book value equals the salvage value.  For other entities, depreciation estimates are based on various factors, including age (in the case of acquired assets), manufacturing specifications, technological advances, estimated production life of the oil or gas field served by the asset, contract term for assets on leased or customer property and historical data concerning useful lives of similar assets.  Uncertainties that impact these estimates include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration and abandonment requirements, economic conditions, and supply and demand in the area.  When these assets are put into service, we make estimates with respect to useful lives (and salvage values where appropriate) that we believe are reasonable.  Subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization expense.  Historically, adjustments to useful lives have not had a material impact on our aggregate depreciation levels from year to year.\nOur oil and gas producing activities are accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting.  Under this method, costs that are incurred to acquire leasehold and subsequent development costs are capitalized.  Costs that are associated with the drilling of successful exploration wells are capitalized if proved reserves are found.  Costs associated with the drilling of exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves, geological and geophysical costs, and costs of certain non-producing leasehold costs are expensed as incurred.  The capitalized costs of our producing oil and gas properties are depreciated and depleted by the units-of-production method.  Other miscellaneous property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the asset.\n83\nWe engage in enhanced recovery techniques in which CO\n2\nis injected into certain producing oil reservoirs.  In some cases, the cost of the CO\n2\nassociated with enhanced recovery is capitalized as part of our development costs when it is injected.  The cost of CO\n2\nassociated with pressure maintenance operations for reservoir management is expensed when it is injected.  When CO\n2\nis recovered in conjunction with oil production, it is extracted and re-injected, and all of the associated costs are expensed as incurred.  Proved developed reserves are used in computing units of production rates for drilling and development costs, and total proved reserves are used for depletion of leasehold costs.\nA gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment used in our oil and gas producing activities or in our liquids and bulk terminal activities is calculated as the difference between the cost of the asset disposed of, net of depreciation, and the sales proceeds received.  A gain on an asset disposal is recognized in income in the period that the sale is closed.  A loss on the sale of property, plant and equipment is calculated as the difference between the cost of the asset disposed of, net of depreciation, and the sales proceeds received or the market value if the asset is being held for sale.  A loss is recognized when the asset is sold or when the net cost of an asset held for sale is greater than the market value of the asset.  For our pipeline system assets under the composite method of depreciation, we generally charge the original cost of property sold or retired to accumulated depreciation and amortization, net of salvage and cost of removal.  Gains and losses are booked for FERC-approved operating unit sales and land sales and are recorded to income or expense accounts in accordance with regulatory accounting guidelines.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe record liabilities for obligations related to the retirement and removal of long-lived assets used in our businesses.  We record, as liabilities, the fair value of asset retirement obligations on a discounted basis when they are incurred and can be reasonably estimated, which is typically at the time the assets are installed or acquired.  Amounts recorded for the related assets are increased by the amount of these obligations.  Over time, the liabilities increase due to the change in their present value, and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.  The liabilities are eventually extinguished when the asset is taken out of service.\nWe have various other obligations throughout our businesses to remove facilities and equipment on rights-of-way and other leased facilities.  We currently cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these obligations because the associated assets have indeterminate lives.  These assets include pipelines, certain processing plants and distribution facilities, and certain liquids and bulk terminal facilities.  An asset retirement obligation, if any, will be recognized once sufficient information is available to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation.\nLong-lived Asset and Other Intangibles Impairments\nWe evaluate long-lived assets including leases and investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount of an asset or investment may not be recoverable.  We recognize impairment losses when estimated future cash flows expected to result from our use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount.\nIn addition to our annual goodwill impairment test, to the extent triggering events exist, we complete a review of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment as well as other intangibles, and record, as applicable, the appropriate impairments.  Because the impairment test for long-lived assets held in use is based on undiscounted cash flows, there may be instances where an asset or asset group is not considered impaired, even when its fair value may be less than its carrying value, because the asset or asset group is recoverable based on the cash flows to be generated over the estimated life of the asset or asset group.  If the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is in excess of undiscounted cash flows, we typically use discounted cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment is required.\nWe evaluate our oil and gas producing properties for impairment of value on a field-by-field basis or, in certain instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure, using undiscounted future cash flows based on estimated future oil and gas production volumes.\nOil and gas producing properties deemed to be impaired are written down to their fair value, as determined by discounted future cash flows based on estimated future oil and gas production volumes.  Unproved oil and gas properties that are individually significant are periodically assessed for impairment of value, and a loss is recognized at the time of impairment.\nRefer to Note 3 for further information.\n84\nEquity Method of Accounting and Basis Differences\nWe account for investments which we do not control, but do have the ability to exercise significant influence using the equity method of accounting.  The carrying values of these investments are impacted by our share of investee income or loss, distributions, amortization or accretion of basis differences and other-than-temporary impairments.\nThe difference between the carrying value of an investment and our share of the investment’s underlying equity in net assets is referred to as a basis difference.  If the basis difference is assigned to depreciable or amortizable assets and liabilities, the basis difference is amortized or accreted as part of our share of investee earnings.  To the extent that the basis difference relates to goodwill, referred to as equity method goodwill, the amount is not amortized.\nWe evaluate our equity method investments for other-than-temporary impairment.  When an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized the loss is recorded as a reduction in equity earnings.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the cost of an acquisition of a business in excess of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities and is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet.  Goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be tested for impairment at least annually and in interim periods if indicators of impairment exist.  This test requires us to assign goodwill to an appropriate reporting unit, and an impairment exists and is recorded for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on May 31 of each year.  For this purpose, we have\nsix\nreporting units as follows: (i) Products Pipelines (excluding associated terminals); (ii) Products Pipelines Terminals (evaluated separately from Products Pipelines for goodwill purposes); (iii) Natural Gas Pipelines Regulated; (iv) Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated; (v) CO\n2\n; and (vi) Terminals.  We also evaluate goodwill for impairment to the extent events or conditions change between annual tests that would indicate a risk of possible impairment at the interim period.  Generally, the evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves a quantitative test, although under certain circumstance an initial qualitative evaluation may be sufficient to conclude that goodwill is not impaired without conducting the quantitative test.\nPrior  to our adoption of ASU No. 2017-04, “\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic) 350:  Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\n” effective January 1, 2020, we performed a two-step quantitative test.  Step 1 involved the quantitative test still applied under ASU No. 2017-04 described above.  If the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value, the reporting unit’s goodwill was not considered impaired.  If the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value, step 2 was performed to determine whether goodwill was impaired and, if so, the amount of the impairment.  Step 2 involved calculating an implied fair value of goodwill by performing a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit determined in step 1 to the respective tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit.  The remaining implied goodwill was then compared to the actual carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit.  To the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the implied goodwill, the difference was the amount of the goodwill impairment.\nA large portion of our goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes, and as such, to the extent there are impairments, all or a portion of the impairment may not result in a corresponding tax benefit.\nRefer to Note 8 for further information.\nOther Intangibles\nExcluding goodwill, our other intangible assets include customer contracts, relationships and agreements, and technology-based assets.\nAs of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the gross carrying amounts of these intangible assets was $\n4,074\nmillion and  $\n4,126\nmillion, respectively, and the accumulated amortization was $\n1,621\nmillion and $\n1,450\nmillion, respectively, resulting in net carrying amounts of $\n2,453\nmillion and $\n2,676\nmillion, respectively. These intangible assets primarily consisted of customer contracts, relationships and agreements associated with our Natural Gas Pipelines and Product Pipelines business segments.\nPrimarily, these contracts, relationships and agreements relate to the gathering of natural gas, and the handling and storage of petroleum, chemical, and dry-bulk materials, including oil, gasoline and other refined petroleum products, petroleum coke, metals and ores.  We determined the values of these intangible assets by first, estimating the revenues derived from a customer contract or relationship (offset by the cost and expenses of supporting assets to fulfill the contract), and second, discounting the revenues at a risk adjusted discount rate.\n85\nWe amortize the costs of our intangible assets to expense in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives.  The life of each intangible asset is based either on the life of the corresponding customer contract or agreement or, in the case of a customer relationship intangible (the life of which was determined by an analysis of all available data on that business relationship), the length of time used in the discounted cash flow analysis to determine the value of the customer relationship.  Among the factors we weigh, depending on the nature of the asset, are the effect of obsolescence, new technology, and competition.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the amortization expense on our intangibles totaled $\n212\nmillion, $\n214\nmillion and $\n219\nmillion, respectively.  Our estimated amortization expense for our intangible assets for each of the next five fiscal years (2021 – 2025) is approximately $\n228\nmillion, $\n227\nmillion, $\n222\nmillion, $\n222\nmillion, and $\n216\nmillion, respectively.  As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average amortization period for our intangible assets was approximately\neleven years\n.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our revenues are accounted for under ASC 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n; however, to a limited extent, some revenues are accounted for under other guidance such as ASC 842,\nLeases\nor ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\n.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nWe review our contracts with customers using the following steps to recognize revenue based on the transfer of goods or services to customers and in amounts that reflect the consideration the company expects to receive for those goods or services.  The steps include:  (i) identify the contract; (ii) identify the performance obligations of the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and then (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.  Each of these steps involves management judgment and an analysis of the contract’s material terms and conditions.\nOur customer sales contracts primarily include natural gas sales, NGL sales, crude oil sales, CO\n2\nsales, and transmix sales contracts, as described below.  Generally, for the majority of these contracts: (i) each unit (Mcf, gallon, barrel, etc.) of commodity is a separate performance obligation, as our promise is to sell multiple distinct units of commodity at a point in time; (ii) the transaction price principally consists of variable consideration, which amount is determinable each month end based on our right to invoice at month end for the value of commodity sold to the customer that month; and (iii) the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the commodity’s standalone selling price and recognized as revenue upon delivery of the commodity, which is the point in time when the customer obtains control of the commodity and our performance obligation is satisfied.\nOur customer services contracts primarily include transportation service, storage service, gathering and processing service, and terminaling service contracts, as described below.  Generally, for the majority of these contracts: (i) our promise is to transfer (or stand ready to transfer) a series of distinct integrated services over a period of time, which is a single performance obligation; (ii) the transaction price includes fixed and/or variable consideration, which amount is determinable at contract inception and/or at each month end based on our right to invoice at month end for the value of services provided to the customer that month; and (iii) the transaction price is recognized as revenue over the service period specified in the contract (which can be a day, including each day in a series of promised daily services, a month, a year, or other time increment, including a deficiency makeup period) as the services are rendered using a time-based (passage of time) or units-based (units of service transferred) output method for measuring the transfer of control of the services and satisfaction of our performance obligation over the service period, based on the nature of the promised service (e.g., firm or non-firm) and the terms and conditions of the contract (e.g., contracts with or without makeup rights).\nFirm Services\nFirm services (also called uninterruptible services) are services that are promised to be available to the customer at all times during the period(s) covered by the contract, with limited exceptions.  Our firm service contracts are typically structured with take-or-pay or minimum volume provisions, which specify minimum service quantities a customer will pay for even if it chooses not to receive or use them in the specified service period (referred to as “deficiency quantities”).  We typically recognize the portion of the transaction price associated with such provisions, including any deficiency quantities, as revenue depending on whether the contract prohibits the customer from making up deficiency quantities in subsequent periods, or the contract permits this practice, as follows:\n86\n•\nContracts without Makeup Rights.\nIf contractually the customer cannot make up deficiency quantities in future periods, our performance obligation is satisfied, and revenue associated with any deficiency quantities is generally recognized as each service period expires.  Because a service period may exceed a reporting period, we determine at inception of the contract and at the beginning of each subsequent reporting period if we expect the customer to take the minimum volume associated with the service period.  If we expect the customer to make up all deficiencies in the specified service period (i.e., we expect the customer to take the minimum service quantities), the minimum volume provision is deemed not substantive and we will recognize the transaction price as revenue in the specified service period as the promised units of service are transferred to the customer.  Alternatively, if we expect that there will be any deficiency quantities that the customer cannot or will not make up in the specified service period (referred to as “breakage”), we will recognize the estimated breakage amount (subject to the constraint on variable consideration) as revenue ratably over such service period in proportion to the revenue that we will recognize for actual units of service transferred to the customer in the service period.  For certain take-or-pay contracts where we make the service, or a part of the service (e.g., reservation) continuously available over the service period, we typically recognize the take-or-pay amount as revenue ratably over such period based on the passage of time.\n•\nContracts with Makeup Rights.\nIf contractually the customer can acquire the promised service in a future period and make up the deficiency quantities in such future period (the “deficiency makeup period”), we have a performance obligation to deliver those services at the customer’s request (subject to contractual and/or capacity constraints) in the deficiency makeup period.  At inception of the contract, and at the beginning of each subsequent reporting period, we estimate if we expect that there will be deficiency quantities that the customer will or will not make up.  If we expect the customer will make up all deficiencies it is contractually entitled to, any non-refundable consideration received relating to temporary deficiencies that will be made up in the deficiency makeup period will be deferred as a contract liability, and we will recognize that amount as revenue in the deficiency makeup period when either of the following occurs: (i) the customer makes up the volumes or (ii) the likelihood that the customer will exercise its right for deficiency volumes then becomes remote (e.g., there is insufficient capacity to make up the volumes, the deficiency makeup period expires).  Alternatively, if we expect at inception of the contract, or at the beginning of any subsequent reporting period, that there will be any deficiency quantities that the customer cannot or will not make up (i.e., breakage), we will recognize the estimated breakage amount (subject to the constraint on variable consideration) as revenue ratably over the specified service periods in proportion to the revenue that we will recognize for actual units of service transferred to the customer in those service periods.\nNon-Firm Services\nNon-firm services (also called interruptible services) are the opposite of firm services in that such services are provided to a customer on an “as available” basis.  Generally, we do not have an obligation to perform these services until we accept a customer’s periodic request for service.  For the majority of our non-firm service contracts, the customer will pay only for the actual quantities of services it chooses to receive or use, and we typically recognize the transaction price as revenue as those units of service are transferred to the customer in the specified service period (typically a daily or monthly period).\nContract Balances\nContract assets and contract liabilities are the result of timing differences between revenue recognition, billings and cash collections.  We recognize contract assets in those instances where billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, and our right to invoice the customer is conditioned on something other than the passage of time.  Our contract assets are substantially related to breakage revenue associated with our firm service contracts with minimum volume commitment payment obligations and contracts where we apply revenue levelization (i.e., contracts with fixed rates per volume that increase over the life of the contract for which we record revenue ratably per unit over the life of the contract based on our performance obligations that are generally unchanged over the life of the contract).  Our contract liabilities are substantially related to (i) capital improvements paid for in advance by certain customers generally in our non-regulated businesses, which we subsequently recognize as revenue on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the related customer contracts; (ii) consideration received from customers for temporary deficiency quantities under minimum volume contracts that we expect will be made up in a future period, which we subsequently recognize as revenue when the customer makes up the volumes or the likelihood that the customer will exercise its right for deficiency volumes becomes remote (e.g., there is insufficient capacity to make up the volumes, the deficiency makeup period expires); and (iii) contracts with fixed rates per volume that decrease over the life of the contract where we apply revenue levelization for amounts received for our future performance obligations.  We reassess amounts recorded as contract assets or liabilities upon contract modification.\nRefer to Note 15 for further information.\n87\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales primarily includes the cost to purchase energy commodities sold, including natural gas, crude oil, NGL and other refined petroleum products, adjusted for the effects of our energy commodity hedging activities, as applicable.  Costs of our crude oil, gas and CO\n2\nproducing activities, such as those in our CO\n2\nbusiness segment, are not accounted for as costs of sales.\nOperations and Maintenance\nOperations and maintenance include costs of services and is primarily comprised of (i) operational labor costs and (ii) operations, maintenance and asset integrity, regulatory and environmental costs. Costs associated with our crude oil, gas and CO\n2\nproducing activities included within operations and maintenance totaled $\n319\nmillion, $\n382\nmillion and $\n363\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe capitalize or expense, as appropriate, environmental expenditures.  We capitalize certain environmental expenditures required to obtain rights-of-way, regulatory approvals or permitting as part of the construction of facilities we use in our business operations.  We accrue and expense environmental costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation.  We generally do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value, and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs.  Generally, our accrual of these environmental liabilities coincides with either our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action.  We recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable.  We record at estimated fair value, where appropriate, environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nWe routinely conduct reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations.  These reviews assist us in identifying environmental issues and estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts.  We also routinely adjust our environmental liabilities to reflect changes in previous estimates.  In making environmental liability estimations, we consider the material effect of environmental compliance, pending legal actions against us, and potential third-party liability claims we may have against others.  Often, as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses, additional information is obtained, requiring revisions to estimated costs.  These revisions are reflected in our income in the period in which they are reasonably determinable.\nLeases\nLessee\nWe lease property including corporate and field offices and facilities, vehicles, heavy work equipment including rail cars and large trucks, tanks, office equipment and land.  Our leases have remaining lease terms of\none\nto\n50\nyears, some of which have options to extend or terminate the lease.  We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception or upon modification.  For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nBeginning January 1, 2019, operating ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date.  Operating leases in effect prior to January 1, 2019 were recognized at the present value of the remaining payments on the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019.  Leases with variable rate adjustments, such as Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustments, were reflected based on contractual lease payments as outlined within the lease agreement and exclude CPI adjustments.  Because most of our leases do not provide an explicit rate of return, we use our incremental secured borrowing rate based on lease term information available at the commencement date of the lease in determining the present value of lease payments. We have real estate lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately, while for the remainder of our agreements we have elected the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.  For certain equipment leases, such as copiers and vehicles, we account for the leases under a portfolio method.  Leases that were grandfathered under various portions of Topic 842, such as land easements, are reassessed when agreements are modified.\nRefer to Note 17 for further information.\n88\nShare-based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of the restricted stock award based on the grant-date fair value, which is determined based on the market price of our common units on the grant date, less estimated forfeitures.  Forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical forfeitures under our restricted stock award plans.  Upon vesting, the restricted stock award will be paid in our Class P common shares.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe recognize the differences between the fair value of each of our and our consolidated subsidiaries’ pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets and the benefit obligations as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.  We record deferred plan costs and income—unrecognized losses and gains, unrecognized prior service costs and credits, and any remaining unamortized transition obligations—net of income taxes in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” with the proportionate share associated with less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries allocated and included within “Noncontrolling interests,” or as a regulatory asset or liability for certain of our regulated operations, until they are amortized as a component of benefit expense.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nWe capitalize financing costs incurred with new borrowings and amortize the costs over the contractual term of the related obligations.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest represents the interest in one of our consolidated subsidiaries, ELC, that is not owned by us, which in certain limited circumstances, the partner has the right to relinquish its interest in the subsidiary and redeem its cumulative contributions, net of distributions it has received through date of redemption. Distributions paid to ELC are recorded as a reduction to the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest balance\n.\nNet income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest was $\n54\nmillion, $\n11\nmillion and less than $\n1\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and is reported in “Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests” in our accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represents the interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not owned by us.  In our accompanying consolidated income statements, the noncontrolling interest in the net income of our less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries is shown as an allocation of our consolidated net income and is presented separately as “Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.”  In our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, noncontrolling interests is presented separately as “Noncontrolling interests” within “Stockholders’ Equity.”\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense is recorded based on an estimate of the effective tax rate in effect or to be in effect during the relevant periods. Changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations in the period in which such changes are enacted. We do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed. Therefore, we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate. Changes in our effective rate, including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes, are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount that is, more likely than not, to not be realized. While we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance, any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached.\nIn determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments, we apply an accounting policy that looks through our investments. The application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the non-tax-deductible goodwill portion of our investments, including KMI’s investment in its wholly-owned subsidiary, KMP.\n89\nRisk Management Activities\nWe utilize energy commodity derivative contracts for the purpose of mitigating our risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of commodities including crude oil, natural gas, and NGL.  In addition, we enter into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk associated with our debt obligations.  We also enter into cross-currency swap agreements to manage our foreign currency risk with certain debt obligations, and prior to the divestitures of our Canadian assets, our net investments in foreign operations.  We measure our derivative contracts at fair value and we report them on our balance sheet as either an asset or liability.  For certain physical forward commodity derivatives contracts, we apply the normal purchase/normal sale exception, whereby the revenues and expenses associated with such transactions are recognized during the period when the commodities are physically delivered or received.\nFor qualifying accounting hedges, we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objectives, and the methods used for assessing and testing effectiveness.  When we designate a derivative contract as a cash flow accounting hedge, the entire change in fair value of the derivative that is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is deferred in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” and reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings.  When we designate a derivative contract as a fair value accounting hedge, the entire change in fair value of the derivative is recorded as an adjustment to the item being hedged. The gain or loss from any mismatch in the hedging relationship is recognized currently in earnings.  When we designate a derivative contract as a net investment accounting hedge, the entire change in fair value of the derivative is reflected in the Foreign currency translation adjustments section of Other comprehensive (loss) income on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges, or for which we have not elected the normal purchase/normal sales exception, changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings.\nFair Value\nThe fair values of our financial instruments are separated into three broad levels (Levels 1, 2 and 3) based on our assessment of the availability of observable market data and the significance of non-observable data used to determine fair value.  We assign each fair value measurement to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Recognized valuation techniques utilize inputs such as contractual prices, quoted market prices or rates, and discount factors.  These inputs may be either readily observable or corroborated by market data.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nRegulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues or expenses associated with certain charges and credits that will be recovered from or returned to customers through the ratemaking process.  In instances where we receive recovery in tariff rates related to losses on dispositions of operating units, we record a regulatory asset for the estimated recoverable amount.  We include the amounts of our regulatory assets and liabilities within “Other current assets,” “Deferred charges and other assets,” “Other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities and deferred credits,” respectively, in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table summarizes our regulatory asset and liability balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(a)\nRegulatory assets as of December 31, 2020 include (i) $\n131\nmillion of unamortized losses on disposal of assets; (ii) $\n49\nmillion income tax gross up on equity AFUDC; and (iii) $\n76\nmillion of other assets including amounts related to fuel tracker arrangements.  Approximately $\n119\nmillion of the regulatory assets, with a weighted average remaining recovery period of\n14\nyears, are recoverable\n90\nwithout earning a return, including the income tax gross up on equity AFUDC for which there is an offsetting deferred income tax balance for FERC rate base purposes; therefore, it does not earn a return.\n(b)\nRegulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2020 are comprised of customer prepayments to be credited to shippers or other over-collections that are expected to be returned to shippers or netted against under-collections over time.  Approximately $\n112\nmillion of the $\n169\nmillion classified as non-current is expected to be credited to shippers over a remaining weighted average period of\n17\nyears, while the remaining $\n57\nmillion is not subject to a defined period.\nEarnings per Share\nWe calculate earnings per share using the two-class method.  Earnings were allocated to Class P shares and participating securities based on the amount of dividends paid in the current period plus an allocation of the undistributed earnings or excess distributions over earnings to the extent that each security participates in earnings or excess distributions over earnings.  Our unvested restricted stock awards, which may be restricted stock or restricted stock units issued to employees and non-employee directors and include dividend equivalent payments, do not participate in excess distributions over earnings.\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of net income available to shareholders of Class P shares and participating securities:\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were approximately\n13\nmillion  restricted stock awards outstanding.\nThe following maximum number of potential common stock equivalents are antidilutive and, accordingly, are excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per share:\n(a)\nThe holder of each convertible preferred share participated in our earnings by receiving preferred stock dividends through the mandatory conversion date of October 26, 2018 at which time our convertible preferred shares were converted to common shares.\n3.  Impairments and Losses and Gains on Divestitures\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recorded net pre-tax losses of $\n1,922\nmillion, gains of $\n285\nmillion and losses of $\n437\nmillion, respectively, reflecting net losses on impairments of goodwill, long-lived assets, intangible and other assets and certain equity investments, and net losses and gains on divestitures of assets and equity investments.  The year ended December 31, 2020 amount primarily includes pre-tax goodwill and long-lived and intangible asset impairment losses of $\n1,600\nmillion and $\n376\nmillion, respectively, and the year ended December 31, 2019 amount primarily includes a net pre-tax gain of $\n1,296\nmillion related to the KML and U.S. Cochin Sale (see Note 4) and impairment losses of $\n1,014\nmillion as further described below.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the energy production and demand factors related to COVID-19 and the sharp decline in commodity prices represented a triggering event that required us to perform impairment testing on certain businesses that are sensitive to commodity prices.  As a result, we performed an impairment analysis of long-lived assets within our CO\n2\nbusiness segment and conducted interim tests of the recoverability of goodwill for our CO\n2\nand Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated\n91\nreporting units as of March 31, 2020, which resulted in impairments of $\n350\nmillion on long-lived assets and $\n600\nmillion on goodwill within our CO\n2\nbusiness segment during the three months ended March 31, 2020.\nAdditionally, we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of May 31, 2020.  For our Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated reporting unit, while no goodwill impairment was required as of March 31, 2020, the additional market and economic indicators existing at May 31, 2020, as further described below, resulted in the recognition of a goodwill impairment for that reporting unit during the three months ended June 30, 2020.\nWe recognized the following non-cash pre-tax losses (gains) on impairments and divestitures on assets and equity investments during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(a)\n2020 amounts represent non-cash goodwill impairments associated with our Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated and CO\n2\nreporting units (see “—\nGoodwill Impairments\n” below).\n(b)\n2019 amount represents non-cash impairments associated with certain gathering and processing assets in Oklahoma and northern Texas.  2018 amount represents non-cash impairment associated with certain gathering and processing assets in Oklahoma and a project write-off associated with the Utica Marcellus Texas pipeline.\n(c)\n2019 amount includes a $\n957\nmillion gain related to the sale of the Cochin Pipeline system.\n(d)\nNon-cash impairments of equity investments are included in “Earnings from equity investments” on our accompanying consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.  2019 amount represents the non-cash impairment of our investment in Ruby.  2018 amount represents the non-cash impairment of our investment in Gulf LNG Holdings Group, LLC (Gulf LNG) which was driven by a ruling by an arbitration panel affecting a customer contract.  Our share of earnings recognized by Gulf LNG on the respective customer contract is included in “Earnings from equity investments” on our accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(e)\n2018 amount primarily relates to non-cash impairments of certain northeast terminal assets.\n(f)\n2020 amount includes a $\n55\nmillion gain related to the sale of our Staten Island terminal.  2019 amount includes a $\n339\nmillion gain related to the sale of KML.\n(g)\n2020, 2019 and 2018 amounts represent impairments of oil and gas properties.\n(h)\n2019 and 2018 amounts represent a working capital adjustment and gain on sale, respectively, associated with the TMPL Sale.\n92\nLong-lived Assets\nAs of March 31, 2020, for our CO\n2\nassets, the long-lived asset impairment test involved an assessment as to whether each asset’s net book value is expected to be recovered from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows.\n•\nTo compute estimated future cash flows for our oil and gas producing properties, we used our reserve engineer specialists to estimate future oil and gas production volumes.  These estimates of future oil and gas production volumes are based upon historical performance along with adjustments for expected crude oil and natural gas field development.  In calculating future cash flows, management utilized estimates of commodity prices based on a March 31, 2020 NYMEX forward curve adjusted for the impact of our existing sales contracts to determine the applicable net crude oil and NGL pricing for each property.  Operating expenses were determined based on estimated fixed and variable field production requirements, and capital expenditures were based on economically viable development projects.\n•\nTo compute estimated future cash flows for our CO\n2\nsource and transportation assets, throughput and production volume forecasts were developed based on projected demand for our CO\n2\nservices based upon management’s projections of the availability of CO\n2\nsupply and the future demand for CO\n2\nfor use in enhanced oil recovery projects.  The CO\n2\npricing assumption was a function of the March 31, 2020 NYMEX forward curve adjusted for the impact of existing sales contracts to determine the applicable net CO\n2\npricing.  Operating expenses were determined based on estimated fixed and variable field production requirements, and capital expenditures were based on economically viable development projects.\nCertain oil and gas properties failed the first step.  For these assets, we used a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate fair value.  We applied a\n10.5\n% discount rate, which we believe represented the estimated weighted average cost of capital of a theoretical market participant.  Based on step two of our long-lived assets impairment test, we recognized $\n350\nmillion of impairments on those oil and gas producing properties where the total carrying value exceeded its total estimated fair market value as of March 31, 2020.\nOur largest impairment for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a $\n650\nmillion non-cash impairment to our investment in Ruby in our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment.  The impairment of our investment was considered from our subordinated ownership position and driven by reduced cash flow estimates identified during the period which resulted from (i) increased Canadian gas supplies and competition from other natural gas pipelines and (ii) upcoming contract expirations.  These conditions were determined to be other than temporary.  We utilized a discounted cash flow analysis.\nAdditional impairments totaling $\n290\nmillion were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 on long-lived assets within our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment and were driven by continued reduced drilling activity in Oklahoma and northern Texas demonstrated in the fourth quarter.  Our largest impairment for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a $\n600\nmillion non-cash impairment in our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment driven by reduced cash flow estimates for some of our gathering and processing assets in Oklahoma identified during the period as a result of our decision to redirect our focus to other areas of our portfolio.\nRegarding our 2019 and 2018 impairments, for our long-lived assets, the reduced estimates triggered an impairment analysis, in each case, as we determined that our carrying value may no longer be recoverable.  The impairment analysis for long-lived assets was based upon a two-step process as prescribed in the accounting standards.  Step 1 involved comparing the undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from the asset group to the carrying value of the asset group.  Based on the results of our step 1 test, we determined that the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the asset group.  Step 2 involved using the income approach to calculate the fair value of the asset group and comparing it to the carrying value.  The impairment that we recorded represented the difference between the fair and carrying values.\n93\nGoodwill Impairments\nFollowing are the considerations made in our goodwill analysis and testing.\n•\nOur May 31, 2020 goodwill impairment tests of the Products Pipelines, Products Pipelines Terminals, Natural Gas Pipelines Regulated and CO\n2\nreporting units indicated that their fair values exceeded their carrying values.  The results of our impairment analyses for our Products Pipelines, Terminals and CO\n2\nreporting units, determined that each of the three reporting unit’s fair value was in excess of carrying value by less than\n10\n%.  For the Products Pipelines and Terminals reporting units, we used the market approach with assumptions similar to those described below for the Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated reporting unit.  For our May 31, 2020 goodwill impairment test of the CO\n2\nreporting unit we used the income approach with assumptions similar to those used for its March 31, 2020 goodwill impairment test.\n•\nIn regards to our Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated reporting unit, it experienced a sharp decline in customer demand for its services during the second quarter of 2020.  This represented a timing lag from the initial economic decline impacts resulting from the severe downturn in the upstream energy industry, including our CO\n2\nbusiness, whereby oil and gas producing companies accelerated their shut down of wells and reduced production during the second quarter which consequently adversely impacted the demand for our midstream services.  In addition, continued diminished (i) current and expected future commodity pricing and (ii) peer group market capitalization values provided further indicators that an impairment of goodwill had occurred for this reporting unit during the second quarter.\nOur May 31, 2020 goodwill impairment test for the Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated reporting unit utilized a weighted average of a market approach (\n25\n%) and income approach (\n75\n%) to estimate its fair value.  We gave higher weighting to the income approach as we believe it was more representative of the value that would be received from a market participant.\nThe market approach was based on enterprise value (EV) to estimated 2020 EBITDA multiples for a selected number of peer group midstream companies with comparable operations and economic characteristics.  We estimated the median EV to EBITDA multiple to be approximately\n10\nx without consideration of any control premium.  The income approach we used to determine fair value included an analysis of estimated discounted cash flows based on\n6.5\nyears of projections and application of an exit multiple based on management’s expectations of a discount rate and exit multiple that would be applied by a theoretical market participant and for market transactions of comparable assets.  We applied an approximate\n8\n% discount rate to the undiscounted cash flow amounts which represents our estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of a theoretical market participant.  The discounted cash flows included various assumptions on forecasted commodity throughput volumes and contract prices for each underlying asset within the reporting unit.  The fair value based on a weighting of the market and income approaches resulted in an implied EV to 2020 EBITDA multiple valuation of approximately\n11\nx.  Management believes this is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on comparable sales transactions and the fact that it implies a reasonable control premium.\nThe results of the Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated reporting unit goodwill impairment analysis was a partial impairment of goodwill of approximately $\n1,000\nmillion as of May 31, 2020.\n•\nFor our March 31, 2020 interim goodwill impairment test of the CO\n2\nreporting unit, we applied an income approach to evaluate its fair value based on the present value of its cash flows that it is expected to generate in the future.  Due to the uncertainty and volatility in market conditions within its peer group as of the test date, we did not incorporate the market approach to estimate fair value as of March 31, 2020.\nIn determining the fair value for our CO\n2\nreporting unit, we applied a\n9.25\n% discount rate to the undiscounted cash flow amounts computed in the long-lived asset impairment analyses described above.  The discount rate we used represents our estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of a theoretical market participant.  The result of our goodwill analysis was a partial impairment of goodwill in our CO\n2\nreporting unit of approximately $\n600\nmillion as of March 31, 2020.\nThe fair value estimates used in the long-lived asset and goodwill test were primarily based on Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.\nEconomic disruptions resulting from events such as COVID-19, conditions in the business environment generally, such as sustained low crude oil demand and continued low commodity prices, supply disruptions, or higher development or production costs, could result in a slowing of supply to our pipelines, terminals and other assets, which will have an adverse effect on the\n94\ndemand for services provided by our four business segments.  Financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us.\nAs conditions warrant, we routinely evaluate our assets for potential triggering events such as those described above that could impact the fair value of certain assets or our ability to recover the carrying value of long-lived assets.  Such assets include accounts receivable, equity investments, goodwill, other intangibles and property plant and equipment, including oil and gas properties and in-process construction.  Depending on the nature of the asset, these evaluations require the use of significant judgments including but not limited to judgments related to customer credit worthiness, future volume expectations, current and future commodity prices, discount rates, regulatory environment, as well as general economic conditions and the related demand for products handled or transported by our assets.  Although we did not identify additional triggering events during the third or fourth quarters of 2020, in the current worldwide economic and commodity price environment and to the extent conditions further deteriorate, we may identify additional triggering events that may require future evaluations of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, investments and goodwill which could result in further impairment charges.  Because certain of our assets have been written down to fair value, or its fair value is close to carrying value, any deterioration in fair value could result in further impairments.  Such non-cash impairments could have a significant effect on our results of operations, which would be recognized in the period in which the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable.\nFor additional information regarding changes in our goodwill, see Note 8.\nSale of U.S. Portion of Cochin Pipeline System and KML\nOn December 16, 2019, we closed on\ntwo\ncross-conditional transactions resulting in the sale of the U.S. portion of the Cochin Pipeline system and all the outstanding equity of KML, including our\n70\n% interest, to Pembina Pipeline Corporation (Pembina) (together, the “KML and U.S. Cochin Sale”).  We recognized a pre-tax net gain of $\n1,296\nmillion from these transactions within “Loss (gain) on impairments and divestitures, net” on our accompanying consolidated statement of income during the year ended December 31, 2019.  We received cash proceeds of $\n1,553\nmillion net of a working capital adjustment, for the U.S. portion of the Cochin Pipeline system which was used to pay down debt.  KML common shareholders received\n0.3068\nshares of Pembina common equity for each share of KML common equity.  For our\n70\n% interest in KML, we received approximately\n25\nmillion shares of Pembina common equity, with a pre-tax fair value on the transaction date of approximately $\n892\nmillion.  The fair market value as of December 31, 2019 of the Pembina common shares was $\n925\nmillion and is reported as “Marketable securities at fair value” within our accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.  Level 1 inputs in the fair value hierarchy were utilized to measure the fair value of the Pembina common shares. The Pembina common shares were sold on January 9, 2020, and we received proceeds of approximately $\n907\nmillion ($\n764\nmillion after tax).\nSale of Trans Mountain Pipeline System and Its Expansion Project\nOn August 31, 2018, KML completed the sale of the TMPL, the TMEP, the Puget Sound pipeline system for net cash consideration of C$\n4.43\nbillion (U.S.$\n3.4\nbillion), which is the contractual purchase price of C$\n4.5\nbillion net of a preliminary working capital adjustment (the “TMPL Sale”).  These assets comprised our Kinder Morgan Canada business segment.  We recognized a pre-tax gain from the TMPL Sale of $\n595\nmillion within “Loss (gain) on impairments and divestitures, net” in our accompanying consolidated statement of income during the year ended December 31, 2018.  During the first quarter of 2019, KML settled the remaining C$\n37\nmillion (U.S.$\n28\nmillion) of working capital adjustments which amount was substantially accrued for as of December 31, 2018.\nOn January 3, 2019, KML distributed the net proceeds from the TMPL Sale to its shareholders as a return of capital.   Public owners of KML’s restricted voting shares, reflected as noncontrolling interests by us, received approximately $\n0.9\nbillion (C$\n1.2\nbillion), and most of our approximate\n70\n% portion of the net proceeds of $\n1.9\nbillion (C$\n2.5\nbillion) (after Canadian tax) were used to repay our outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $\n0.4\nbillion and in February 2019, to pay down approximately $\n1.3\nbillion of maturing long-term debt.\n95\nThe components of “Income Before Income Taxes” are as follows:\nComponents of the income tax provision applicable for federal, foreign and state taxes are as follows:\n(a)\nOur Canadian income tax (benefit) expense was $(\n4\n) million, $\n165\nmillion and $\n168\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and our effective income tax rate is summarized as follows:\n96\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities result from the following:\nDeferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowances\nWe have deferred tax assets of $\n1,484\nmillion related to net operating loss carryovers, $\n257\nmillion related to general business and foreign tax credits, and $\n100\nmillion of valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020.  As of December 31, 2019, we had deferred tax assets of $\n1,261\nmillion related to net operating loss carryovers, $\n258\nmillion related to general business and foreign tax credits, and $\n117\nmillion of valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets.  We expect to generate taxable income and begin to utilize federal net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits in 2024.\nWe decreased our valuation allowances in 2020 by $\n17\nmillion, primarily due to $\n9\nmillion of statute expirations for state net operating losses and $\n8\nmillion of currency fluctuations on foreign net operating losses.\nExpiration Periods for Deferred Tax Assets:\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $\n2.6\nbillion that will be carried forward indefinitely and $\n3.4\nbillion that will expire from 2021 - 2037; state losses of $\n3.8\nbillion which will expire from 2021 - 2039; and foreign losses of $\n83\nmillion which will be carried forward indefinitely.  We also have $\n240\nmillion of general business credits which will expire from 2021 - 2039; and approximately $\n17\nmillion of foreign tax credits, which will expire from 2021 - 2027.  Use of a portion of our U.S. federal carryforwards is subject to the limitations provided under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code as well as the separate return limitation rules of Internal Revenue Service regulations.  If certain substantial changes in our ownership occur, there would be an annual limitation on the amount of carryforwards that could be utilized.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits:\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based not only on the technical merits of the tax position based on tax law, but also the past administrative practices and precedents of the taxing authority.  The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.\nOur gross unrecognized tax benefit balances, excluding immaterial amounts of interest and penalties, were $\n18\nmillion, $\n16\nmillion and $\n34\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Reductions based on settlements with taxing authorities were $\n0\nmillion, $\n21\nmillion and $\n73\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  All of the $\n18\nmillion of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate in future periods.  In addition, we believe it is reasonably possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $\n1\nmillion during the next year to approximately $\n17\nmillion, primarily due to releases from statute expirations, offset by additions for state filing positions taken in prior years.\nWe are subject to taxation, and have tax years open to examination for the periods 2016-2019 in the U.S., which include net operating loss utilization from earlier years, 2006-2019 in various states and 2007-2019 in various foreign jurisdictions.\n97\n6.  Property, Plant and Equipment, net\nClasses and Depreciation\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our property, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following:\n(a) Includes general plant, general structures and buildings, computer and communication equipment, intangibles, vessels, transmix products, linefill and miscellaneous property, plant and equipment.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, property, plant and equipment, net included $\n12,160\nmillion and $\n12,229\nmillion, respectively, of assets which were regulated by the FERC.  Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense charged against property, plant and equipment was $\n1,928\nmillion, $\n2,176\nmillion, and $\n2,057\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized asset retirement obligations in the aggregate amount of $\n214\nmillion and $\n218\nmillion, respectively, of which $\n4\nmillion were classified as current for both periods. The majority of our asset retirement obligations are associated with our CO\n2\nbusiness segment, where we are required to plug and abandon oil and gas wells that have been removed from service and to remove the surface wellhead equipment and compressors.\n98\n7.  Investments\nOur investments primarily consist of equity investments where we hold significant influence over investee actions and for which we apply the equity method of accounting.

The most restrictive of these include limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on sale-leaseback transactions.\n(c)\nOn January 4, 2021, we repaid our $\n750\nmillion senior corporate notes.\n(d)\nConsists of senior notes denominated in Euros that have been converted to U.S. dollars and are respectively reported above at the December 31, 2020 exchange rate of\n1.2216\nU.S. dollars per Euro and at the December 31, 2019 exchange rate of\n1.1213\nU.S. dollars per Euro.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the cumulative changes in the exchange rate of U.S. dollars per Euro since issuance had resulted in increases to our debt balance of $\n102\nmillion and $\n26\nmillion, respectively, related to the\n1.50\n% series and increases of $\n68\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion, respectively, related to the\n2.25\n% series.  The cumulative increase in debt due to the changes in exchange rates is offset by a corresponding change in the value of cross-currency swaps reflected in “Deferred charges and other assets” and “Other long-term liabilities and deferred credits” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  At the time of issuance, we entered into foreign currency contracts associated with these senior notes, effectively converting these Euro-denominated senior notes to U.S. dollars (see Note 14 “\nRisk Management—Foreign Currency Risk Management\n”).\n(e)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement which was designated as a cash flow hedge.\n(f)\nOn August 5, 2020, we issued in a registered offering two series of senior notes consisting of $\n750\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n2.00\n% senior notes due 2031 and $\n500\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n3.25\n% senior notes due 2050 and received combined net proceeds of $\n1,226\nmillion.\n(g)\nOn February 24, 2020, TGP issued in a private placement $\n1,000\nmillion aggregate principal amount of its\n2.90\n% senior notes due 2030 and received net proceeds of $\n991\nmillion.\n(h)\nCapital Trust I (Trust I), is a\n100\n%-owned business trust that as of December 31, 2020, had\n4.4\nmillion of\n4.75\n% trust convertible preferred securities outstanding (referred to as the Trust I Preferred Securities).  Trust I exists for the sole purpose of issuing preferred securities and investing the proceeds in\n4.75\n% convertible subordinated debentures, which are due 2028.  Trust I’s sole source of income is interest earned on these debentures.  This interest income is used to pay distributions on the preferred securities.  We provide a full and unconditional guarantee of the Trust I Preferred Securities.  There are no significant restrictions from these securities on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by distribution, dividend or loan.  The Trust I Preferred Securities are non-voting (except in limited circumstances), pay quarterly distributions at an annual rate of\n4.75\n% and carry a liquidation value of $\n50\nper security plus accrued and unpaid distributions. The Trust I Preferred Securities outstanding as of December 31, 2020 are convertible at any time prior to the close of business on March 31, 2028, at the option of the holder, into the following mixed consideration: (i)\n0.7197\nof a share of our Class P common stock; and (ii) $\n25.18\nin cash without interest.  We have the right to redeem these Trust I Preferred Securities at any time.\n(i)\nAs of December 31, 2019, KMGP had outstanding\n100,000\nshares of its $\n1,000\nLiquidation Value Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Term Cumulative Preferred Stock due 2057, which was redeemed including accrued dividends on January 15, 2020.\n(j)\nIncludes finance lease obligations with monthly installments.

In addition to all unamortized debt discount/premium amounts, debt issuance costs and purchase accounting on our debt balances, our debt fair value adjustments also include amounts associated with the offsetting entry for hedged debt and any unamortized portion of proceeds received from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements.  For further information about our debt fair value adjustments, see “—Debt Fair Value Adjustments” below.\nCurrent Portion of Debt\nThe following table details the components of our “Current portion of debt” reported on our consolidated balance sheets:\n(a)\nWeighted average interest rates on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was\n1.90\n%.\n(b)\nOn January 4, 2021, we repaid our $\n750\nmillion senior corporate notes.\n(c)\nReflects the portion of cash consideration payable if all the outstanding securities as of the end of the reporting period were converted by the holders.\n(d)\nIn December 2019, we notified the holder of our intent to redeem these securities.  As our notification was irrevocable, the outstanding balance was classified as current in our accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.  We redeemed these securities including accrued dividends on January 15, 2020.\nWe and substantially all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are a party to a cross guarantee agreement whereby each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally, the payment of specified indebtedness of each other party to the agreement.\nCredit Facility and Restrictive Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had borrowing capacity of approximately $\n3.9\nbillion under our $\n4\nbillion revolving credit facility.  We also continue to maintain a $\n4\nbillion commercial paper program through the private placement of short-term notes.  The notes mature up to\n270\ndays from the date of issue and are not redeemable or subject to voluntary prepayment by us prior to maturity.  The notes are sold at par value less a discount representing an interest factor or if interest bearing, at par.  Borrowings under our revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program.  Borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the borrowings allowed under our credit facility.\nDepending on the type of loan request, our credit facility borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at either (i) LIBOR adjusted for a eurocurrency funding reserve plus an applicable margin ranging from\n1.000\n% to\n2.000\n% per annum based on our credit ratings or (ii) the greatest of (1) the Federal Funds Rate plus\n0.5\n%; (2) the Prime Rate; or (3) LIBOR for a one-month eurodollar loan adjusted for a eurocurrency funding reserve, plus\n1\n%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin\n103\nranging from\n0.100\n% to\n1.000\n% per annum based on our credit rating.  Standby fees for the unused portion of the credit facility will be calculated at a rate ranging from\n0.100\n% to\n0.300\n%.\nOur credit facility contains financial and various other covenants that apply to us and our subsidiaries and are common in such agreements, including a maximum ratio of Consolidated Net Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit facility) of\n5.50\nto 1.00, for any four-fiscal-quarter period.  Other negative covenants include restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt, grant liens, make fundamental changes or engage in certain transactions with affiliates, or in the case of certain material subsidiaries, permit restrictions on dividends, distributions or making or prepayments of loans to us or any guarantor.  Our credit facility also restricts our ability to make certain restricted payments if an event of default (as defined in the credit facility) has occurred and is continuing or would occur and be continuing.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility,\nno\nborrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program and $\n82\nmillion in letters of credit.  Our availability under this facility as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $\n3.9\nbillion.  As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all required covenants.\nMaturities of Debt\nThe scheduled maturities of the outstanding debt balances, excluding debt fair value adjustments as of December 31, 2020, are summarized as follows:\nDebt Fair Value Adjustments\nThe following table summarizes the “Debt fair value adjustments” included on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets:\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average amortization period of the unamortized premium from the termination of interest rate swaps was approximately\n14\nyears.\n104\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value and estimated fair value of our outstanding debt balances is disclosed below:\nWe used Level 2 input values to measure the estimated fair value of our outstanding debt balance as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nInterest Rates, Interest Rate Swaps and Contingent Debt\nThe weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings was\n4.86\n% during 2020 and\n5.27\n% during 2019.

For information about our contingent debt agreements, see Note 13\n“\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities—Contingent Debt\n”).\n10.      Share-based Compensation and Employee Benefits\nShare-based Compensation\nClass P Shares\nKinder Morgan, Inc. Amended and Restated Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors\nWe have a Kinder Morgan, Inc. Amended and Restated Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, in which our eligible non-employee directors participate.  The plan recognizes that the compensation paid to each eligible non-employee director is fixed by our board of directors, generally annually, and that the compensation is payable in cash.  Pursuant to the plan, in lieu of receiving some or all of the cash compensation, each eligible non-employee director may elect to receive shares of Class P common stock.  Each election will be generally at or around the first board of directors meeting in January of each calendar year and will be effective for the entire calendar year.  An eligible director may make a new election each calendar year.  The total number of shares of Class P common stock authorized under the plan is\n250,000\n.  During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we made restricted Class P common stock grants to our non-employee directors of\n14,570\n,\n23,100\nand\n25,800\n, respectively.  These grants were valued at time of issuance at $\n0.3\nmillion, $\n0.4\nmillion and $\n0.5\nmillion, respectively.  All of the restricted stock awards made to non-employee directors vest during a\n6\n-month period.\nKinder Morgan, Inc. 2015 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan\nThe Kinder Morgan, Inc. 2015 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan is an equity awards plan available to eligible employees.  The total number of shares of Class P common stock authorized under the plan is\n33,000,000\n.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of activity and related balances of our restricted stock awards excluding that issued to non-employee directors:\n105\nThe following table sets forth additional information related to our restricted stock awards excluding that issued to non-employee directors:\nRestricted stock awards made to employees have vesting periods ranging from\n1\nyear up to\n10\nyears. Following is a summary of the future vesting of our outstanding restricted stock awards:\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $\n73\nmillion, $\n62\nmillion and $\n63\nmillion, respectively, in expense related to restricted stock awards and capitalized approximately $\n11\nmillion, $\n12\nmillion and $\n13\nmillion, respectively.  We allocate labor and benefit costs to joint ventures that we operate in accordance with our partnership agreements.  At December 31, 2020, unrecognized restricted stock awards compensation costs, less estimated forfeitures, was approximately $\n102\nmillion with a weighted average remaining amortization period of\n2.08\nyears.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit (OPEB) Plans\nSavings Plan\nWe maintain a defined contribution plan covering eligible U.S. employees.  We contribute\n5\n% of eligible compensation for most of the plan participants.  Certain collectively bargained participants receive Company contributions in accordance with collective bargaining agreements.  A participant becomes fully vested in Company contributions after\ntwo years\nand may take a distribution upon termination of employment or retirement.  The total cost for our savings plan was approximately $\n53\nmillion, $\n50\nmillion, and $\n48\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPension Plans\nOur pension plans are defined benefit plans that cover substantially all of our U.S. employees and provide benefits under a cash balance formula.  A participant in the cash balance formula accrues benefits through contribution credits based on a combination of age and years of service, multiplied by eligible compensation.  Interest is also credited to the participant’s plan account.  A participant becomes fully vested in the plan after\nthree years\nand may take a lump sum or annuity distribution upon termination of employment or retirement.  Certain collectively bargained and grandfathered employees accrue benefits through career pay or final pay formulas.\nOPEB Plans\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries provide OPEB benefits, including medical benefits for closed groups of retired employees and certain grandfathered employees and their dependents, and limited postretirement life insurance benefits for retired employees.  These plans provide a fixed subsidy to post-age\n65\nMedicare eligible participants to purchase coverage through a retiree Medicare exchange.  Medical benefits under these OPEB plans may be subject to deductibles, co-payment provisions, dollar caps and other limitations on the amount of employer costs, and we reserve the right to change these benefits.\n106\nBenefit Obligation, Plan Assets and Funded Status\n.  The following table provides information about our pension and OPEB plans as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe 2020 net actuarial loss for the pension plans was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020.  The 2020 net actuarial gain for the OPEB plans was primarily due to changes in the claims cost and trend assumptions, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020.  The 2019 net actuarial loss for the pension plans was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2019, partially offset by a change in the mortality assumption.  The 2019 net actuarial loss for the OPEB plans was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2019, partially offset by a change in the claims cost and mortality assumptions.\nComponents of Funded Status\n.  The following table details the amounts recognized in our balance sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 related to our pension and OPEB plans:\n(a)\n2020 and 2019 OPEB amounts include $\n46\nmillion and $\n39\nmillion, respectively, of non-current benefit assets related to a plan we sponsor which is associated with employee services provided to an unconsolidated joint venture, and for which we have recorded an offsetting related party deferred credit.\n107\nComponents of Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income\n.  The following table details the amounts of pre-tax accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income at December 31, 2020 and 2019 related to our pension and OPEB plans which are included on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets:\nOur accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans was $\n2,804\nmillion and $\n2,659\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for our OPEB plans, whose accumulated postretirement benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets, was $\n255\nmillion and $\n288\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The fair value of these plans’ assets was approximately $\n48\nmillion and $\n57\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPlan Assets.\nThe investment policies and strategies are established by our plan’s fiduciary committee for the assets of each of the pension and OPEB plans, which are responsible for investment decisions and management oversight of the plans. The stated philosophy of the fiduciary committee is to manage these assets in a manner consistent with the purpose for which the plans were established and the time frame over which the plans’ obligations need to be met.  The objectives of the investment management program are to (i) meet or exceed plan actuarial earnings assumptions over the long term and (ii) provide a reasonable return on assets within established risk tolerance guidelines and to maintain the liquidity needs of the plans with the goal of paying benefit and expense obligations when due.  In seeking to meet these objectives, the fiduciary committee recognizes that prudent investing requires taking reasonable risks in order to raise the likelihood of achieving the targeted investment returns.  In order to reduce portfolio risk and volatility, the fiduciary committee has adopted a strategy of using multiple asset classes.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the allowable range for asset allocations in effect for our pension plan were\n31\n% to\n55\n% equity,\n37\n% to\n57\n% fixed income,\n0\n% to\n5\n% cash,\n0\n% to\n2\n% alternative investments and\n0\n% to\n10\n% company securities (KMI Class P common stock and/or debt securities).  As of December 31, 2020, the allowable range for asset allocations in effect for our OPEB plans were\n46\n% to\n68\n% equity,\n25\n% to\n50\n% fixed income and\n0\n% to\n22\n% cash.\nBelow are the details of our pension and OPEB plan assets by class and a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value.\n•\nLevel 1 assets’ fair values are based on quoted market prices for the instruments in actively traded markets.  Included in this level are cash, equities and exchange traded mutual funds.  These investments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.\n•\nLevel 2 assets’ fair values are primarily based on pricing data representative of quoted prices for similar assets in active markets (or identical assets in less active markets).  Included in this level are short-term investment funds, fixed income securities and derivatives.  Short-term investment funds are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.  The fixed income securities’ fair values are primarily based on an evaluated price which is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market.  Derivatives are exchange-traded through clearinghouses and are valued based on these prices.\n•\nPlan assets with fair values that are based on the net asset value per share, or its equivalent (NAV), as reported by the issuers are determined based on the fair value of the underlying securities as of the valuation date and include common/collective trust funds, private investment funds and limited partnerships.  The plan assets measured at NAV are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy described above, but are separately identified in the following tables.\n108\nListed below are the fair values of our pension and OPEB plans’ assets that are recorded at fair value by class and categorized by fair value measurement used at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(a)\nPlan assets include $\n83\nmillion and $\n129\nmillion of KMI Class P common stock for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(b)\nPlan assets include $\n1\nmillion of KMI debt securities for both 2020 and 2019.\n(c)\nPlan assets which used NAV as a practical expedient to measure fair value.\n(d)\nCommon/collective trust funds were invested in approximately\n29\n% fixed income and\n71\n% equity in 2020 and\n32\n% fixed income and\n68\n% equity in 2019.\n(e)\nPrivate investment funds were invested in approximately\n71\n% fixed income and\n29\n% equity in 2020 and\n73\n% fixed income and\n27\n% equity in 2019.\n(f)\nIncludes assets invested in real estate, venture and buyout funds.\n(a)\nIncludes mutual funds which are invested in equities and fixed income securities.\n(b)\nPlan assets which used NAV as a practical expedient to measure fair value.\n(c)\nCommon/collective trust funds were invested in approximately\n65\n% equity and\n35\n% fixed income securities for 2020 and\n64\n% equity and\n36\n% fixed income securities for 2019.\n109\nExpected Payment of Future Benefits and Employer Contributions\n.  As of December 31, 2020, we expect to make the following benefit payments under our plans:\n(a)\nIncludes a reduction of approximately $\n1\nmillion in each of the years 2021 through 2025 and approximately $\n6\nmillion in aggregate for the period 2026 - 2030 for an expected subsidy related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.\nIn 2021, we expect to contribute approximately $\n56\nmillion to our pension plans and $\n7\nmillion, net of anticipated subsidies, to our OPEB plans.\nActuarial Assumptions and Sensitivity Analysis\n.  Benefit obligations and net benefit cost are based on actuarial estimates and assumptions.  The following table details the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used in determining our benefit obligation and net benefit costs of our pension and OPEB plans for 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(a)\nThe expected return on plan assets listed in the table above is a pre-tax rate of return based on our targeted portfolio of investments. For the OPEB assets subject to unrelated business income taxes (UBIT), we utilize an after-tax expected return on plan assets to determine our benefit costs, which is based on UBIT rates of\n27\n%,\n27\n% and\n21\n% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our retirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows.  The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were determined by combining a review of the historical returns realized within the portfolio, the investment strategy included in the plans’ investment policy, and capital market projections for the asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the target weightings of each asset class.\nActuarial estimates for our OPEB plans assume an annual increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits; the initial annual rate of increase is\n5.80\n% which gradually decreases to\n4.50\n% by the year 2038.\n110\nComponents of Net Benefit Cost and Other Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, the components of net benefit cost and other amounts recognized in pre-tax other comprehensive income related to our pension and OPEB plans are as follows:\n(a)\nExcludes $\n2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with other plans.\nMultiemployer Plans\nWe participate in several multi-employer pension plans for the benefit of employees who are union members.  We do not administer these plans and contribute to them in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts.  Other benefits include a self-insured health and welfare insurance plan and an employee health plan where employees may contribute for their dependents’ health care costs.  Amounts charged to expense for these plans were approximately $\n6\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $\n8\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. We consider the overall multi-employer pension plan liability exposure to be immaterial in relation to the value of its total consolidated assets and net income.\nMandatory Convertible Preferred Stock\nAs of October 26, 2018, all of our issued and outstanding\n1,600,000\nshares of\n9.75\n% Series A mandatory convertible preferred stock, with a liquidating preference of $\n1,000\nper share were converted into common stock either at the option of the holders before or automatically on October 26, 2018.  Based on the market price of our common stock at the time of conversion, our Series A Preferred Shares converted into approximately\n58\nmillion common shares.  We paid all dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock in cash.\n111\nCommon Equity\nAs of December 31, 2020, our common equity consisted of our Class P common stock.\nOn July 19, 2017, our board of directors approved a $\n2\nbillion common share buy-back program that began in December 2017.  During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we repurchased approximately\n4\nmillion,\n0.1\nmillion and\n15\nmillion, respectively, of our Class P shares for approximately $\n50\nmillion, $\n2\nmillion and $\n273\nmillion, respectively. Since December 2017, in total, we have repurchased approximately\n32\nmillion of our Class P shares under the program at an average price of approximately $\n17.71\nper share for approximately $\n575\nmillion.\nOn December 19, 2014, we entered into an equity distribution agreement authorizing us to issue and sell through or to the managers party thereto, as sales agents and/or principals, shares of our Class P common stock having an aggregate offering of up to $\n5.0\nbillion from time to time during the term of this agreement.  During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we did not issue any Class P common stock under this agreement.\nKMI Common Stock Dividends\nHolders of our common stock participate in any dividend declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding preferred stock.\nThe following table provides information about our per share dividends:\nOn January 20, 2021, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $\n0.2625\nper common share for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2020, which is payable on February 16, 2021 to shareholders of record as of February 1, 2021.\n112\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nReporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nCumulative revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are included within our comprehensive income but excluded from our earnings are reported as “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within “Stockholders’ Equity” in our consolidated balance sheets.\nChanges in the components of our “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” not including non-controlling interests are summarized as follows:\n(a)\nAmounts for foreign currency translation adjustments and pension and other postretirement liability adjustments reflect the deferred losses recognized in income during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the TMPL Sale.  Amount for foreign currency translation adjustments reflect the deferred losses recognized in income during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the sale of KML.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nKML Distributions\nIn accordance with its dividend policy, KML, our former indirect subsidiary, paid dividends during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, on its restricted voting shares to the public valued at $\n17\nmillion and $\n52\nmillion, respectively, of which $\n17\nmillion and $\n38\nmillion, respectively, was paid in cash.  The remaining value of $\n14\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, was paid in\n1,092,791\nKML restricted voting shares.  KML also paid dividends to the public on its preferred shares of $\n22\nmillion and $\n21\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOn January 3, 2019, KML distributed approximately $\n0.9\nbillion of the net proceeds from the TMPL Sale to its public held restricted voting shareholders as a return of capital.\n113\nAdoption of Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-05, “\nClarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets\n.”  This ASU clarifies the scope and application of ASC 610-20 on contracts for the sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets to noncustomers, including partial sales. This ASU also clarifies that the derecognition of all businesses is in the scope of ASC 810 and defines an “in substance nonfinancial asset.” We utilized the modified retrospective method to adopt the provisions of this ASU, which required us to apply the new standard to (i) all new contracts entered into after January 1, 2018, and (ii) to contracts that were not completed contracts as of January 1, 2018 through a cumulative adjustment to our “Accumulated deficit” balance.  The cumulative effect of the adoption of this ASU was a $\n66\nmillion, net of income taxes, adjustment to our beginning “Accumulated deficit” balance as presented in our consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2018.  This ASU also required us to classify EIG Global Energy Partners’ (EIG) cumulative contribution to ELC as mezzanine equity, which we have included as “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest” on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as EIG has the right to redeem their interests for cash under certain conditions.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2018-02, “\nReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\n.”  Our accounting policy for the release of stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income is on an aggregate portfolio basis.  This ASU permits companies to reclassify the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Reform on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.  The FASB refers to these amounts as “stranded tax effects.”  Only the stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Reform are eligible for reclassification.  The adoption of this ASU resulted in a $\n109\nmillion reclassification adjustment of stranded income tax effects from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” to “Accumulated deficit” on our consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n12.  Related Party Transactions\nAffiliate Balances\nWe have transactions with affiliates which consist of (i) unconsolidated affiliates in which we hold an investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting (see Note 7 for additional information related to these investments); and (ii) external partners of our joint ventures we consolidate, and for periods prior to the sale of KML, our proportional method joint ventures, for which we include our proportionate share of balances and activity in our financial statements.\n114\nThe following tables summarize our affiliate balance sheet balances and income statement activity, other than amounts reported within our “Investments” balances and “Earnings from equity investments” activity:\n13.\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\nRights-Of-Way (ROW) Obligations\nOur ROW obligations primarily consist of non-lease agreements that existed at the time of Topic 842 adoption, at which time we elected a practical expedient which allowed us to continue our historical treatment.  Our future minimum rental commitments related to our ROW obligations were $\n172\nmillion as of December 31, 2020.\nContingent Debt\nOur contingent debt disclosures pertain to certain types of guarantees or indemnifications we have made and cover certain types of guarantees included within debt agreements, even if the likelihood of requiring our performance under such guarantee is remote.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our contingent debt obligations, as well as our obligations with respect to related letters of credit, totaled $\n217\nmillion and $\n330\nmillion, respectively.  December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounts are represented by our proportional share of the debt obligations of\nthree\nequity investees.  Under such guarantees we are severally liable for our percentage ownership share of these equity investees’ debt issued in the event of their non-performance. The contingent debt obligations balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 included $\n122\nmillion and $\n128\nmillion, respectively, for\n100\n% guaranteed debt obligations for a subsidiary of our equity investee, Cortez Pipeline Company.\n115\nGuarantees and Indemnifications\nOur equity investee, SNG, has $\n300\nmillion of debt maturing in June 2021 that it anticipates refinancing.  We currently have a commitment to SNG to fund $\n150\nmillion if SNG is unable to refinance or otherwise satisfy its obligation.\nWe are involved in joint ventures and other ownership arrangements that sometimes require financial and performance guarantees.  In a financial guarantee, we are obligated to make payments if the guaranteed party fails to make payments under, or violates the terms of, the financial arrangement.  In a performance guarantee, we provide assurance that the guaranteed party will execute on the terms of the contract.  If they do not, we are required to perform on their behalf.  We also periodically provide indemnification arrangements related to assets or businesses we have sold.  These arrangements include, but are not limited to, indemnifications for income taxes, the resolution of existing disputes and environmental matters.\nWhile many of these agreements may specify a maximum potential exposure, or a specified duration to the indemnification obligation, there are also circumstances where the amount and duration are unlimited. Currently, we are not subject to any material requirements to perform under quantifiable arrangements other than as described above. We are unable to estimate a maximum exposure for our other guarantee and indemnification agreements that do not provide for limits on the amount of future payments due to the uncertainty of these exposures.\nSee Note 18 for a description of matters that we have identified as contingencies requiring accrual of liabilities and/or disclosure, including any such matters arising under guarantee or indemnification agreements.\n14.  Risk Management\nCertain of our business activities expose us to risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas, NGL and crude oil.  We also have exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk as a result of the issuance of our debt obligations.  Pursuant to our management’s approved risk management policy, we use derivative contracts to hedge or reduce our exposure to some of these risks.\nEnergy Commodity Price Risk Management\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had the following outstanding commodity forward contracts to hedge our forecasted energy commodity purchases and sales:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the maximum length of time over which we have hedged, for accounting purposes, our exposure to the variability in future cash flows associated with energy commodity price risk is through December 2024.\n116\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nWe utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to both changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments and variability in expected future cash flows attributable to variable interest rate payments.\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding interest rate contracts as of December 31, 2020:\n(a)\nThe principal amount of hedged senior notes consisted of $\n900\nmillion included in “Current portion of debt” and $\n6,725\nmillion included in “Long-term debt” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nWe utilize foreign currency derivatives to hedge our exposure to variability in foreign exchange rates.\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2020:\n(a)   These\ns\nwaps eliminate the foreign currency risk associated with all of our Euro-denominated debt.\n117\nImpact of Derivative Contracts on Our Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative contracts included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets:\nThe following two tables summarize the fair value measurements of our derivative contracts based on the three levels established by the ASC.  The tables also identify the impact of derivative contracts which we have elected to present on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis that are eligible for netting under master netting agreements.\n118\n(a)\nLevel 1 consists primarily of NYMEX natural gas futures.  Level 2 consists primarily of OTC WTI swaps, NGL swaps and crude oil basis swaps.\n(b)\nAny cash collateral paid or received is reflected in this table, but only to the extent that it represents variation margins.  Any amount associated with derivative prepayments or initial margins that are not influenced by the derivative asset or liability amounts or those that are determined solely on their volumetric notional amounts are excluded from this table.\nThe following tables summarize the pre-tax impact of our derivative contracts in our accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income:\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2020, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to our hedged fixed rate debt was an increase of $\n702\nmillion included in “Debt fair value adjustments” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n(a)\nWe expect to reclassify an approximate $\n9\nmillion gain associated with cash flow hedge price risk management activities included in our accumulated other comprehensive loss balance as of December 31, 2020 into earnings during the next twelve months (when the associated forecasted transactions are also expected to impact earnings); however, actual amounts reclassified into earnings could vary materially as a result of changes in market prices.\n(b)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a $\n12\nmillion gain associated with a write-down of hedged inventory.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a $\n3\nmillion loss as a result of our equity investment’s forecasted transactions being probable of not occurring and a $\n21\nmillion gain associated with a write-down of hedged inventory. All other amounts reclassified were\n119\nthe result of the hedged forecasted transactions actually affecting earnings (i.e., when the forecasted sales and purchases actually occurred).\n(c)\nAmounts represent our share of an equity investee’s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n(a)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized an $\n83\nmillion gain related to the KML and U.S. Cochin Sale. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a $\n26\nmillion gain related to the TMPL Sale.  See Note 4.\n(a)  The years ended December 31, 2020\n,\n2019 and 2018 include approximate gains of $\n11\nmillion and losses of $\n8\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion, respectively, associated with natural gas, crude and NGL derivative contract settlements.\n(b)  Amounts represent our share of an equity investee’s income (loss).\nCredit Risks\nIn conjunction with certain derivative contracts, we are required to provide collateral to our counterparties, which may include posting letters of credit or placing cash in margin accounts.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had\nno\noutstanding letters of credit supporting our commodity price risk management program.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash margins of $\n3\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion, respectively, posted by our counterparties with us as collateral and reported within “Other current liabilities” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The balance at December 31, 2020 represents the net of our initial margin requirements of $\n11\nmillion, offset by counterparty variation margin requirements of $\n8\nmillion.  We also use industry standard commercial agreements that allow for the netting of exposures associated with transactions executed under a single commercial agreement.  Additionally, we generally utilize master netting agreements to offset credit exposure across multiple commercial agreements with a single counterparty.\nWe also have agreements with certain counterparties to our derivative contracts that contain provisions requiring the posting of additional collateral upon a decrease in our credit rating.  As of December 31, 2020, based on our current mark-to- market positions and posted collateral, we estimate that if our credit rating were downgraded one notch, we would not be required to post additional collateral. If we were downgraded two notches, we estimate that we would be required to post $\n6\nmillion of additional collateral.\n120\n15.  Revenue Recognition\nNature of Revenue by Segment\nNatural Gas Pipelines Segment\nWe provide various types of natural gas transportation and storage services, natural gas and NGL sales contracts, and various types of gathering and processing services for producers, including receiving, compressing, transporting and re-delivering quantities of natural gas and/or NGLs made available to us by producers to a specified delivery location.\nNatural Gas Transportation and Storage Contracts\nThe natural gas we receive under our transportation and storage contracts remains under the control of our customers.  Under firm service contracts, the customer generally pays a two-part transaction price that includes (i) a fixed fee reserving the right to transport or store natural gas in our facilities up to contractually specified capacity levels (referred to as “reservation”) and (ii) a fee-based per-unit rate for quantities of natural gas actually transported or injected into/withdrawn from storage.  In our firm service contracts we generally promise to provide a single integrated service each day over the life of the contract, which is fundamentally a stand-ready obligation to provide services up to the customer’s reservation capacity prescribed in the contract.  Our customers have a take-or-pay payment obligation with respect to the fixed reservation fee component, regardless of the quantities they actually transport or store.  In other cases, generally described as interruptible service, there is no fixed fee associated with these transportation and storage services because the customer accepts the possibility that service may be interrupted at our discretion in order to serve customers who have firm service contracts.  We do not have an obligation to perform under interruptible customer arrangements until we accept and schedule the customer’s request for periodic service.  The customer pays a transaction price on a fee-based per-unit rate for the quantities actually transported or injected into/withdrawn from storage.\nNatural Gas and NGL Sales Contracts\nOur sales and purchases of natural gas and NGL are primarily accounted for on a gross basis as natural gas sales or product sales, as applicable, and cost of sales.  These customer contracts generally provide for the customer to nominate a specified quantity of commodity products to be delivered and sold to the customers at specified delivery points.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a market indexed per-unit rate for the quantities sold.\nGathering and Processing Contracts\nWe provide various types of gathering and processing services for producers, including receiving, processing, compressing, transporting and re-delivering quantities of natural gas made available to us by producers to a specified delivery location.  This integrated service can be firm if subject to a minimum volume commitment or acreage dedication or non-firm when offered on an as requested, non-guaranteed basis.  In our gathering contracts we generally promise to provide the contracted integrated services each day over the life of the contract.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a per-unit rate for the quantities actually gathered and/or processed, including amounts attributable to deficiency quantities associated with minimum volume contracts.\nProducts Pipelines Segment\nWe provide crude oil and refined petroleum transportation and storage services on a firm or non-firm basis.  For our firm transportation service, we typically promise to transport on a stand-ready basis the customer’s minimum volume commitment amount.  The customer is obligated to pay for its volume commitment amount, regardless of whether or not it flows volumes into our pipeline.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a per-unit rate for quantities transported, including amounts attributable to deficiency quantities.  Our firm storage service generally includes a fixed monthly fee for the portion of storage capacity reserved by the customer and a per-unit rate for actual quantities injected into/withdrawn from storage.  The customer is obligated to pay the fixed monthly reservation fee, regardless of whether or not it uses our storage facility (i.e., take-or-pay payment obligation).  Non-firm transportation and storage service is provided to our customers when and to the extent we determine the requested capacity is available in our pipeline system and/or terminal storage facility.  The customer typically pays a per-unit rate for actual quantities of product injected into/withdrawn from storage and/or transported.\nWe sell transmix, crude oil or other commodity products.  The customer’s contracts generally include a specified quantity of commodity products to be delivered and sold to the customers at specified delivery points.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a market indexed per-unit rate for the quantities sold.\n121\nTerminals Segment\nWe provide various types of liquid tank and bulk terminal services.  These services are generally comprised of inbound, storage and outbound handling of customer products.\nLiquids Tank Services\nFirm Storage and Handling Contracts:  We have liquids tank storage and handling service contracts that include a promised tank storage capacity provision and prepaid volume throughput of the stored product.  In these contracts, we have a stand-ready obligation to perform this contracted service each day over the life of the contract.  The customer pays a transaction price typically in the form of a fixed monthly charge and is obligated to pay whether or not it uses the storage capacity and throughput service (i.e., a take-or-pay payment obligation).  These contracts generally include a per-unit rate for any quantities we handle at the request of the customer in excess of the prepaid volume throughput amount and also typically include per-unit rates for additional, ancillary services that may be periodically requested by the customer.\nFirm Handling Contracts:  For our firm handling service contracts, we typically promise to handle on a stand-ready basis throughput volumes up to the customer’s minimum volume commitment amount.  The customer is obligated to pay for its minimum volume commitment amount, regardless of whether or not it used the handling service.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a per-unit rate for volumes handled, including amounts attributable to deficiency quantities.\nBulk Services\nOur bulk storage and handling contracts generally include inbound handling of our customers’ dry bulk material product (e.g. petcoke, metals, ores) into our storage facility and outbound handling of these products from our storage facility.  These services are provided on both a firm and non-firm basis.  In our firm bulk storage and handling contracts, we are committed to handle and store on a stand-ready basis the minimum throughput quantity of bulk materials contracted by the customer.  In some cases, the customer is obligated to pay for its minimum volume commitment amount, regardless of whether or not it uses the storage and handling service.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a per-unit rate for quantities handled, including amounts attributable to deficiency quantities.  For non-firm storage and handling services, the customer pays a transaction price typically based on a per-unit rate for quantities handled on an as requested, non-guaranteed basis.\nCO\n2\nSegment\nOur crude oil, NGL, CO\n2\nand natural gas production customer sales contracts typically include a specified quantity and quality of commodity product to be delivered and sold to the customer at a specified delivery point.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a market indexed per-unit rate for the quantities sold.\nKinder Morgan Canada Segment\nOn August 31, 2018, the assets comprising the Kinder Morgan Canada business segment were sold; therefore, this segment will not have revenues on a prospective basis (see Note 4).  Prior to the sale of these assets, we provided crude oil and refined petroleum transportation services generally as described above for non-firm, interruptible transportation services in our Products Pipelines business segment.  The TMPL regulated tariff was designed to provide revenues sufficient to recover the costs of providing transportation services to shippers, including a return on invested capital.  TMPL’s revenue was adjusted according to terms prescribed in our toll settlement with shippers as approved by the National Energy Board (NEB).  Differences between transportation revenue recognized pursuant to our toll settlement and actual toll receipts were recognized as regulatory assets or liabilities and settled through future tolls.\n122\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe following tables present our revenues disaggregated by revenue source and type of revenue for each revenue source:\n123\n(a)\nDifferences between the revenue classifications presented on the consolidated statements of income and the categories for the disaggregated revenues by type of revenue above are primarily attributable to revenues reflected in the “Other revenues” category above (see note (c)).\n(b)\nIncludes non-cancellable firm service customer contracts with take-or-pay or minimum volume commitment elements, including those contracts where both the price and quantity amount are fixed. Excludes service contracts with indexed-based pricing, which along with revenues from other customer service contracts are reported as Fee-based services.\n(c)\nAmounts recognized as revenue under guidance prescribed in Topics of the ASC other than in Topic 606 were primarily from leases and derivative contracts.  See Note 14 for additional information related to our derivative contracts.\n(d)\nOn August 31, 2018, the assets comprising the Kinder Morgan Canada business segment were sold; therefore, this segment does not have results of operations on a prospective basis (see Note 4).\nContract Balances\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our contract asset balances were $\n20\nmillion and $\n27\nmillion, respectively.  Of the contract asset balance at December 31, 2019, $\n24\nmillion was transferred to accounts receivable during the year ended December 31. 2020.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our contract liability balances were $\n239\nmillion and $\n232\nmillion, respectively.  Of the contract liability balance at December 31, 2019, $\n65\nmillion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n124\nRevenue Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations\nThe following table presents our estimated revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, representing our “contractually committed” revenue as of December 31, 2020 that we will invoice or transfer from contract liabilities and recognize in future periods:\nOur contractually committed revenue, for purposes of the tabular presentation above, is generally limited to service or commodity sale customer contracts which have fixed pricing and fixed volume terms and conditions, generally including contracts with take-or-pay or minimum volume commitment payment obligations.  Our contractually committed revenue amounts generally exclude, based on the following practical expedient that we elected to apply, remaining performance obligations for contracts with index-based pricing or variable volume attributes in which such variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.\n16.  Reportable Segments\nOur reportable business segments are:\n•\nNatural Gas Pipelines—the ownership and operation of (i) major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems; (ii) natural gas gathering systems and natural gas processing and treating facilities; (iii) NGL fractionation facilities and transportation systems; and (iv) LNG regasification, liquefaction and storage facilities;\n•\nProducts Pipelines—the ownership and operation of refined petroleum products, crude oil and condensate pipelines that primarily deliver, among other products, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, crude oil and condensate to various markets, plus the ownership and/or operation of associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities;\n•\nTerminals—the ownership and/or operation of (i) liquids and bulk terminal facilities located throughout the U.S. and portions of Canada (prior to the sale of KML in December 2019) that store and handle various commodities including gasoline, diesel fuel, chemicals, ethanol, metals and petroleum coke; and (ii) Jones Act-qualified tankers;\n•\nCO\n2\n—(i) the production, transportation and marketing of CO\n2\nto oil fields that use CO\n2\nas a flooding medium to increase recovery and production of crude oil from mature oil fields; (ii) ownership interests in and/or operation of oil fields and gasoline processing plants in West Texas; and (iii) the ownership and operation of a crude oil pipeline system in West Texas; and\n•\nKinder Morgan Canada (prior to August 31, 2018)—the ownership and operation of the Trans Mountain pipeline system that transports crude oil and refined petroleum products from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada to marketing terminals and refineries in British Columbia, Canada and the state of Washington.  As a result of the TMPL Sale, this segment does not have results of operations on a prospective basis.\nWe evaluate performance principally based on each segment’s EBDA, which excludes general and administrative expenses and corporate charges, interest expense, net, and income tax expense.  Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services, and they are structured based on how our chief operating decision makers organize their operations for optimal performance and resource allocation.  Each segment is managed separately because each segment involves different products and services and marketing strategies.\nWe consider each period’s earnings before all non-cash DD&A expenses to be an important measure of business segment performance for our reporting segments.  We account for intersegment sales at market prices, while we account for asset transfers at book value.\n125\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, we did not have revenues from any single external customer that exceeded\n10\n% of our consolidated revenues.\nFinancial information by segment follows:\n126\n127\n(a)\nIncludes costs of sales, operations and maintenance expenses, and taxes, other than income taxes.\n(b)\nIncludes loss (gain) on impairments and divestitures, net and other income, net.\n(c)\nIncludes revenues, earnings from equity investments, and other, net, less operating expenses, loss (gain) on impairments and divestitures, net and other income, net.\n(d)\nIncludes cash and cash equivalents, margin and restricted deposits, certain prepaid assets and deferred charges, including income tax related assets, risk management assets related to debt fair value adjustments, corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas and miscellaneous corporate assets (such as information technology, telecommunications equipment and legacy balances) not allocated to our reportable segments.\nWe do not attribute interest and debt expense to any of our reportable business segments.\n128\nFollowing is geographic information regarding the revenues and long-lived assets of our business:\n17.  Leases\nLessee\nFollowing are components of our lease cost:\n(a)\n2020 and 2019 amounts include $\n25\nmillion and  $\n46\nmillion of capitalized lease costs.\nOther information related to our operating leases are as follows:\n129\nAmounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet are as follows:\nOperating lease liabilities under non-cancellable leases (excluding short-term leases) as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nShort-term lease costs are not material to us and are anticipated to be similar to the current year short-term lease expense outlined in this disclosure.\n18.  Litigation and Environmental\nWe and our subsidiaries are parties to various legal, regulatory and other matters arising from the day-to-day operations of our businesses or certain predecessor operations that may result in claims against the Company.  Although no assurance can be given, we believe, based on our experiences to date and taking into account established reserves and insurance, that the ultimate resolution of such items will not have a material adverse impact to our business.  We believe we have meritorious defenses to the matters to which we are a party and intend to vigorously defend the Company.  When we determine a loss is probable of occurring and is reasonably estimable, we accrue an undiscounted liability for such contingencies based on our best estimate using information available at that time.  If the estimated loss is a range of potential outcomes and there is no better estimate within the range, we accrue the amount at the low end of the range.  We disclose contingencies where an adverse outcome may be material or, in the judgment of management, we conclude the matter should otherwise be disclosed.\nFERC Inquiry Regarding the Commission’s Policy for Determining Return on Equity\nOn March 21, 2019, the FERC issued a notice of inquiry (NOI) seeking comments regarding whether the FERC should revise its policies for determining the base return on equity (ROE) used in setting cost of service rates charged by jurisdictional public utilities and interstate natural gas and liquids pipelines.  The NOI sought comment on whether any aspects of the existing methodologies used by the FERC to set an ROE for a regulated entity should be changed, whether the ROE methodology should be the same across all three industries, and whether alternative methodologies should be considered.  Comments were filed by industry groups, pipeline companies and shippers for review and evaluation by the FERC. On May 21, 2020, the FERC issued its Policy Statement on Determining Return on Equity for Natural Gas and Oil Pipelines (Policy Statement).  As it applies to natural gas and oil pipelines, the Policy Statement requires averaging the results of the discounted cash flow model and capital asset pricing model, giving equal weight to each model, retains its existing two-thirds/one-third weighting of short and long-term growth projections in the discounted cash flow model, and excludes the risk premium or expected earnings models.  On other matters raised in this proceeding, the FERC declined to adopt rigid policy changes, and will address issues, such as the appropriate sources for data sets and the specific companies to use for a given proxy group, as those issues arise in\n130\nfuture rate proceedings on a pipeline-by-pipeline, case-by-case basis.  The Policy Statement does not result in any immediate changes to any existing rates or ROEs for any of our pipelines, and any future changes to rates or ROEs for a pipeline will depend on a variety of factors that remain to be determined when they are raised and argued in connection with future or existing rate proceedings.\nSFPP FERC Proceedings\nThe FERC approved the SFPP East Line Settlement in Docket No. IS21-138 (“EL Settlement”) on December 31, 2020 and it became final and effective on February 2, 2021.  The EL Settlement resolved certain dockets in their entirety (IS09-437 and OR16-6) and resolved the SFPP East Line related disputes in other dockets which remain ongoing (OR14-35/36 and OR19-21/33/37).  The amounts SFPP agreed to pay pursuant to the EL Settlement were fully accrued on or before December 31, 2020.\nThe tariffs and rates charged by SFPP which were not fully resolved by the EL Settlement are subject to a number of ongoing shipper-initiated proceedings at the FERC.  In general, these complaints and protests allege the rates and tariffs charged by SFPP are not just and reasonable under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA).  In some of these proceedings shippers have challenged the overall rate being charged by SFPP, and in others the shippers have challenged SFPP’s index-based rate increases.  The issues involved in these proceedings include, among others, whether indexed rate increases are justified, and the appropriate level of return and income tax allowance SFPP may include in its rates.  If the shippers prevail on their arguments or claims, they would be entitled to seek reparations for the\ntwo\n-year period preceding the filing date of their complaints and/or prospective refunds in protest cases from the date of protest, and SFPP may be required to reduce its rates going forward.  With respect to the ongoing shipper-initiated proceedings at the FERC that were not fully resolved by the EL Settlement, the shippers pleaded claims to at least $\n50\nmillion in rate refunds and unspecified rate reductions as of the date of their complaints in 2014 and 2018.  These proceedings tend to be protracted, with decisions of the FERC often appealed to the federal courts.  Management believes SFPP has meritorious arguments supporting SFPP’s rates and intends to vigorously defend SFPP against these complaints and protests.  We do not believe the ultimate resolution of the shipper complaints and protests seeking rate reductions or refunds in the ongoing proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our business.\nEPNG FERC Proceedings\nThe tariffs and rates charged by EPNG were subject to\ntwo\nFERC proceedings (the “2008 rate case” and the “2010 rate case”).  With respect to the 2008 rate case, the FERC issued its decision (Opinion 517-A) in July 2015.  The FERC generally upheld its prior determinations, ordered refunds to be paid within 60 days, and stated that its findings in Opinion 517-A would apply to the same issues in the 2010 rate case.  All refund obligations related to the 2008 rate case were satisfied in 2015.  EPNG sought federal appellate review of Opinion 517-A.  With respect to the 2010 rate case, the FERC issued its decision (Opinion 528-A) on February 18, 2016.  The FERC generally upheld its prior determinations, affirmed prior findings of an Administrative Law Judge that certain shippers qualify for lower rates, and required EPNG to file revised pro forma recalculated rates consistent with Opinions 517-A and 528-A.  On May 3, 2018, the FERC issued Opinion 528-B upholding its decisions in Opinion 528-A and requiring EPNG to implement the rates required by its rulings and provide refunds within 60 days.  On July 2, 2018, EPNG reported to the FERC that the refunds had been provided as ordered.  Also on July 2, 2018, EPNG initiated appellate review of Opinions 528, 528-A and 528-B.  EPNG’s appeals in the 2008 and 2010 rate cases as well as the intervenors’ appeal in the 2010 rate case were consolidated.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied all petitions for review on July 24, 2020, which concludes these rate proceedings.\nGulf LNG Facility Disputes\nOn March 1, 2016, Gulf LNG Energy, LLC and Gulf LNG Pipeline, LLC (GLNG) received a Notice of Arbitration from Eni USA Gas Marketing LLC (Eni USA), one of two companies that entered into a terminal use agreement for capacity of the Gulf LNG Facility in Mississippi for an initial term that was not scheduled to expire until the year 2031.  Eni USA is an indirect subsidiary of Eni S.p.A., a multi-national integrated energy company headquartered in Milan, Italy.  Pursuant to its Notice of Arbitration, Eni USA sought declaratory and monetary relief based upon its assertion that (i) the terminal use agreement should be terminated because changes in the U.S. natural gas market since the execution of the agreement in December 2007 have “frustrated the essential purpose” of the agreement and (ii) activities allegedly undertaken by affiliates of Gulf LNG Holdings Group LLC “in connection with a plan to convert the LNG Facility into a liquefaction/export facility have given rise to a contractual right on the part of Eni USA to terminate” the agreement.  On June 29, 2018, the arbitration panel delivered its Award, and the panel's ruling called for the termination of the agreement and Eni USA's payment of compensation to GLNG.  The Award resulted in our recording a net loss in the second quarter of 2018 of our equity investment in GLNG due to a non-cash impairment of our investment in GLNG partially offset by our share of earnings recognized by GLNG.  On February 1,\n131\n2019, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued a Final Order and Judgment confirming the Award, which was paid by Eni USA on February 20, 2019.\nOn September 28, 2018, GLNG filed a lawsuit against Eni S.p.A. in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in New York County to enforce a Guarantee Agreement entered into by Eni S.p.A. in connection with the terminal use agreement.  On December 12, 2018, Eni S.p.A. filed a counterclaim seeking unspecified damages from GLNG.  This lawsuit remains pending.\nOn June 3, 2019, Eni USA filed a second Notice of Arbitration against GLNG asserting the same breach of contract claims that had been asserted in the first arbitration and alleging that GLNG negligently misrepresented certain facts or contentions in the first arbitration.  By its second Notice of Arbitration, Eni USA sought to recover as damages some or all of the payments made by Eni USA to satisfy the Final Order and Judgment of the Court of Chancery.  In response to the second Notice of Arbitration, GLNG filed a complaint with the Court of Chancery together with a motion seeking to permanently enjoin the arbitration.  On January 10, 2020, the Court of Chancery entered an Order and Final Judgment granting GLNG’s motion to enjoin arbitration of the negligent misrepresentation claim, but denying the motion to enjoin arbitration of the breach of contract claims. The parties filed cross appeals of the Final Judgment.  On November 17, 2020, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in favor of GLNG and a permanent injunction was entered prohibiting Eni USA from re-arbitrating both the breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation claims.\nOn December 20, 2019, GLNG’s remaining customer, Angola LNG Supply Services LLC (ALSS), filed a Notice of Arbitration seeking a declaration that its terminal use agreement should be deemed terminated as of March 1, 2016 on substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in the arbitration award pertaining to Eni USA.  ALSS also seeks a declaration that activities allegedly undertaken by affiliates of Gulf LNG Holdings Group LLC in connection with the pursuit of an LNG liquefaction export project have given rise to a contractual right on the part of ALSS to terminate the agreement.  ALSS also seeks a monetary award directing GLNG to reimburse ALSS for all reservation charges and operating fees paid by ALSS after December 31, 2016 plus interest. A final decision in this arbitration is expected before the end of the third quarter of 2021.\nGLNG intends to continue to vigorously prosecute and defend all of the foregoing proceedings.\nContinental Resources, Inc. v. Hiland Partners Holdings, LLC\nOn December 8, 2017, Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR) filed an action in Garfield County, Oklahoma state court alleging that Hiland Partners Holdings, LLC (Hiland Partners) breached a Gas Purchase Agreement, dated November 12, 2010, as amended (GPA), by failing to receive and purchase all of CLR’s dedicated gas under the GPA (produced in three North Dakota counties).  CLR also alleged fraud, maintaining that Hiland Partners promised the construction of several additional facilities to process the gas without an intention to build the facilities.  Hiland Partners denied these allegations, but the parties entered into a settlement agreement in June 2018, under which CLR agreed to release all of its claims in exchange for Hiland Partners’ construction of\n10\ninfrastructure projects by November 1, 2020.  CLR has filed an amended petition in which it asserts that Hiland Partners’ failure to construct certain facilities by specific dates nullifies the release contained in the settlement agreement.  CLR’s amended petition makes additional claims under both the GPA and a May 8, 2008 gas purchase contract covering additional North Dakota counties, including CLR’s contention that Hiland Partners is not allowed to deduct third-party processing fees from the gas purchase price.  CLR seeks damages in excess of $\n225\nmillion.  Hiland Partners denies and will vigorously defend against these claims.\nPipeline Integrity and Releases\nFrom time to time, despite our best efforts, our pipelines experience leaks and ruptures.  These leaks and ruptures may cause explosions, fire, and damage to the environment, damage to property and/or personal injury or death.  In connection with these incidents, we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines and/or to properly maintain our pipelines.  Depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident, state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil and/or criminal fines and penalties.\nGeneral\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total reserve for legal matters was $\n273\nmillion and $\n203\nmillion, respectively.\n132\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions from time to time.  In particular, CERCLA generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and predecessor owners and operators of a site, among others, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, subject to the right of a liable party to establish a “reasonable basis” for apportionment of costs.  Our operations are also subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment.  Although we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, risks of additional costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline, terminal and CO\n2\nfield and oil field operations, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities.  Moreover, it is possible that other developments could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies under the terms of authority of those laws, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations.\nWe are currently involved in several governmental proceedings involving alleged violations of local, state and federal environmental and safety regulations.  As we receive notices of non-compliance, we attempt to negotiate and settle such matters where appropriate.  These alleged violations may result in fines and penalties, but we do not believe any such fines and penalties will be material to our business, individually or in the aggregate.  We are also currently involved in several governmental proceedings involving groundwater and soil remediation efforts under state or federal administrative orders or related remediation programs.  We have established a reserve to address the costs associated with the remediation efforts.\nIn addition, we are involved with and have been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in several federal and state Superfund sites.  Environmental reserves have been established for those sites where our contribution is probable and reasonably estimable.  In addition, we are from time to time involved in civil proceedings relating to damages alleged to have occurred as a result of accidental leaks or spills of refined petroleum products, NGL, natural gas or CO\n2\n.\nPortland Harbor Superfund Site, Willamette River, Portland, Oregon\nOn January 6, 2017, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) that established a final remedy and cleanup plan for an industrialized area on the lower reach of the Willamette River commonly referred to as the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (PHSS).  The cost for the final remedy is estimated by the EPA to be approximately $\n1.1\nbillion and active cleanup is expected to take as long as\n13\nyears to complete.  KMLT, KMBT, and\n90\nother PRPs identified by the EPA are involved in a non-judicial allocation process to determine each party’s respective share of the cleanup costs related to the final remedy set forth by the ROD.  We are participating in the allocation process on behalf of KMLT (in connection with its ownership or operation of\ntwo\nfacilities acquired from GATX Terminals Corporation) and KMBT (in connection with its ownership or operation of\ntwo\nfacilities).  Effective January 31, 2020, KMLT entered into separate Administrative Settlement Agreements and Orders on Consent (ASAOC) to complete remedial design for two distinct areas within the PHSS associated with KMLT’s facilities. The ASAOC obligates KMLT to pay a share of the remedial design costs for cleanup activities related to these two areas as required by the ROD.  Our share of responsibility for the PHSS costs will not be determined until the ongoing non-judicial allocation process is concluded or a lawsuit is filed that results in a judicial decision allocating responsibility.  Until the allocation process is completed, we are unable to reasonably estimate the extent of our liability for the costs related to the design of the proposed remedy and cleanup of the PHSS. In addition to CERCLA cleanup costs, we are reviewing and will attempt to settle, if possible, natural resource damage (NRD) claims asserted by state and federal trustees following their natural resource assessment of the PHSS.  At this time, we are unable to reasonably estimate the extent of our potential NRD liability.\nUranium Mines in Vicinity of Cameron, Arizona\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Rare Metals Inc., a historical subsidiary of EPNG, mined approximately\n20\nuranium mines in the vicinity of Cameron, Arizona, many of which are located on the Navajo Indian Reservation.  The mining activities were in response to numerous incentives provided to industry by the U.S. to locate and produce domestic sources of uranium to support the Cold War-era nuclear weapons program.  In May 2012, EPNG received a general notice letter from the EPA notifying EPNG of the EPA’s investigation of certain sites and its determination that the EPA considers EPNG to be a PRP within the meaning of CERCLA.  In August 2013, EPNG and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent and Scope of Work pursuant to which EPNG is conducting environmental assessments of the mines and the immediate vicinity.  On September 3, 2014, EPNG filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona seeking cost recovery and contribution from the applicable federal government agencies toward the cost of environmental activities associated with the mines. The U.S. District Court issued an order on April 16, 2019 that allocated\n35\n% of past and future response costs to the U.S. The decision does not provide or establish the scope of a remedial plan with respect to the sites, nor does it establish the total cost for addressing the sites, all of which remain to be determined in subsequent proceedings and adversarial actions, if necessary, with the EPA.  Until such issues are determined, we are unable to reasonably estimate the extent of our potential\n133\nliability.  Because costs associated with any remedial plan approved by the EPA are expected to be spread over at least several years, we do not anticipate that our share of the costs of the remediation will have a material adverse impact to our business.\nLower Passaic River Study Area of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, New Jersey\nEPEC Polymers, Inc. (EPEC Polymers) and EPEC Oil Company Liquidating Trust (EPEC Oil Trust), former El Paso Corporation entities now owned by KMI, are involved in an administrative action under CERCLA known as the Lower Passaic River Study Area (Site) concerning the lower\n17\n-mile stretch of the Passaic River. It has been alleged that EPEC Polymers and EPEC Oil Trust may be PRPs under CERCLA based on prior ownership and/or operation of properties located along the relevant section of the Passaic River. EPEC Polymers and EPEC Oil Trust entered into two Administrative Orders on Consent (AOCs) with the EPA which obligate them to investigate and characterize contamination at the Site. They are also part of a joint defense group of approximately\n44\ncooperating parties, referred to as the Cooperating Parties Group (CPG), which is directing and funding the AOC work required by the EPA.  Under the first AOC, the CPG submitted draft remedial investigation and feasibility studies (RI/FS) of the Site to the EPA in 2015, and EPA approval remains pending.  Under the second AOC, the CPG conducted a CERCLA removal action at the Passaic River Mile 10.9, and is obligated to conduct EPA-directed post-remedy monitoring in the removal area.  We have established a reserve for the anticipated cost of compliance with these two AOCs.\nOn March 4, 2016, the EPA issued its Record of Decision (ROD) for the lower\neight\nmiles of the Site.  At that time the final cleanup plan in the ROD was estimated by the EPA to cost $\n1.7\nbillion.  On October 5, 2016, the EPA entered into an AOC with Occidental Chemical Company (OCC), a member of the PRP group requiring OCC to spend an estimated $\n165\nmillion to perform engineering and design work necessary to begin the cleanup of the lower\neight\nmiles of the Site.  The design work is underway.  Initial expectations were that the design work would take\nfour years\nto complete.  The cleanup is expected to take at least\nsix years\nto complete once it begins.\nIn addition, the EPA and numerous PRPs, including EPEC Polymers, are engaged in an allocation process for the implementation of the remedy for the lower\neight\nmiles of the Site.  That process was completed December 28, 2020. We anticipate the PRPs, including EPEC Polymers, will engage in further discussions with the EPA during 2021. There remains significant uncertainty as to the implementation and associated costs of the remedy set forth in the ROD. There is also uncertainty as to the impact of the EPA FS directive for the upper nine miles of the Site not subject to the lower eight mile ROD.  In a letter dated October 10, 2018, the EPA directed the CPG to prepare a streamlined FS for the Site that evaluates interim remedy alternatives for sediments in the upper nine miles of the Site.  Until the PRPs engage in discussions with the EPA, the FS is completed, and the RI/FS is finalized, we are unable to reasonably estimate the extent of our potential liability.\nLouisiana Governmental Coastal Zone Erosion Litigation\nBeginning in 2013, several parishes in Louisiana and the City of New Orleans filed separate lawsuits in state district courts in Louisiana against a number of oil and gas companies, including TGP and SNG. In these cases, the parishes and New Orleans, as Plaintiffs, allege that certain of the defendants’ oil and gas exploration, production and transportation operations were conducted in violation of the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended (SLCRMA) and that those operations caused substantial damage to the coastal waters of Louisiana and nearby lands.  The Plaintiffs seek, among other relief, unspecified money damages, attorneys’ fees, interest, and payment of costs necessary to restore the affected areas.  There are more than\n40\nof these cases pending in Louisiana against oil and gas companies,\none\nof which is against TGP and\none\nof which is against SNG, both described further below.\nOn November 8, 2013, the Parish of Plaquemines, Louisiana filed a petition for damages in the state district court for Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana against TGP and\n17\nother energy companies, alleging that the defendants’ operations in Plaquemines Parish violated SLCRMA and Louisiana law, and caused substantial damage to the coastal waters and nearby lands.  Plaquemines Parish seeks, among other relief, unspecified money damages, attorney fees, interest, and payment of costs necessary to restore the allegedly affected areas.  In May 2018, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In May 2019, the case was remanded to the state district court for Plaquemines Parish.  At the same time, the U.S. District Court certified a federal jurisdiction issue for review by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 10, 2020, the Fifth Circuit affirmed remand. The defendants filed a motion for rehearing which is pending.  The case remains effectively stayed pending a final ruling by the Court of Appeals.  Until these and other issues are determined, we are not able to reasonably estimate the extent of our potential liability, if any.  We will continue to vigorously defend this case.\nOn March 29, 2019, the City of New Orleans and Orleans Parish (collectively, Orleans) filed a petition for damages in the state district court for Orleans Parish, Louisiana against SNG and\n10\nother energy companies alleging that the defendants’ operations in Orleans Parish violated the SLCRMA and Louisiana law, and caused substantial damage to the coastal waters and\n134\nnearby lands.  Orleans seeks, among other relief, unspecified money damages, attorney fees, interest, and payment of costs necessary to restore the allegedly affected areas. In April 2019, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  In May 2019, Orleans moved to remand the case to the state district court.  In January 2020, the U.S. District Court ordered the case to be stayed and administratively closed pending the resolution of issues in a separate case to which SNG is not a party;\nParish of Cameron vs. Auster Oil & Gas, Inc.\n, pending in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana; after which either party may move to re-open the case.  Until these and other issues are determined, we are not able to reasonably estimate the extent of our potential liability, if any.  We will continue to vigorously defend this case.\nLouisiana Landowner Coastal Erosion Litigation\nBeginning in January 2015, several private landowners in Louisiana, as Plaintiffs, filed separate lawsuits in state district courts in Louisiana against a number of oil and gas pipeline companies, including\ntwo\ncases against TGP,\ntwo\ncases against SNG, and\ntwo\ncases against both TGP and SNG.  In these cases, the Plaintiffs allege that the defendants failed to properly maintain pipeline canals and canal banks on their property, which caused the canals to erode and widen and resulted in substantial land loss, including significant damage to the ecology and hydrology of the affected property, and damage to timber and wildlife.  The Plaintiffs allege the defendants’ conduct constitutes a breach of the subject right of way agreements, is inconsistent with prudent operating practices, violates Louisiana law, and that defendants’ failure to maintain canals and canal banks constitutes negligence and trespass.  The plaintiffs seek, among other relief, unspecified money damages, attorney fees, interest, and payment of costs necessary to return the canals and canal banks to their as-built conditions and restore and remediate the affected property.  The Plaintiffs also seek a declaration that the defendants are obligated to take steps to maintain canals and canal banks going forward.\nOne of these cases filed by Vintage Assets, Inc. and several landowners against SNG, TGP, and another defendant was tried in 2017 to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. On May 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court entered a judgment ruling in favor of the plaintiffs on certain of their contract claims.  The Court stayed the judgment pending appeal.  The parties each filed a separate appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  In October 2018, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  In April 2019 the case was remanded to the state district court for Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana for further proceedings.  On October 2, 2020,  the case was settled for an amount which is not material to our business.  We will continue to vigorously defend the remaining cases.\nGeneral\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcomes, we believe that the resolution of the environmental matters set forth in this note, and other matters to which we and our subsidiaries are a party, will not have a material adverse effect on our business.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have accrued a total reserve for environmental liabilities in the amount of $\n250\nmillion and $\n259\nmillion, respectively.  In addition, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have recorded a receivable of $\n12\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion, respectively, for expected cost recoveries that have been deemed probable.\nAccounting Standards Updates\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848)\nOn March 12, 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “\nReference Rate Reform - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\n”  This ASU provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as the SOFR.  Entities can elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met.  An entity that makes this election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous accounting determination.  Entities can also elect various optional expedients that would allow them to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met.\nOn January 7, 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, “\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope.\n”  This ASU clarifies that all derivative instruments affected by changes to the interest rates used for discounting, margining or contract price alignment (“The Discounting Transition”) are in the scope of ASC 848 and therefore qualify for the available temporary optional expedients and exceptions.  As such, entities that employ derivatives that are the designated hedged item in a hedge relationship where perfect effectiveness is assumed can continue to apply hedge accounting without de-designating the hedging relationship to the extent such derivatives are impacted by the Discounting Transition.\n135\nThe guidance is effective upon issuance and generally can be applied through December 31, 2022.  We are currently reviewing the effect of Topic 848 to our financial statements.\nASU No. 2020-06\nOn August 5, 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, “\nDebt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity.\n”  This ASU (i) simplifies an issuer’s accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating two of the three models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features, (ii) amends diluted EPS calculations for convertible instruments by requiring the use of the if-converted method and (iii) simplifies the settlement assessment entities are required to perform on contracts that can potentially settle in an entity’s own equity by removing certain requirements.  ASU No. 2020-06 will be effective for us for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2022, and earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently reviewing the effect of this ASU to our financial statements.\nSupplemental Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)"
