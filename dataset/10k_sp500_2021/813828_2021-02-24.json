Driven by iconic consumer brands, our portfolio includes CBS, SHOWTIME, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, Smithsonian Channel, CBS All Access (soon to be rebranded Paramount+) and Pluto TV, among others. We deliver the largest share of television audience in the United States (“U.S.”) and one of the industry’s most extensive libraries of television and film titles. In addition to offering innovative streaming services and digital video products, we provide powerful capabilities in production, distribution and advertising solutions.\nThrough the synergistic combination of our studios, networks and streaming businesses, we strategically focus on creating value in three ways. First, we maximize the power of our content by leveraging our extensive intellectual property portfolio across our Company and by focusing on areas with growth potential. Second, we maximize value from our biggest lines of revenue: advertising, affiliate and content licensing. Third, we are accelerating our momentum in streaming by expanding our differentiated ecosystem of free, pay and premium streaming services to capitalize on the global opportunity in streaming. Ahead of the rebranding of CBS All Access as Paramount+, which is scheduled for March 4, 2021, we recently announced an integrated global streaming organization under new leadership to ensure a more holistic approach across our streaming services, more closely align our streaming initiatives globally and enhance our ability to leverage our content portfolio.\nAs part of our ongoing integration strategy since the Merger (as defined below), in early 2020 we conducted a strategic review of our assets to identify and ultimately divest assets that do not fit within our focus on studios, networks and streaming. In connection with that review, in October 2020 we sold CNET Media Group and in November 2020 announced that we entered into an agreement to sell Simon & Schuster, which is expected to close in 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. As a result, Simon & Schuster, which previously comprised our\nPublishing\nsegment (“\nPublishing\n”), is presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe operate through the following segments:\n•\nTV Entertainment\n.\nOur\nTV Entertainment\nsegment (“\nTV Entertainment\n”) operates the CBS Television Network, our domestic broadcast network; CBS Studios and CBS Media Ventures, our television production and syndication operations; our CBS-branded streaming services, including CBS All Access/Paramount+; CBS Sports Network, our cable network focused on college athletics and other sports; and CBS Television Stations, our owned broadcast television stations.\nTV Entertainment\naccounted for approximately 42% of our consolidated revenues in 2020.\n•\nCable Networks.\nOur\nCable Networks\nsegment (“\nCable Networks\n”) operates a portfolio of streaming services, including Pluto TV, a leading free advertising-supported streaming television (“FAST”) service in the U.S., and Showtime Networks’ premium subscription streaming service (“SHOWTIME OTT”); premium subscription cable networks, including SHOWTIME; basic cable networks, including BET, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, Paramount Network and Smithsonian Channel; international extensions of these brands; and our international free-to-air broadcast networks such as Network 10, Channel 5 and Telefe.\nCable Networks\naccounted for approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues in 2020.\n•\nFilmed Entertainment.\nOur\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment (“\nFilmed Entertainment\n”) operates Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation and Paramount Television Studios, and also includes Miramax, a consolidated joint venture.\nFilmed Entertainment\naccounted for approximately 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2020.\nI-1\nWe were organized as a Delaware corporation in 1986.

International publishing includes the international distribution of English-language titles through Simon & Schuster in the U.K., Canada, Australia and India and other distributors, as well as the publication of locally originated titles by its international companies.\nBest-selling titles in 2020 include: Mary Trump’s\nToo Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man\n; Bob Woodward’s\nRage\n; John Bolton’s\nThe Room Where it Happened\n;\nStephen King’s\nIf It Bleeds\nand\nThe Outsider\n; and Cassandra Clare’s\nChain of Gold.\nCOMPETITION\nAll of our businesses operate in highly competitive environments, and compete for creative talent and intellectual property, as well as for audiences and distribution of our content.\nTV Entertainment\n,\nCable Networks\nand\nFilmed Entertainment\ncompete with a variety of media, technology and entertainment companies that have substantial resources to produce and acquire content worldwide, including broadcast networks, basic and premium cable networks, streaming services, film and television studios, production groups, independent producers and syndicators, television stations and television station groups. These segments compete with other content creators for creative talent including producers, directors, actors and writers, as well as for new program ideas and intellectual property and for the acquisition of popular programming. Similarly,\nPublishing\ncompetes with many other publishers for the rights to works by authors, and competition is particularly strong for well-known authors and public personalities.\nOur businesses also face significant competition for audiences from various sources.\nFilmed Entertainment\ncompetes for audiences for its films and television content with releases from other film studios, television producers and streaming services, as well as with other forms of entertainment and consumer spending outlets.\nTV Entertainment\nand\nCable Networks\ncompete for audiences and advertising revenues primarily with other cable and broadcast television networks; streaming services; social media platforms; websites, apps and other online experiences; radio programming; and print media. In addition, our television and basic cable networks businesses face increasing competition from technologies providing digital audio and visual content in ways that allow audiences to consume content of their choosing while avoiding traditional commercial advertising. Moreover, our businesses face competition from the many other entertainment options available to consumers including video games, sports, travel and outdoor recreation.\nWe also face competition for distribution of our content.\nTV Entertainment\nand\nCable Networks\ncompete for distribution of our program services (and receipt of related fees) with other broadcast networks, cable networks and programmers. The CBS Television Network competes with other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations to ensure the effective distribution of network programming\nI-11\nnationwide.\nTV Entertainment\n,\nCable Networks\nand\nFilmed Entertainment\ncompete with studios and other producers of entertainment content for distribution on third-party platforms.\nFor additional information regarding competition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors —\nOur businesses operate in industries that are highly competitive\n.”\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE STRATEGY\nThe media and entertainment industry is uniquely positioned to shape culture, social attitudes and societal outcomes. As a global content company that reaches billions of people, we take seriously the opportunity and responsibility that comes with that reach.\nWe are committed to advancing and strengthening our approach to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) topics to help serve our partners, audiences, employees and shareholders — and to enhance our success as a business. Our approach is grounded in an understanding of where our biggest impacts, risks and opportunities lie.\nViacomCBS is committed to responsible and sustainable business practices, which strengthen our ability to innovate and better serve our partners, audiences and stockholders. In 2020, we built upon the momentum at each of CBS and Viacom and established three pillars for our ESG strategy moving forward: On-Screen Content and Social Impact, Workforce and Culture, and Sustainable Production and Operations. We also published our first companywide Materiality Assessment and our first ESG report. We are committed to continuing to identify, measure, and map the ESG impacts of our global operations and report on those impacts with stakeholders.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe aim to build a culture that attracts and retains the best employees and a workplace where everyone feels welcome, safe and inspired to bring their whole self to work. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 22,109 full-time and part-time employees worldwide, and had approximately 4,231 additional project-based staff on our payroll. We also use other temporary employees in the ordinary course of our business. Our human capital management strategy is intended to address the following areas:\nA Culture of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe seek to foster a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion through a range of partnerships, collaborations, programs and initiatives, some of which are described below.\n•\nWe partner with approximately 70 diversity-focused institutions that are committed to supporting women, BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans and/or persons with disabilities. We have placed a particular focus on organizations advancing the causes of racial justice, anti-hate and social equity on a global basis.\n•\nOur job postings reach an expansive network that includes approximately 70 diversity-focused job boards. We leverage technology with the goal of removing potentially biasing language from our job descriptions and recruitment correspondence.\n•\nWe sponsor internal and external professional development programs and campus-to-career initiatives aimed at underrepresented groups. We nominate and support women and BIPOC employees for leadership training opportunities.\n•\nWe conduct a variety of training and other initiatives designed to educate our employees on unconscious bias, inclusive leadership, allyship, anti-Semitism and anti-racism, which are intended to help disrupt systemic bias and racism in the workplace.\n•\nWe conduct surveys to gather information about our employee population that self-identifies as LGBTQ+ or as having a disability and we provide education across the business intended to address associated stigma.\nI-12\n•\nWe support nine active employee-led Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) with 48 chapters in 14 locations worldwide. Our ERGs provide support for certain business and corporate initiatives.\n•\nWe are a founding participant of the Black Equity at Work Certification, designed to benchmark and index our performance to other companies to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and of the CEO Action for Diversity Pledge.\nOf our U.S. employees, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 49% were female and approximately 37% self-identified as part of a racial or ethnic minority group. Of our U.S. employees with Vice President titles and above, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 48% were female and approximately 26% self-identified as part of a racial or ethnic minority group. We have set measurable goals intended to improve the diversity of our workforce through hiring and promotions.\nPreventing Harassment and Discrimination\nWe have enacted policies addressing harassment, discrimination and other behaviors that could create a hostile workplace, some of which are described below.\n•\nWe make available to our employees, globally, training on preventing sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation. We also make available to workers on ViacomCBS productions, including freelancers and others not directly employed by ViacomCBS, training on preventing sexual harassment.\n•\nWe monitor employee diversity data for trends that could suggest discrimination or unconscious bias.\n•\nWe expect employees to report any violations of Company policies, including sexual harassment, they witness. Among other ways, employees can report incidents of harassment using our anonymous complaint and reporting hotline, called OPENLINE.\nEmployee Attraction, Retention and Training\nWe provide a range of training, mentoring and career mobility programs aimed at attracting, retaining and engaging our employees. Some of these programs are described below.\n•\nWe offer our employees formal, six-month mentoring programs and “pop up” mentoring events. We also offer our employees leadership-specific training.\n•\nWe offer a range of financial and nonfinancial compensation and benefits, including health, life and disability insurance; matching retirement contributions; flexible paid time off; and paid volunteer time. In 2020, we implemented new parental, caregiving, bereavement and military leave benefits. We also offer tuition support for certain employees.\n•\nWe offer flexible work hours for many of our full-time and part-time employees.\nHealth, Safety and Security\nWe endeavor to take a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating health, safety and security risks. Some of the steps we take are described below.\n•\nWe have on-site health care at some office and production sites, as well as medics and medical support at many production sites.\n•\nWe perform risk assessments of daily work processes across our productions, offices and other work sites and develop hazard reduction, avoidance and mitigation plans. We also track and report safety, health and security incident data across the Company.\nI-13\n•\nOur Global Security Operations Center oversees security and emergency response efforts and undertakes risk scans in an effort to identify potential security risks.\n•\nEarly in the COVID-19 pandemic, we closed our offices and productions out of an abundance of caution and concern for the safety of our workforce. While our workforce continues to be predominantly remote, we restarted some productions beginning in mid-2020 in accordance with local requirements. We also committed $100 million to help provide support to those impacted by COVID-19.\nSocial Impact and Corporate Social Responsibility\nThe content we produce both reflects and shapes culture and influences how people perceive and understand important issues. We endeavor to earn our viewers’ trust through a variety of practices, and we are focused on using our platforms to create positive social impacts.\nUsing our platforms for good includes community projects, philanthropy and employee engagement. Across the organization, we focus our social impact efforts on such issues as civic engagement, social justice, mental health, and diversity and inclusion, among others, and our brands also have strategic focus areas based on their diverse audiences and unique strengths. For example, we heighten social awareness on important issues through CBS Cares public service announcement campaigns, produce arts education programming for students through Paramount Animation’s Arts Matter initiative, and partner with social justice organizations to disseminate content that will combat systemic racism and inequality through BET’s Content for Change initiative. Our focus is also on our audiences: we spread messages to keep our audiences safe and informed from the earliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic with our award-winning #AloneTogether campaign, recruited hundreds of thousands of new poll workers and millions of new early voters with our civic engagement initiatives such as the Vote for Your Life and Reclaim Your Vote campaigns, and are bringing the entertainment industry together for a collaboration to transform mental-health storytelling with a first-of-its-kind Mental Health Media Guide for content creators.\nREGULATION\nOur businesses and the intellectual property they create or acquire are subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as laws and regulations of countries other than the U.S. and pan-national bodies such as the European Union (“E.U.”). The laws and regulations affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change, as are the protections that those laws and regulations afford us. The discussion below describes certain, but not all, present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.\nFCC and Similar Regulation\nThe FCC regulates broadcast television, and some aspects of cable network programming and certain programming in the U.S. delivered by internet protocol, pursuant to U.S. federal law, including the Communications Act. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary fines, the imposition of reporting obligations, limited renewals of licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license.\nLicense Renewals\nEach of our owned television stations in the U.S. must be licensed by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are typically granted for eight-year terms, and we must obtain renewals as they expire to continue operating our stations. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that (1) the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (2) with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations by the licensee of either the Communications Act or FCC regulations; and (3) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. As of February 22, 2021, we had four pending renewal applications, and we will be filing applications with respect to most of our remaining stations on a staggered basis between 2021 and 2023. A station remains authorized to operate while its license renewal application is pending. In addition, the\nI-14\nCommunications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC licensee.\nBroadcast Ownership Regulation\nThe Communications Act and FCC regulations impose limitations on local and national broadcast television ownership in the U.S. The following broadcast ownership rules are the most relevant to our operations. In 2019, a federal appellate court vacated an FCC decision issued in 2017 that would have relaxed some of the broadcast ownership rules. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing that decision, the outcome of which could have significant implications for the FCC’s broadcast ownership regulatory framework.\nLocal Television Ownership.\nThe FCC’s local television ownership rule limits the number of full-power television stations that may be commonly owned in the same DMA. For example, common ownership of two full-power stations in a market generally is allowed only if, at the time the common ownership is created, at least eight independently owned and operating full-power stations remain in the market, and at least one of the owned stations is outside of the top-four ranked stations in the market based on audience share.\nDual Network Rule.\nThe dual network rule prohibits any of the four major U.S. broadcast networks — ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC — from combining or being under common control.\nTelevision National Audience Reach Limitation.\nUnder the national television ownership rule, one party may not own television stations that reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. However, for purposes of this rule, a UHF station is afforded a “discount” and is therefore attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its market. We currently own and operate television stations that reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households, but we are attributed with reaching 25% of all such households for purposes of the national ownership rule because of the discount.\nForeign Ownership.\nIn general, the Communications Act restricts foreign individuals or entities from collectively owning more than 25% of our voting power or equity. FCC approval is required to exceed the 25% threshold. The FCC has recently approved foreign ownership levels of up to 100% in certain instances, subsequent to its review and approval of specific, named foreign individuals.\nCable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by cable system operators, direct broadcast satellite operators, and other MVPDs in the U.S. Pursuant to these regulations, we have elected to negotiate with MVPDs for the right to carry our broadcast television stations via retransmission consent agreements. The Communications Act and FCC regulations require that broadcasters and some types of MVPDs negotiate in good faith for retransmission consent. Some MVPDs have sought changes to federal law that would eliminate or otherwise limit the ability of broadcasters to obtain fair compensation for the grant of retransmission consent.\nProgram Regulation\nThe FCC also regulates the content of broadcast, cable network, and other video programming. The FCC prohibits broadcasters from airing obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. The FCC’s maximum forfeiture penalty per station for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is approximately $419,000 per indecent or profane utterance or image, with a maximum forfeiture exposure of approximately $3.87 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. The FCC also actively monitors compliance with requirements that apply to broadcasters and cable networks relating to political advertising, identification of program sponsors, and the use and integrity of the Emergency Alert System. In addition, FCC regulations require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming, as well as certain programming in the U.S. delivered by internet protocol, among other requirements intended to ensure that video programming is accessible to persons with disabilities.\nI-15\nChildren’s Programming\nOur business is subject to various regulations in the U.S. and abroad applicable to children’s programming. U.S. federal law and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast television stations and cable networks during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and the FCC also limits the display of certain commercial website addresses during children’s programming. Moreover, each of our broadcast television stations is required to air, in general, three hours per week of educational and informational programming designed for children 16 years of age and younger.\nIn addition, some policymakers have sought limitations on food and beverage marketing in media popular with children and teens. For example, restrictions on the television advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (“HFSS”) to children aged 15 and under have been in place in the U.K. since 2007. The U.K. government is currently considering tighter controls, including a ban on all HFSS advertising before 9:00 p.m. Various laws with similar objectives have also been enacted in Ireland, Turkey, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Taiwan and South Korea, and significant pressure for similar restrictions continues to be felt globally, most acutely in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, India, Hungary, Singapore, South Africa and France. The implementation of these or similar limitations and restrictions could have a negative impact on our\nCable Networks\nadvertising revenues, particularly for our networks with programming for children and teens.\nBroadcast Transmission Standard\nIn 2017, the FCC adopted rules to permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the “Next Generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also called “ATSC 3.0.” Those full-service television stations using the new standard are subject to certain requirements, including the obligation to continue broadcasting a generally identical program stream in the current ATSC 1.0 broadcast standard. The ATSC 3.0 standard can be used to offer better picture quality and improved mobile broadcast viewing. A television station converting to ATSC 3.0 operation will incur significant costs in equipment purchases and upgrades. In addition, consumers may be required to obtain new television sets or other equipment that are capable of receiving ATSC 3.0 broadcasts. We are participating in ATSC 3.0 partnerships with other broadcasters and may enter into additional partnerships in the future.\nGlobal Data Protection Laws and Children’s Privacy Laws\nA number of data protection laws impact, or may impact, the manner in which ViacomCBS collects, processes and transfers personal data. In the E.U., the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) mandates data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significant fines for noncompliance, requiring extensive compliance resources and efforts on our part. Further, a number of other regions where we do business, including the U.S., Asia and Latin America, have enacted or are considering new data protection regulations that may impact our business activities that involve the processing of personal data. For example, in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, creates a host of new obligations for businesses regarding how they handle the personal information of California residents, including creating new data access, data deletion and opt out rights. In addition, some of the mechanisms ViacomCBS relies upon for the transfer of personal data from the E.U. to the U.S., such as utilizing standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, have been subject to legal challenges, and the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, which permits the transfer of personal data from the E.U. to the U.S., has been challenged by the relevant E.U. authorities. The outcomes of these proceedings continue to be uncertain and will require changes to our international data transfer mechanisms.\nIn addition, we are subject to other laws and regulations intended specifically to protect the interests of children, including the privacy of minors online. The U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) limits the collection by operators of websites or online services of personal information online from children under the age of 13. In July 2019, the Federal Trade Commission initiated a review of its regulations implementing COPPA, which we anticipate will be updated to address changes in technology. In the E.U., GDPR also limits our ability to process data from children under the age of 16. Such regulations also restrict the types of advertising we are able to sell on these sites and apps and impose strict liability on us for certain actions of ViacomCBS, advertisers and\nI-16\nother third parties, which could affect advertising demand and pricing. Recently, laws in Brazil and China that govern the processing of children’s data also went into effect. These laws will likely have similar impacts to COPPA and GDPR, especially with respect to data collected in connection with advertising. State and federal policymakers are also considering regulatory and legislative methods to protect consumer privacy on the internet, and these efforts have focused particular attention on children and teens.\nCompliance with enhanced data protection laws, which may be inconsistent with one another, requires additional resources and efforts on our part, and noncompliance with personal data protection regulations could result in increased regulatory enforcement and significant monetary fines or private litigation.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe are fundamentally a content company, and the trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property laws that protect our brands and content are extremely important to us.\nIt is our practice to protect our films, programs, content, brands, formats, characters, games, publications and other original and acquired works, and ancillary goods and services. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution, exhibition or other exploitation of copyrighted material interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to distribute and monetize our content. The infringement of our intellectual property rights in films, television and digital programming, books, consumer products and other entertainment content presents a significant challenge to our industry, and we take a number of steps to address this concern. For example, where possible, we use technologies, such as encryption, watermarking, and digital rights management tools, to protect our content from piracy and infringement. We are also actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, including: monitoring online destinations that distribute or otherwise infringe our content and sending takedown or cease and desist notices in appropriate circumstances; using filtering technologies employed by some social networks and other platforms hosting our content; working with intermediaries and other third parties to address current infringements and prevent more in the future; and pursuing litigation and referrals to law enforcement with respect to websites and other online platforms that distribute or facilitate the distribution and exploitation of our content without authorization. Through partnerships with various organizations, we also are actively involved in educational outreach to the creative community, state and federal government officials and other stakeholders in an effort to marshal greater resources to combat intellectual property infringement. Additionally, we participate in various industry-wide enforcement initiatives, public relations programs and legislative activities on a worldwide basis. For example, we have had notable success with site-blocking efforts in parts of Europe and Asia, which can be effective in steering consumers away from piracy platforms and toward legitimate platforms.\nNotwithstanding these efforts and the many legal protections that exist to combat piracy, the proliferation of content infringement and the technological tools with which to carry out those illicit activities continues to be a challenge. The failure to maintain enhanced legal protections and enforcement tools and to update those tools as threats evolve could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could negatively impact its value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights as we continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content.\nI-17\nOUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nViacomCBS’ executive officers as of February 22, 2021 are as follows:\nRobert M.

    "text": "A wide range of risks may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, now and in the future. We consider the risks described below to be the most significant. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable factors that could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nI-19\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nChanges in consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies, distribution platforms and packaging, may negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur success in the media and entertainment industry depends on our ability to adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption. The ways in which consumers view content, and technology and business models in our industry, continue to evolve rapidly, and new distribution platforms, as well as increased competition from new entrants and emerging technologies, have added to the complexity of maintaining predictable revenue streams.\nTechnological advancements have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and have affected the options available to advertisers for reaching their target audiences. The evolution of consumer preferences towards digital and other subscription services, and the substantial increase in availability of programming without advertising or adequate methodologies for audience measurement, have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, consumers are increasingly using time-shifting and advertising-blocking technologies that enable users to fast-forward or circumvent advertisements, such as DVRs, or increase the sharing of subscription content and reduce the demand for electronic sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray disc products. Substantial use of these technologies could impact the attractiveness of our programming to advertisers, adversely affecting our advertising revenue. Our business also may be adversely affected by the use of antennas (and their integration with set-top boxes or other consumer devices) to access broadcast signals to avoid subscriptions, as well as live and stored video streaming boxes and services, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages.\nIn response to perceived consumer demand, distributors of programming and program services are continuing to develop alternative offerings for consumers, including SVOD and other subscription services; FAST services; and original content for mobile and social media platforms. Also, the impact of technological changes on MVPDs may adversely affect our cable networks’ ability to grow revenue. If our networks and brands are not included in these offerings and services, or if consumers increasingly favor alternative offerings over traditional broadcast television and cable subscriptions, we may continue to experience a decline in viewership and ultimately demand for our programming, which could lead to lower revenues. These changing distribution models may also impact our ability to negotiate carriage deals on terms favorable to us, thereby having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn order to respond to these developments, we regularly adopt or develop new technologies and consider, and from time to time implement, changes to our business models and strategies to remain competitive, such as our focus on streaming, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully anticipate or respond to these developments, that we will not experience disruption, even as we respond to such developments, or that the new technologies or business models we develop will be as successful as our current technology and business models.\nOur advertising revenues have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in consumers’ content viewership, deficiencies in audience measurement and advertising market conditions\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and a decline in advertising revenues could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nConsumers are increasingly turning to “over-the-top” sources for viewing and purchasing content, and an increasing number of companies offer SVOD and/or FAST services, including some that offer exclusive high-quality original programming delivered over the internet. The increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and reduced the viewing of content through traditional linear distribution models, which has caused, and may continue to cause, ratings declines for broadcast and cable networks. This decline may adversely affect the amount of advertising dollars invested in broadcast and cable networks. Although we expect our digital advertising products in both local and national markets (through\nI-20\ndirect and automated transactional models) to provide some offsetting benefit, increased advertising investment in digital offerings could adversely affect our advertising volume in linear.\nIn addition, advertising sales are largely dependent on audience measurement, and the results of audience measurement techniques can vary for a variety of reasons, including the platforms on which viewing is measured and variations in statistical sampling methods used. While Nielsen’s statistical sampling method is the primary measurement technique used in our television advertising sales, we measure and monetize across over-the-top platforms based on census-based advertising-server data establishing the number of impressions served, combined with third-party data providing demographic composition estimates. Multiplatform campaign verification remains in its infancy and is still not measured by any one consistently applied method. While we expect innovation and standards around multiplatform measurement to benefit us as the video advertising market continues to evolve, we are nevertheless partially dependent on third parties to deliver those solutions.\nThe strength of the advertising market can fluctuate in response to the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, advertisers’ current spending priorities and the economy in general or the economy of any individual geographic market, and this may adversely affect our advertising revenues. Natural and other disasters, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could lead to a reduction in domestic and international advertising expenditures as a result of disrupted programming and services, uninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty. In 2020, we experienced a material negative impact on advertising revenues because of weakness in the advertising market as a result of COVID-19. Our ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for our content, the consumers in our targeted demographics, advertising rates and results observed by advertisers.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain attractive brands and\nour reputation, and to offer popular programming and other content\nOur ability to maintain attractive brands, and to create, distribute and/or license popular content are key to our success and ability to generate revenues. The revenues we generate primarily depend on our ability to anticipate and consistently satisfy consumer tastes and expectations, both in the U.S. and internationally. The popularity of our content is affected by our ability to develop and maintain strong brand awareness and a strong reputation; our ability to target key audiences; the quality and attractiveness of competing entertainment content; and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities. Audience tastes change frequently, and it is a challenge to anticipate what will be successful at any point in time. We invest substantial capital in creating and promoting our content, including in the production of original content, before learning the extent to which it will garner critical success and popularity with consumers. A shortfall in the expected popularity of content we expect to distribute or of sports events for which we have acquired rights, could lead to decreased profitability or losses for a significant period of time. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners and culture, including individuals associated with the content we create and/or license, as well as our inability to adequately respond to such negative claims or publicity, may damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. A lack of popularity of our offerings or damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in a particular period or over a longer term.\nIncreased costs for programming, films and other rights, and judgments we make on the potential performance of our content, may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nIn\nTV Entertainment\nand\nCable Networks\n, we produce a significant amount of original programming and other content and we invest significant resources in our brands, in part with the aim of developing higher quality and quantity of original content, and we also derive a portion of our revenue from the exploitation of our extensive library of television programming. In\nFilmed Entertainment\n, we invest significant amounts in the production, marketing and distribution of films and television series. We also acquire programming, films and television series, as well as a variety of digital content and other ancillary rights such as consumer and home entertainment product offerings, and we pay license fees, royalties and/or contingent compensation in connection with these acquired rights. For example, some of CBS Sports’ most widely viewed programming, including The Masters Tournament and NFL games, are made available based on programming rights of varying duration that we have\nI-21\nnegotiated with third parties. We also license various music rights from the major record companies, music publishers and performing rights organizations.\nOur investments in original and acquired programming are significant and involve complex negotiations with numerous third parties, and rapid changes in consumer behavior have increased the risk associated with the success of all kinds of programming. Competition for popular content is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay for talent and intellectual property rights, which may result in significantly increased costs. Further, increased competition in the market for development and production of original content, particularly from streaming services providers, including our streaming services, increases our content costs. We may be outbid by our competitors for the rights to new, popular programming or in connection with the renewals of popular programming that we currently license. Finally, certain of our counterparties and vendors may encounter financial and operational pressures, which could result in increased costs to us or delays in production. As such, there can be no assurance that we will recoup our investments when the content is broadcast or distributed.\nOur businesses operate in industries that are highly competitive\nWe compete with other media companies to attract creative talent and produce high-quality content, and for distribution on a variety of third-party platforms to draw large audiences. Competition for talent, content, audiences, service providers, production infrastructure, advertising and distribution is intense and comes from other broadcast television stations and networks, cable television systems and networks, streaming service providers, the internet and social media platforms, film studios and independent film producers and distributors, consumer products companies and other entertainment outlets and platforms, as well as from search engines, program guides and “second screen” applications. Additionally, other television stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming, a new station or new network may adopt a format to compete directly with our stations or networks, or stations or networks might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns. Further, competition from additional entrants into the market for development and production of original content and streaming services continues to increase.\nOur ability to obtain widespread distribution on favorable terms, which contributes to our ability to attract audiences and, in turn, advertisers, is adversely affected by the consolidation of advertising agencies, programmers, content providers, distributors and television service providers. This consolidation reduces the number of distributors with whom we negotiate and increases the negotiating leverage and market power of the combined companies. Our competitors generally include companies with interests in multiple media businesses that are often vertically integrated, whereas our\nCable Networks\nbusiness generally relies on distribution relationships with third parties. As more cable and satellite operators, internet service providers, telecom companies and other content distributors, aggregators and search providers create or acquire their own content, they may have significant competitive advantages, which could adversely affect our ability to negotiate favorable terms for distribution or otherwise compete effectively in the delivery marketplace. Our competitors could also have preferential access to important technologies, customer data or other competitive information, as well as significant financial resources.\nThis competition and consolidation could result in lower ratings and advertising, lower affiliate and other revenues, and increased content costs and promotional and other expenses, negatively affecting our ability to generate revenues and profitability. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that competition or consolidation in the marketplace will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of distributors, the loss of affiliation and distribution agreements, renewal on less favorable terms or adverse interpretations thereof could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nA significant portion of our revenues are attributable to agreements with a limited number of distributors. These agreements generally have fixed terms that vary by market and distributor, and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future, or renewed on favorable terms, including those related to pricing\nI-22\nand programming tiers. We may also be unable to modify existing agreements with terms that have become less favorable over time. The loss of existing packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing opportunities and the loss of carriage or the failure to renew our agreements with any distributor, or renew or modify them on favorable terms, could reduce the distribution of our programming and program services and decrease the potential audience for our programs, thereby negatively affecting our growth prospects and revenues from both affiliate fees and advertising. CBS Television Network provides affiliated television stations regularly scheduled programming in return for the insertion of network commercials during that programming and the payment of reverse compensation. The loss of such station affiliation agreements could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the reach of our programming and therefore our attractiveness to advertisers, and renewal of these affiliation agreements on less favorable terms may also adversely affect our results of operations.\nConsolidation among and vertical integration of distributors in the cable or broadcast network business has provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect our ability to maintain or obtain distribution for our network programming or distribution and/or marketing of our subscription services on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Also, consolidation among television station group owners could increase their negotiating leverage. Moreover, competitive pressures faced by MVPDs, particularly in light of the lower retail prices of streaming services, could adversely affect the terms of our renewals with MVPDs. In addition, MVPDs and streaming services continue to develop alternative offerings for consumers. To the extent these offerings do not include our programming and become widely accepted in lieu of traditional offerings, we could experience a decline in affiliate revenues.\nOur revenues are dependent on the compliance of major distributors with the terms of our affiliation or distribution agreements. As these agreements have grown in complexity, the number of disputes regarding their interpretation and even their validity has grown, resulting in greater uncertainty and, from time to time, litigation with respect to our rights and obligations. Some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” (“MFN”) clauses, which provide that if we enter into an agreement with a distributor and such agreement includes terms that are more favorable than those held by a distributor holding an MFN right, we must offer some of those terms to the distributor holding the MFN right. Disagreements with a distributor on the interpretation or validity of an agreement could adversely impact our affiliate and advertising revenues, as well as our relationship with that distributor.\nWe could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and programming\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including FCC licenses, for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in advertising markets, a decrease in audience acceptance of our programming or films, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms and/or changes in consumer behavior could result in a downward revision in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible assets, including FCC licenses, which could result in a non-cash impairment charge. Any such impairment charge for goodwill, intangible assets and/or programming could have a material adverse effect on our reported net earnings.\nRisks Relating to the Merger and Other Strategic Initiatives\nThe integration of the CBS and Viacom businesses may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected\n.\nSynergies and other anticipated benefits may not be realized within the expected time frames, or at all.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the businesses of the combined companies in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends without adversely affecting revenues and investments in future growth. The failure to meet the challenges involved in combining CBS’ and Viacom’s businesses following the Merger and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, including expected synergies, could adversely affect the results of operations of ViacomCBS. The overall combination of our businesses may also result in material\nI-23\nunanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customer and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others: the diversion of management attention to integration matters; difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems; challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies; difficulties in integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel, including talent; challenges in retaining existing, and obtaining new customers, viewers, suppliers, distributors, licensors, employees and others, including material content providers, studios, producers, directors, actors, authors and other talent, and advertisers; difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, financing plans and growth prospects from the combination; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company; challenges in continuing to develop valuable and widely accepted content and technologies; contingent liabilities that are larger than expected; and potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the Merger.\nEven if our operations are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Merger, including anticipated synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities, may not be realized, and these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses. Many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs and diversion of management time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have acquired and invested in, and expect to continue to acquire and invest in, new businesses, products, services and technologies as part of our ongoing strategic initiatives. Such acquisitions and strategic initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including the types described above, as well as insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the new investments; unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities; and a failure to successfully develop an acquired business or technology. Because new investments are inherently risky, and the anticipated benefits or value of these investments may not materialize, no assurance can be given that such investments and other strategic initiatives will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our streaming initiatives are unsuccessful, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected\nThere can be no assurance that our streaming initiatives will be successful. The streaming market is intensely competitive and our ability to attract and retain subscribers to our pay streaming services, including Paramount+, SHOWTIME OTT and BET+, and MAUs on our FAST service, Pluto TV, as well as the corresponding subscription and advertising revenues they enable us to generate, will depend on our ability to consistently provide appealing and differentiated content, effectively market these services and provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing that content. Our success will also require significant investments to produce original content and acquire the rights to third-party content, including with respect to live sports, as well as the establishment and maintenance of key content and distribution partnerships. We will need to find the right balance between licensing our content to our own streaming services, forgoing traditional sources of content licensing revenues, and licensing our content to third parties.\nIn addition, the relative service levels, content offerings, promotions, and pricing and related features of our competitors’ services may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers and MAUs. Competitors include MVPDs, vMVPDs and other content providers. If consumers do not consider our streaming services to be of value compared to our competitors’ services, including because we fail to introduce new features, increase our pricing, terminate or modify promotional or trial period offerings, experience technical issues, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received, we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers and MAUs. In addition, many subscribers and MAUs originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing subscribers and MAUs. If we are not be able to attract subscribers and MAUs, or our subscribers or MAUs decide to not continue subscriptions on our services for a variety of reasons, including a perception that they do not use it\nI-24\nsufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, unsatisfactory content, promotions or trial-period offers expire or are modified, competitive services or promotions provide a better value or experience or customer service or technical issues are not satisfactorily resolved, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe must continually add new subscribers and MAUs both to replace canceled subscribers and to grow our business, including offsetting subscriber declines in our traditional linear distribution model. If we are unable to successfully compete with competitors in retaining and attracting new subscribers and MAUs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Business Continuity, Cybersecurity and Privacy and Data Protection\nDisruptions or failures of, or cybersecurity attacks upon, our or our service providers’ networks, information systems and other technologies, and a failure of our business continuity plans in response thereto, could result in the disclosure of confidential or valuable business or personal information, disruption of our businesses, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses\nCloud services, networks, information systems and other technologies we use or that are used by our third-party providers, including technology systems used in connection with the production and distribution of our content (“Systems”), are critical to our business activities, and shutdowns or disruptions of, and cybersecurity attacks on, these Systems pose increasing risks. We also use content delivery networks to help us stream programming, films and other content in high volume to viewers and users of our online, mobile and app offerings over the internet. Shutdowns, disruptions and attacks may be caused by third-party hacking of computers and Systems; dissemination of computer viruses, worms, malware, ransomware and other destructive or disruptive software; denial of service attacks and other bad acts; human error; and power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Shutdowns, disruptions and attacks could have an adverse impact on us, our business partners, employees, advertisers, viewers and users of our content, including degradation or disruption of service, loss of data and damage to equipment and data. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our Systems and network infrastructure, and to otherwise improve the stability and efficiency of our Systems may not be sufficient to avoid shutdowns, disruptions and attacks. Significant events could result in a disruption of our operations and reduction of our revenues, the loss of or damage to the integrity of data used by management to make decisions and operate our businesses, viewer or advertiser dissatisfaction or a loss of viewers or advertisers, and damage to our reputation or brands. In addition, our recovery and business continuity plans may prove inadequate to address any such disruption, failure or cybersecurity attack.\nWe are subject to risks caused by the misappropriation, misuse, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of business or personal data or programming content maintained in our or our third-party providers’ Systems, including proprietary and personal information (of third parties, employees and users of our online, mobile and app offerings), business information including intellectual property, or other confidential information. Outside parties may attempt to penetrate our Systems or those of our third-party providers or fraudulently induce employees, business partners or users of our online, mobile and app offerings to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to our data or our subscribers’ or users’ data, or our programming. The number and sophistication of attempted and successful information security breaches in the U.S. and elsewhere have increased significantly in recent years, and because of our prominence, we and/or third-party providers we use may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or disable, degrade or sabotage, these Systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate security measures or remediate any intrusion on a timely or effective basis. Moreover, the development and maintenance of security measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated.\nIf a material breach of our Systems or those of our third-party providers occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose subscribers, viewers, revenues in the case of leaked content, advertisers and other business partners, and users of our online, mobile and app offerings; our\nI-25\nreputation, brands and credibility could be damaged; and we could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace such Systems or to comply with regulatory requirements. We could also be subject to actions by regulatory authorities and claims asserted in private litigation. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any losses associated with such events.\nWe are subject to complex, often inconsistent and potentially costly laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations relating to privacy and personal data protection\nWe are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries relating to privacy and the collection, use and security of personal data. In the E.U., for example, the GDPR mandates data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significant fines for noncompliance, requiring extensive compliance resources and efforts on our part. Further, a number of other regions where we do business have enacted or are considering new data protection regulations that may impact our business activities. In the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, creates a host of new obligations for businesses regarding how they handle the personal information of California residents. We are also subject to laws and regulations intended specifically to protect the interests of children and the privacy of minors online, including COPPA in the U.S. and the GDPR in the E.U., and we have been required to limit some functionality on digital properties as a result of these regulations. Such regulations also restrict the types of advertising we are able to sell on these digital properties and impose strict liability on us for certain actions of ViacomCBS, advertisers and other third parties, which could affect advertising demand and pricing. Recently, laws in Brazil and China that govern the processing of children’s data also went into effect. These laws will likely have similar impacts to COPPA and GDPR, especially with respect to data collected in connection with advertising. We will continue to expend resources to comply with data protection and privacy standards imposed by law, industry standards or contractual obligations, which may be inconsistent with one another, and despite such efforts we may face regulatory and other legal actions. Each of these factors could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\nInfringement of our content, including digital copyright piracy and other unauthorized uses of our content, reduces revenue received from legitimate distribution of our programming, films, books and other entertainment content and adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations\nThe success of our businesses depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize our intellectual property rights. We are fundamentally a content company and infringement of our content — specifically, the infringement of our films and home entertainment products, television programming, digital content, books and other intellectual property rights — affects the value of our content. Copyright infringement is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that either lack effective laws and technical protection measures similar to those existing in the U.S. and Europe or lack effective enforcement of such measures, or both. Such foreign copyright infringement often creates a supply of pirated content for major markets as well. The interpretation of copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws as applied to our content, and our infringement-detection and enforcement efforts, remain in flux, and some methods of enforcement have encountered political opposition. The failure to appropriately enforce and/or the weakening of existing intellectual property laws could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect and monetize our intellectual property and thus negatively affect its value.\nCopyright piracy is made easier by the wide availability of higher bandwidth and reduced storage costs, as well as tools that undermine encryption and other security features and enable infringers to disguise their identities online. We and our numerous production and distribution partners operate various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming and films, and intentional or unintentional acts could result in unauthorized access to our content. The continuing proliferation of digital formats and technologies heightens this risk. Internet-connected televisions, set-top boxes and mobile devices are ubiquitous, and many can support illegal retransmission platforms, illicit video-on-demand or streaming services and pre-loaded hardware, providing more accessible, versatile and legitimate-looking environments for consuming unlicensed film and television content. Unauthorized access to our content could result in the premature release of films, television programs or other\nI-26\ncontent as well as a reduction in demand for authorized content, which would likely have significant adverse effects on the value of the affected content and our ability to monetize our content.\nCopyright infringement reduces the revenue that we are able to receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content, undermines lawful distribution channels, reduces the public’s and some affiliate partners’ perceived value of our content and inhibits our ability to recoup or profit from the costs incurred to create such content. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, and it is likely that we will continue to expend substantial resources in connection with these initiatives. Efforts to prevent the unauthorized reproduction, distribution and exhibition of our content may affect our profitability and may not be successful in preventing harm to our business.\nRisks Relating to Macroeconomic and Political Conditions\nCOVID-19 and other pandemics could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the macroeconomic environment in the U.S. and globally. Federal, state and local governmental authorities in the U.S. and foreign governments around the world have implemented numerous orders, policies and initiatives to try to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. The difficult macroeconomic environment, which has included increased and prolonged unemployment and a decline in consumer confidence, and any resulting recession or prolonged declines in economic growth, as well as changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other pandemics or widespread health emergencies may have similar effects.\nAs a result of COVID-19, we experienced a material negative impact on our advertising revenues in 2020, particularly at the end of the first quarter and throughout the second quarter, as a result of weakness in the advertising market as advertisers sought to reduce costs in response to the pandemic’s impact on their businesses, the cancellation or postponement of sporting events for which we have broadcast rights, including the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship in the first quarter, and the delay of the 2020-21 television broadcast season as a result of production shutdowns. While the rate of decline improved in the second half of the year, we are not able to predict whether future sporting events will be canceled or postponed, or whether advertising revenues from these broadcasts, or advertising budgets and the advertising market generally, will return or be comparable to historical levels. Any prolonged decline in our advertising revenues would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 had a negative effect on our content licensing revenues in 2020. Temporary television and film production shutdowns resulted in the abandonment of content that was not completed, delays in the delivery of programming to third parties, and fewer original programs and live events airing on our broadcast and cable networks. We also experienced lower demand for the licensing of our content from advertising-supported licensees. While production has resumed, we are not able to predict whether we will encounter future production delays or shutdowns or if and to what extent content licensing revenues will continue to be negatively impacted. Additionally, with the resumption of production we began incurring incremental costs related to health and safety protocols in response to COVID-19, which are expected to continue in 2021.\nOur theatrical revenues have been negatively impacted by the closure or reduction in capacity of movie theaters that show our films as a result of COVID-19, which has impacted our theatrical releases. Accordingly, we have rescheduled certain theatrical releases and licensed others to our owned or third-party streaming services. We are not able to predict when or whether movie theaters will reopen at scale, whether consumers will return at the same levels they previously did because of concerns related to COVID-19 or because of changes to viewing habits, or whether revenues from theatrical releases will be comparable to historical levels.\nIn addition, COVID-19 could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in a number of other ways, including: negatively impacting our affiliate and advertising revenues as consumers reduce\nI-27\ndiscretionary spending by cancelling or forgoing subscriptions to MVPD or vMVPD services; negatively impacting our financial condition or our ability to fund operations, dividends or future investment opportunities due to an increase in the cost or difficulty in obtaining debt or equity financing, or refinancing our debt in the future, our ability to comply with the leverage covenant in our Credit Facility, or a decrease in our debt ratings; impairments of our programming and other inventory, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; and increased cyber and payment fraud risk, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online activity.\nThe magnitude of the continuing impact of COVID-19, which could be material to our business, financial condition and results of operations, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or control, including the duration and extent of the pandemic, the impact of federal, state, local and foreign governmental actions, consumer behavior in response to the pandemic and such governmental actions, and economic and operating conditions in the aftermath of COVID-19. Even after COVID-19 has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. Due to the evolving and uncertain nature of the pandemic, we are not able to estimate the full extent of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and that impact could also exacerbate the other risks described herein.\nPolitical and economic conditions in a variety of markets around the world could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur businesses operate and have audiences, customers and partners worldwide, and we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets, some of which are emerging markets. For that reason, economic conditions in many different markets around the world affect a number of aspects of our businesses. Economic conditions in each market can also impact our audience’s discretionary spending and therefore their willingness to access our content, as well as the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks, causing them to reduce their spending on advertising. We may also be subject to longer payment cycles. In addition, as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar has increased, and there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain stable in any period. Such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Also, volatility and weakness in the capital markets, the tightening of credit markets or a decrease in our debt ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing.\nOur businesses are also exposed to certain political risks inherent in conducting a global business, including retaliatory actions by governments reacting to changes in the U.S. and other countries, including in connection with trade negotiations; issues related to the presence of corruption in certain markets and enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations; increased risk of political instability in some markets as well as conflict and sanctions preventing us from accessing those markets; escalating trade, immigration and nuclear disputes; wars, acts of terrorism or other hostilities; and other political, economic or other uncertainties.\nThese political and economic risks could create instability in any of the markets where our businesses derive revenues, which could result in a reduction of revenue or loss of investment that adversely affects our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nFailures to comply with or changes in U\n.\nS\n.\nor foreign laws or regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and/or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we or our partners operate, including laws and regulations relating to intellectual property, content regulation, user privacy, data protection, anti-corruption, repatriation of profits, tax regimes, quotas, tariffs or other trade barriers, currency exchange controls, operating license and permit requirements, restrictions on foreign ownership or\nI-28\ninvestment, export and market access restrictions, and exceptions and limitations on copyright and censorship, among others.\nThe television broadcasting and cable programming industries in the U.S. are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. For example, we are required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate our television stations and periodically renew them. It cannot be assured that the FCC will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full terms or will not include conditions or qualifications. The non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. We must also comply with extensive FCC limits on the ownership and operation of our television stations and our television networks, which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some television stations.\nOur businesses could be adversely affected by new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws, changes in interpretations of existing laws by courts and regulators and the threat that additional laws or regulations may be forthcoming, as well as our ability to enforce our legal rights. We could be required to change or limit certain of our business practices, which could impact our ability to generate revenues. We could also incur substantial costs to comply with new and existing laws and regulations, or substantial fines and penalties or other liabilities if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations.\nOur liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses could adversely impact our financial conditions\nWe have both recognized and potential liabilities and costs related to discontinued operations and former businesses, certain of which are unrelated to the media business, including leases, guarantees, environmental liabilities, liabilities related to the pensions and medical expenses of retirees, asbestos liabilities, contractual disputes and other pending and threatened litigation. We cannot be assured that our accruals for these matters are sufficient to cover these liabilities in their entirety or any one of these liabilities when it becomes due or at what point any of these liabilities may come due. Therefore, there can be no assurances that these liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating performance or cash flow.\nRisks Relating to Human Capital\nThe loss of key talent could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive teams, and the various creative talent and entertainment personalities with whom we work. We compete for talented executives in a highly-specialized industry, and our ability to attract and retain such individuals may be impacted by our reputation, workplace culture, efforts with respect to diversity and inclusion, the compensation and benefits we provide, and our commitment to effectively managing executive succession. We also employ or contract with several entertainment personalities with loyal audiences and we produce films with highly regarded directors, producers, writers, actors and other talent. These individuals are important to attracting viewers of our content and achieving the success of our programs, films and other content. There can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or will retain their current appeal, or that the costs associated with retaining them or new talent will be reasonable. If we fail to retain these individuals on current terms or if our entertainment personalities lose their current appeal or we fail to attract new talent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we and our business partners engage the services of writers, directors, actors, musicians and other talent, production crew members, trade employees, professional athletes and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Any labor disputes, including lockouts, strikes or work stoppages, may disrupt our operations and cause delays in the production of our programming, which could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and/or operating income.\nI-29\nRisks Relating to our Ownership Structure\nNAI, through its voting control of ViacomCBS, is in a position to control actions that require stockholder approval\nNAI, through its direct and indirect ownership of our Class A Common Stock, has voting control of ViacomCBS. At December 31, 2020, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 79.4% of the shares of our Class A Common Stock outstanding, and approximately 10.2% of the shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock outstanding on a combined basis. Shari E. Redstone, the Chairperson, CEO and President of NAI, serves as non-executive Chair of the ViacomCBS Board of Directors (the “ViacomCBS Board”). Until the death of Mr. Sumner M. Redstone on August 11, 2020, NAI was controlled by Mr. Redstone through the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust (the “SMR Trust”), which owned 80% of the voting interest of NAI, with such voting interest voted solely by Mr. Redstone. Upon Mr. Redstone’s death and in accordance with the terms of the trust agreement governing the SMR Trust and the Continuing Trusts (as defined below), the SMR Trust was succeeded by two continuing trusts (the “Continuing Trusts”), each of which holds 40% of the voting stock of NAI. Under the terms of the trust agreement governing the SMR Trust and the Continuing Trusts, the Continuing Trusts are required to share the same seven voting trustees, who have equal voting power, and each trustee is required to cause each Continuing Trust to vote the NAI shares held by that Continuing Trust in the same manner as the NAI shares held by the other Continuing Trust. Ms. Redstone is one of the seven voting trustees for each Continuing Trust and is one of two voting trustees who are beneficiaries of one of the Continuing Trusts. No member of our management, or other member of our the ViacomCBS Board, is a trustee of either of the Continuing Trusts.\nSubject to the terms of the Governance Agreement dated as of August 13, 2019, which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, NAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require, or may be accomplished by, stockholder approval, including amending ViacomCBS’ bylaws, the election or removal of directors and transactions involving a change of control. For example, the ViacomCBS bylaws provide that:\n•\nthe affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the aggregate voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class, is required for our stockholders to amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any of our bylaws;\n•\nany or all of our directors may be removed from office at any time prior to the expiration of his or her term of office, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of outstanding shares representing at least a majority of all the aggregate voting power of outstanding shares of our Common Stock then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class at a special meeting of our stockholders called expressly for that purpose; provided that during the two-year period following the closing date of the Merger, the removal of our Chief Executive Officer requires the approval of the ViacomCBS Board by the “Requisite Approval” (as defined in the ViacomCBS certificate of incorporation incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); provided further, that during the two-year period following the closing date, NAI and NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC are not permitted to remove any other persons who were members of the ViacomCBS Board at the effective time of the Merger in accordance with the Merger Agreement or who otherwise become members the ViacomCBS Board (other than any of the NAI Affiliated Directors (as defined in the bylaws)) without the Requisite Approval; and\n•\nin accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our stockholders may act by written consent without a meeting if such stockholders hold the number of shares representing not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such actions at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.\nAccordingly, ViacomCBS stockholders who may have different interests are unable to affect the outcome of any such corporate actions for so long as NAI retains voting control. For more information, see the Governance Agreement incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nI-30\nSales of NAI’s shares of ViacomCBS Common Stock, some of which are pledged to lenders, could adversely affect the stock price\nBased on information received from NAI, NAI has pledged to its lenders a portion of shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by NAI. At December 31, 2020, the aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock pledged by NAI to its lenders represented approximately 4.1% of the total outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. If there is a default on NAI’s debt obligations and the lenders foreclose on the pledged shares, the lenders may not effect a transfer, sale or disposition of any pledged shares of our Class A Common Stock unless NAI and its affiliates beneficially own 50% or less of our Class A Common Stock then outstanding or such shares have first been converted into our Class B Common Stock. A sale of the pledged shares could adversely affect our Common Stock share price. In addition, there can be no assurance that at some future time NAI will not sell or pledge additional shares of our Common Stock, which could adversely affect our Common Stock share price."

On December 19, 2019, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.24 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, resulting in total dividends of $150 million. Prior to the Merger, Viacom and CBS each declared a quarterly cash dividend during each of the first three quarters of 2019 and during each of the four quarters of 2018. During the first three quarters of 2019, CBS declared total per share dividends of $.54, resulting in total dividends of $205 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, CBS declared total per share dividends of $.72, resulting in total annual dividends of $274 million. During the first three quarters of 2019, Viacom declared total per share dividends of $.60, resulting in total dividends of $245 million.

We currently expect to continue to pay a regular cash dividend to our stockholders.\nIn November 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including accelerated stock repurchases or privately negotiated transactions). Since then, various increases totaling $16.4 billion have been approved and announced, including most recently, an increase to the share repurchase program to a total availability of $6.0 billion on July 28, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock. Our publicly announced share repurchase program had remaining authorization of $2.36 billion at December 31, 2020.\nAs of February 19, 2021, there were approximately 2,133 record holders of our Class A Common Stock and approximately 29,999 record holders of our Class B Common Stock.\nII-1\nP\nerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return of our Class A and Class B Common Stock with the cumulative total return on the companies listed in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index (“S&P 500”) and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Media and Entertainment Industry Group Index (“S&P 500 Media and Entertainment Index”).

(“Viacom”) merged with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”), with CBS continuing as the surviving company (the “Merger”). At the effective time of the Merger, the combined company changed its name to ViacomCBS Inc. The Merger has been accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control as National Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”) was the controlling stockholder of each of CBS and Viacom (and remains the controlling stockholder of ViacomCBS). Upon the closing of the Merger, the net assets of Viacom were combined with those of CBS at their historical carrying amounts and the companies have been presented on a combined basis for all periods presented.\nII-3\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) pandemic negatively impacted the macroeconomic environment in the United States and globally, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations in 2020.\nWe experienced a material negative impact on our advertising revenues, particularly at the end of the first quarter and throughout the second quarter, as a result of weakness in the advertising market as advertisers sought to reduce costs in response to the pandemic’s impact on their businesses, the cancellation of sporting events for which we have broadcast rights, including the\nNCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship\n(the “NCAA Tournament”) in the first quarter,\nand the delay of the 2020-21 television broadcast season as a result of temporary production shutdowns. The rate of decline was lower in the second half of the year, with sequential improvement in the third and fourth quarters. While we are not able to predict when or if advertising revenue will return to historical levels, we expect that it will be impacted to a lesser extent in 2021.\nCOVID-19 also had a negative effect on our content licensing revenues in 2020. Temporary television and film production shutdowns resulted in the abandonment of content that was not completed, delays in the delivery of programming to third parties, and fewer original programs and live events airing on our broadcast and cable networks. We also experienced lower demand for the licensing of our content from advertising-supported licensees. While production has resumed, we are not able to predict whether we will encounter future production delays or shutdowns, or if and to what extent content licensing revenues will continue to be negatively impacted. Additionally, with the resumption of production we began incurring incremental costs relating to health and safety protocols, which are expected to continue throughout 2021.\nIn addition, our theatrical revenues have been negatively impacted by the closure or reduction in capacity of movie theaters that show our films as a result of COVID-19, which impacted our theatrical releases in 2020. Accordingly, we have rescheduled certain theatrical releases and licensed others to our owned or third-party streaming services. We are not able to predict when or whether movie theaters will reopen at scale, whether consumers will return at the same levels they previously did because of concerns related to COVID-19 or because of changes to viewing habits, or whether revenues from theatrical releases will be comparable to historical levels.\nWhile COVID-19 has negatively impacted parts of our business, we have benefited from increases in subscribers for our subscription streaming services and monthly active users (“MAUs”) for Pluto TV. Additionally, the impact from the lower revenues has been partially mitigated by lower costs as a result of decreases in production and distribution costs, mainly resulting from production shutdowns and fewer theatrical releases; lower advertising and promotion costs; and cost-savings initiatives. We have taken steps to strengthen our financial position during this period of market uncertainty, such as the issuance of long-term debt and redemption of near-term debt discussed under “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and we will continue to actively monitor the potential impact of COVID-19 and related events on the commercial paper and credit markets.\nThe magnitude of the continuing impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or control, including the duration and extent of the pandemic, the impact of federal, state, local and foreign governmental actions, consumer behavior in response to the pandemic and such governmental actions, and economic and operating conditions in the aftermath of COVID-19. Even after COVID-19 has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nDue to the evolving and uncertain nature of the pandemic, we are not able to estimate the full extent of the impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations\n.\nII-4\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOperational Highlights 2020 vs. 2019\n(a) See “\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n” and “\nFree Cash Flow\n” for reconciliations of non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).\nFor 2020, revenues decreased 6% to $25.29 billion from $27.00 billion in 2019, driven by the adverse effects of COVID-19 on our business, including lower demand in the advertising market, the closure or reduction in capacity of movie theaters, the cancellation of live events for which we have the broadcast rights, and production shutdowns. The revenue comparison was also impacted by CBS’ broadcasts in 2019 of annual tentpole sporting events, the Super Bowl and the semifinals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which we have the rights to broadcast on a rotational basis with other networks, including in 2019 and 2021. In addition, the games in the preceding rounds of the NCAA Tournament are shared equally each year between CBS and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (“Turner”). However, the 2020 NCAA Tournament was cancelled as a result of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by a 49% increase in streaming revenues, reflecting growth across our streaming services, including Pluto TV, CBS All Access (to be rebranded as Paramount+ in March 2021), Showtime Networks’ premium subscription streaming service (“Showtime OTT”), and BET+, as well as record political advertising sales.\nOperating income for 2020 remained flat at $4.14 billion. Each year was impacted by items identified as affecting comparability, including programming, restructuring and impairment charges and costs for other corporate matters, as well as a gain on the sale of CNET Media Group (“CMG”) in 2020 and a gain on the sale of the CBS Television City property and sound stage operation (“CBS Television City”) in 2019. See “\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures.\n” Adjusted OIBDA decreased 5%, primarily reflecting the decline in revenues, partially offset by lower expenses as a result of production shutdowns, the absence in 2020 of certain major sporting events, fewer theatrical releases, lower advertising and promotion costs reflecting the broadcast of fewer original programs, and the benefit from cost savings, including from restructuring activities. The lower expenses were partially offset by increased costs to support the growth and expansion of our streaming services.\nFor 2020, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and diluted EPS from continuing operations each decreased 27% from 2019. These comparisons were impacted by items identified as affecting comparability, including the aforementioned items impacting operating income, a loss on extinguishment of debt\nII-5\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nin 2020, net gains from investments, and discrete tax items. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and adjusted diluted EPS each decreased 13%, reflecting the lower Adjusted OIBDA and the noncontrolling interest’s share of profit from the licensing of\nSouth Park\nduring the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations are non-GAAP financial measures. See “\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n” for details of the items excluded from financial results, and reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\nWe generated operating cash flows from continuing operations of $2.22 billion in 2020 compared with $1.17 billion in 2019. Free cash flow was $1.89 billion for 2020 compared with $826 million for 2019. These increases primarily reflect lower spending, including for programming, production, advertising and distribution costs resulting from production shutdowns related to COVID-19 and cost savings, as well as lower payments for income taxes in 2020. These items were partially offset by the decline in revenues and higher payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and costs to achieve synergies. Operating cash flow and free cash flow included payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and costs to achieve synergies which totaled $584 million and $362 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Also included in free cash flow for 2020 are capital expenditures of $40 million associated with costs to achieve synergies. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “\nFree Cash Flow\n” for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nResults for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included certain items identified as affecting comparability. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (together, the “adjusted measures”) exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. In addition, we use Adjusted OIBDA to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. We believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results.\nBecause the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, provision for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS or diluted EPS from continuing operations, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\nII-6\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\n(a) Includes impairment charges of $25 million and $20 million to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets to fair value for 2020 and 2019, respectively. 2020 also includes accelerated depreciation of $12 million for technology that was abandoned in connection with synergy plans related to the Merger.\n(b) See notes on the following tables for additional information on items affecting comparability.\n(a) Reflects severance, exit costs and other costs related to the Merger and a charge to write down property and equipment classified as held for sale.\n(b) Reflects a charge to reduce the carrying values of FCC licenses in two markets to their fair values.\n(c) Reflects accelerated depreciation for technology that was abandoned in connection with synergy plans related to the Merger.\n(d) Programming charges primarily related to the abandonment of certain incomplete programs resulting from production shutdowns related to COVID-19.\n(e) Reflects a gain on the sale of CMG.\n(f) Primarily reflects an increase in the value of our investment in fuboTV, Inc.

Streaming revenues are earned from advertising on our pay and free streaming services, including Pluto TV, CBS All Access (to be rebranded as Paramount+ in March 2021), and CBSN; subscription fees for our pay streaming services, including CBS All Access, Showtime OTT, BET+ and Noggin; and advertising and subscriptions for our other digital video products.\n(a) Subscription streaming revenues are included within affiliate revenues.\n(b) Primarily includes CBS All Access, CBSN and other CBS branded digital video products.\n(c) Primarily includes Pluto TV, Showtime OTT, BET+, Noggin, our international streaming services, and other digital video products.\nIncluded in total streaming revenues are $2.46 billion and $1.63 billion of domestic revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, our global streaming subscribers totaled 29.9 million, which included domestic subscribers of 19.2 million, and global MAUs for Pluto TV were 43.1 million, which included 30.1 million domestic MAUs. Global subscribers include customers who access our domestic or international streaming services, either directly through our owned and operated apps and websites, or through third-party distributors.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenues are generated primarily from the sale of advertising spots on the CBS Television Network, our basic cable networks and our television stations, as well as on our advertising-supported streaming services, and on our websites. Our advertising revenues include integrated marketing services, which provide unique branded content and custom sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers. For 2020, the 12% decrease in advertising revenues was driven by the adverse effects of COVID-19, including lower demand in the advertising market and the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament, as well as the comparison against CBS’ broadcasts in 2019 of annual tentpole sporting events that we have the rights to broadcast on a rotational basis with other networks, the Super Bowl and the national semifinals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament. These decreases were partially offset by 41% growth in advertising from our streaming businesses, led by Pluto TV, as well as record political advertising revenues associated with the U.S. presidential election in 2020.\nIn 2021, the advertising revenue comparison will benefit from the broadcasts of\nSuper Bowl LV\nand the NCAA Tournament. Under the current contract with the NFL, the Super Bowl is broadcast on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks through the 2022 season, with CBS broadcasting these games in 2019 and 2021. Under agreements with the NCAA and Turner, the national semifinals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament are broadcast on CBS every other year through 2032, including in 2019 and 2021, and in each year the games in the preceding rounds of the tournament are shared equally between CBS and Turner.\nII-10\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nHowever, the 2020 NCAA Tournament was cancelled as a result of COVID-19. The benefit from the broadcasts of these sporting events in 2021 will be partially offset by lower political advertising sales.\nFor 2020, domestic advertising revenues decreased 12% to $8.57 billion from $9.72 billion for 2019, and international advertising revenues decreased 13% to $1.18 billion from $1.36 billion for 2019, including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes of 2 percentage points.\nAffiliate\nAffiliate revenues are principally comprised of fees received from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and third-party live television streaming services (“virtual MVPDs” or “vMVPDs”) for carriage of our cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”), fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“reverse compensation”); fees for authorizing the MVPDs’ and vMVPDs’ carriage of our owned television stations (“retransmission fees”); and subscription fees for our streaming services. For 2020, affiliate revenues increased 7% reflecting growth from subscription streaming revenues, higher reverse compensation and retransmission fee revenues, and the launch of our basic cable networks on a vMVPD service. Subscription streaming revenues grew 61% primarily reflecting subscriber growth for CBS All Access and Showtime OTT, and the launch of BET+ in September 2019. Reverse compensation and retransmission fee revenues increased 19%, driven by annual contractual increases and contract renewals with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network, MVPDs and vMVPDs. These increases were partially offset by lower linear affiliate fees for our cable networks from MVPDs, reflecting subscriber declines. For 2020, domestic affiliate revenues increased 7% to $8.52 billion from $7.94 billion for 2019, while international affiliate revenues decreased 3% to $645 million from $665 million for 2019, including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes of 2 percentage points.\nContent Licensing\nContent licensing revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of exhibition rights for our internally-produced television and film programming to cable and broadcast networks, television stations, and subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”) and free video-on-demand services; home entertainment revenues, which are derived from the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners, as well as from the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (“TVOD”) and electronic sell-through services; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and fees from the distribution of third-party programming. For 2020, content licensing revenues decreased 8%, reflecting a lower volume of licensing primarily as a result of several significant licensing agreements for library programming in the prior-year periods, production shutdowns because of COVID-19, and significant revenues in the 2019 periods from the licensing of the final season of several series, including\nJane the Virgin\nand\nElementary\n. These declines were partially offset by the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to\nSouth Park\nto an SVOD provider in 2020.\nRevenues from the licensing of exhibition rights are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, and therefore, content licensing revenue comparisons are impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of our programming for multiyear licensing agreements.\nTheatrical\nTheatrical revenues are principally earned from the worldwide theatrical distribution of films through audience ticket sales. For 2020, the declines in theatrical revenues reflect the impact from the\nclosure or reduction in capacity of movie theaters in response to COVID-19 throughout\nmost of 2020.\nII-11\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOther\nOther revenues are principally comprised of revenues from the rental of production facilities and digital revenues from search and e-commerce partners. For 2020, other revenues decreased 23%, primarily reflecting lower revenues from the rental of our production facilities as a result of the shutdown of production due to COVID-19.\nOperating Expenses\nn/m - not meaningful\nProduction\nProduction expenses principally reflect the amortization of costs of internally-produced television and theatrical film content as well as other television production costs, including on-air talent. For 2020, the 5% decrease primarily reflects a lower volume of production resulting from the impact of COVID-19, including fewer episodes of our original programming and a lower number of theatrical releases.\nProgramming\nProgramming expenses reflect the amortization of acquired programs exhibited on our television broadcast networks, cable networks and television stations. For 2020, the 12% decrease in programming expenses was driven by lower sports programming costs, including from the comparison against CBS’ broadcasts of NCAA Tournament games in 2019. The decline also reflects the mix of programming on our broadcast network.\nParticipation, Residual and Distribution\nParticipation, residual and distribution costs primarily include participation and residual expenses for television and film programming and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to film and television content, such as print and advertising. For 2020, participation, residual and distribution costs decreased 16% reflecting distribution costs in the prior-year periods to support theatrical releases, including\nGemini Man\n,\nRocketman\n,\nand\nDora and the Lost City of Gold\n. Theatrical distribution costs were significantly lower in the 2020 periods as a result of the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters due to COVID-19. The lower expenses also reflect the decline in content licensing revenues, as well as the mix of titles licensed in each year.\nProgramming Charges\nDuring 2020, we recorded programming charges of $159 million primarily related to the abandonment of certain incomplete programs resulting from production shutdowns related to COVID-19.\nDuring 2019, in connection with the Merger, we implemented management changes across the organization. In connection with these changes, we performed an evaluation of our programming portfolio across all of our\nII-12\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nbusinesses, including an assessment of the optimal use of our programming in the marketplace, which resulted in the identification of programs not aligned with management’s strategy. As a result, we recorded programming charges of $589 million principally reflecting accelerated amortization associated with changes in the expected monetization of certain programs, and decisions to cease airing, alter future airing patterns or not renew certain programs.\nOther\nOther operating expenses primarily include compensation, revenue-sharing costs with our affiliated stations, and other ancillary and overhead costs associated with our operations. For 2020, the 5% increase in other operating expenses was driven by increased revenue-sharing costs as a result of the growth in retransmission and subscription streaming revenues.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy, professional service fees and back office support, including employee compensation. The 3% decrease in SG&A expenses was driven by savings from restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, as well as lower travel and entertainment and other expense decreases associated with shutdowns resulting from COVID-19. The decrease in SG&A expenses also includes lower advertising and promotion costs reflecting the broadcast of fewer original programs, partially offset by increased costs to support the growth and expansion of our streaming services.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense reflects depreciation of fixed assets, including transponders and equipment under finance leases, amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, and impairment of fixed and intangible assets, when applicable. For 2020, amortization expense\nincluded an impairment charge of $25 million in the\nTV Entertainment\nsegment to write down the carrying values of FCC licenses in two markets to their fair values (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements) and accelerated depreciation of $12 million resulting from the abandonment of technology in connection with synergy plans related to the Merger (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). For 2019, amortization expense included an impairment charge of $20 million to reduce the carrying value of broadcast licenses in Australia to their fair value. The comparison for depreciation and amortization also includes a decline as a result of assets that became fully depreciated.\nII-13\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRestructuring and Other Corporate Matters\nDuring 2020 and 2019, we recorded costs for restructuring and other corporate matters as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded restructuring charges of $542 million, associated with cost-transformation initiatives in connection with the Merger in an effort to reduce redundancies across our businesses. These charges primarily consist of severance costs, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation. In addition, in 2020 we incurred costs of $56 million in connection with the Merger, consisting of professional fees mainly associated with integration activities, as well as transaction-related bonuses. We also incurred costs of $5 million for professional fees associated with dispositions and other corporate matters, and we recorded a charge of $15 million to write down property and equipment that has been classified as held for sale to its fair value less costs to sell.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $418 million, primarily for severance costs, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, in connection with the Merger, as well as costs related to a restructuring plan initiated in the first quarter of 2019 under which severance payments were provided to certain eligible employees who voluntarily elected to participate. In addition, in 2019 we incurred costs of $294 million in connection with the Merger, consisting of financial advisory, legal and other professional fees, transaction-related bonuses, and contractual executive compensation, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, that was triggered by the Merger. We also incurred costs of $40 million in connection with the settlement of a commercial dispute and $17 million associated with legal proceedings involving the Company (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements) and other corporate matters.\nIncluded in restructuring charges for both 2020 and 2019 were costs resulting from the termination of contractual obligations and charges associated with the exit of leases.\nGain on Sales\nIn 2020, we completed the sale of CMG to Red Ventures for $484 million, including an estimated working capital adjustment.\nThe purchase price consisted of a cash payment at closing of $459 million and a credit of $25 million to be used over five years for the purchase of advertising and licensing of data from Red Ventures. This transaction resulted in a gain of $214 million.\nIn 2019, we completed the sale of CBS Television City for $750 million. We have guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first five years following the completion of the sale. This transaction resulted in a gain of $549 million for 2019, which included a reduction for the present value of the estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation.\nII-14\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nThe following table presents our outstanding debt balances, excluding finance leases, and the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nn/a - not applicable\nNet Gains from Investments\nFor 2020, net gains from investments of $206 million primarily reflect an increase of $213 million in the fair value of our investment in fuboTV, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2020, and for 2019 net gains from investments of $85 million reflect a gain on marketable securities of $113 million, gains of $22 million on the sale and acquisition of joint ventures, and an impairment charge of $50 million to write down an investment to its fair value.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nFor 2020, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $126 million associated with the early redemption of $2.77 billion of our long-term debt.\nOther Items, Net\nThe following table presents the components of Other items, net.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For 2020, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $535 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 17.0%. Included in the provision for income taxes was a discrete tax benefit of $110 million, primarily consisting of a benefit of $100 million to remeasure our U.K. net deferred income tax asset as a result of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% enacted during the third quarter, as well as a benefit of $13 million realized in connection with the preparation of the 2019 tax returns. These items, together with a net tax benefit of $129 million on the items identified as affecting comparability in\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n, including restructuring and other\nII-15\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ncorporate matters, programming charges, and net gains from investments, reduced our effective income tax rate by 4.1 percentage points.\nFor 2019, we recorded a tax benefit of $29 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of (0.9)%. Included in the benefit for income taxes were discrete items of $827 million, primarily consisting of a tax benefit of $768 million resulting from the transfer of intangible assets between our subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations, a tax benefit of $44 million realized in connection with the preparation of the 2018 federal tax return, based on further clarity provided by the U.S. government on tax positions relating to the  Tax Reform Act, and a tax benefit of $39 million principally related to the bankruptcy of an investee. These items, taken together with a net tax benefit of $102 million on the items identified as affecting comparability in\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures,\nincluding restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges, and gain on sales, reduced the effective income tax rate by 23.6 percentage points.\nIn March 2020, the U.S. government enacted tax legislation containing provisions to support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic (the “CARES Act”), including deferment of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes, refundable payroll tax credits, and technical amendments to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2020. We do not expect the future impact of the CARES Act provisions to be material.\nEquity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax\nThe following table presents equity in loss of investee companies for our equity-method investments.\nFor 2020, equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax includes an impairment charge of $9 million relating to an international television joint venture.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor 2020,\nnet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily reflects our joint venture partners’ share of profit from the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to\nSouth Park\nto an SVOD provider in the second quarter of 2020.\nII-16\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to ViacomCBS and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to ViacomCBS\nFor 2020, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and diluted EPS from continuing operations each decreased 27%, reflecting higher discrete tax benefits in 2019.\nNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our publishing business, Simon & Schuster, to Penguin Random House LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. Simon & Schuster has been presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.\nThe following tables set forth details of net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(a) Primarily relates to indemnification obligations for leases associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. (“Famous Players”).\nII-17\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nConsolidated Results of Operations— 2019 vs. 2018\nRevenues\nAdvertising\nFor 2019, the 2% increase in advertising revenues was driven by 5% growth in domestic advertising revenues, reflecting CBS’ broadcast of tentpole sporting events in 2019, mainly\nSuper Bowl LIII\nand the national semifinals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament, as well as higher revenues from our streaming businesses, including Pluto TV. These increases were partially offset by lower political advertising sales at our owned television stations, as a result of the benefit to 2018 from midterm elections. International advertising revenues decreased 14%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes, as well as softness in the Australian and U.K. markets, partially offset by increases in pricing and political advertising in Argentina. Foreign exchange rate changes had an unfavorable impact of 1-percentage point on the total advertising revenues comparison and 9-percentage points on the international advertising revenues comparison.\nAffiliate\nFor 2019, the 3% increase in affiliate revenues reflects 20% growth in reverse compensation and retransmission fee revenues, driven by annual contractual increases and contract renewals with MVPDs and vMVPDs, as well as 45% growth from our streaming services, including CBS All Access\nand Showtime OTT, driven by subscriber growth. These increases were partially offset by 5% lower cable affiliate fees, mainly resulting from subscriber declines. Domestic affiliate revenues increased 4%, while international affiliate revenues decreased 6% from 2018 driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Foreign exchange rate changes had an unfavorable impact of 1-percentage point on the total affiliate revenues comparison and 6-percentage points on the international affiliate revenues comparison.\nContent Licensing\nFor 2019, content licensing revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting higher revenues from the domestic licensing of our content, driven by the production of programming for third parties and the licensing of programming to SVOD providers. These increases were partially offset by a decline in international licensing revenues.\nTheatrical\nFor 2019, theatrical revenues decreased 26%, principally reflecting a difficult comparison to 2018, which included the releases of\nMission: Impossible - Fallout\nand\nA Quiet Plac\ne. Theatrical revenues in 2019 benefited from the releases of\nRocketman\n,\nGemini Man\nand\nDora and the Lost City of Gold\n, as well as the continued success of the 2018 release,\nBumblebee\n. Domestic theatrical revenues decreased 31% and international theatrical revenues decreased 23%.\nII-18\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOther\nFor 2019, other revenues decreased 3%, mainly reflecting lower revenues from the rental of our production facilities as a result of the sale of CBS Television City in January 2019.\nOperating Expenses\nn/m - not meaningful\nProduction\nFor 2019, the 5% increase in production expenses reflected an increased investment in content, including a higher number of series produced for distribution on multiple platforms, including our streaming services and cable networks, as well as higher amortization of television production costs associated with the increase in content licensing revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower amortization of feature film costs, driven by costs in 2018 associated with\nMission: Impossible - Fallout\n.\nProgramming\nFor 2019, the 8% increase in programming expenses was driven by higher sports programming costs, mainly from CBS’ broadcasts of\nSuper Bowl LIII\nand the national semifinals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament in 2019, which were not broadcast by CBS in 2018, and programming for Pluto TV, which we acquired in March 2019. These increases were partially offset by lower amortization of acquired programming for our cable networks.\nParticipation, Residual and Distribution\nFor 2019, the 3% increase in participation, residual and distribution costs was driven by higher participation costs associated with the increase in content licensing revenues.\nProgramming Charges\nDuring 2019, in connection with the Merger, we implemented management changes across the organization. In connection with these changes, we performed an evaluation of our programming portfolio across all of our businesses, including an assessment of the optimal use of our programming in the marketplace, which resulted in the identification of programs not aligned with management’s strategy. As a result, we recorded programming charges of $589 million principally reflecting accelerated amortization associated with changes in the expected monetization of certain programs, and decisions to cease airing, alter future airing patterns or not renew certain programs.\nII-19\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nIn addition, during 2018, in connection with management changes, we recorded programming charges of $162 million relating to changes to our programming strategy, including at CBS Films, which shifted its focus from theatrical films to developing content for our streaming services, as well as at our\nCable Networks\nsegment where we ceased the use of certain programming.\nOther\nFor 2019, the 9% increase in other operating expenses mainly reflected higher costs associated with growth and expansion of our streaming services.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor 2019, the 9% increase in SG&A expenses was driven by higher advertising and marketing costs, reflecting an increase in the number of series premieres and costs associated with our streaming services, as well as the inclusion of Pluto TV and Pop TV since their acquisitions in the first quarter of 2019. These increases were partially offset by cost savings associated with restructuring activities and compensation cost savings resulting from changes in senior management at CBS in 2018.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor 2019, depreciation and amortization expense includes an impairment charge of $20 million to reduce the carrying value of broadcast licenses in Australia to their fair value.\nRestructuring and Other Corporate Matters\nDuring 2019 and 2018, we recorded costs for restructuring and other corporate matters as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $418 million, primarily for severance costs, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, in connection with the Merger, as well as costs related to a restructuring plan initiated in the first quarter of 2019 under which severance payments were provided to certain eligible employees who voluntarily elected to participate. In addition, in 2019 we incurred costs of $294 million in connection with the Merger, consisting of financial advisory, legal and other professional fees, transaction-related bonuses, and contractual executive compensation, including the accelerated\nII-20\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nvesting of stock-based compensation, that was triggered by the Merger. We also incurred costs of $40 million in connection with the settlement of a commercial dispute and $17 million associated with legal proceedings involving the Company (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements) and other corporate matters.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $309 million resulting from cost transformation initiatives to improve margins, as well as restructuring-related costs of $52 million, comprised of third-party professional services associated with such initiatives. In addition, in 2018 we recorded expenses of $128 million primarily for professional fees related to legal proceedings, investigations at our Company and the evaluation of potential merger activity.\nIncluded in restructuring charges for both 2019 and 2018 were costs resulting from the termination of contractual obligations and charges associated with the exit of leases.\nGain on Sales\nIn 2019, we completed the sale of CBS Television City for $750 million, which resulted in a gain of $549 million. We also recognized a tax benefit of $140 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the reversal of a valuation allowance relating to capital loss carryforwards that were utilized in connection with this sale.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nThe following table presents our outstanding debt balances, excluding finance leases, and the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investments\nFor 2019, net gains from investment of $85 million included a gain on marketable securities of $113 million, gains of $22 million on the sale and acquisition of joint ventures, and an impairment charge of $50 million to write down an investment to its fair value. For 2018, the net loss on investments of $53 million included a loss on marketable securities of $23 million, an impairment charge of $46 million to write an investment down to its fair value, and a gain of $16 million on the sale of a 1% equity interest in Viacom18 to our joint venture partner.\nGain on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nFor 2018, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $18 million associated with the redemption of senior notes and debentures prior to maturity totaling $1.13 billion.\nII-21\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOther Items, Net\nThe following table presents the components of Other items, net.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\nFor 2019, we recorded a tax benefit of $29 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of (0.9)%.

These items, taken together with a net tax benefit of $102 million on the items identified as affecting comparability in\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures,\nincluding restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges, and gain on sales, reduced the effective income tax rate by 23.6 percentage points.\nFor 2018, the provision for income taxes was $580 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 14.6%. The provision for income taxes included discrete items of $297 million, primarily consisting of the reversal of a valuation allowance of $140 million relating to capital loss carryforwards that were utilized in connection with the sale of CBS Television City in 2019; a tax benefit of $80 million relating to the Tax Reform Act and other tax law changes; and a tax benefit of $71 million relating to a tax accounting method change granted by the IRS.\nEquity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax\nThe following table presents equity in loss of investee companies for our equity-method investments.\nII-22\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to ViacomCBS and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to ViacomCBS\nFor 2019, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 5% and 4%, respectively, primarily driven by the lower operating income, mainly reflecting our increased investment in content. The lower operating income was partially offset by the aforementioned discrete tax benefits.\nNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nThe following tables set forth details of net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n(a) Primarily relates to indemnification obligations for leases associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players.\nII-23\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nSegments\nWe operate in the following three segments:\nTV ENTERTAINMENT:\nTV Entertainment\nconsists of the CBS Television Network, our domestic broadcast network; CBS Studios and CBS Media Ventures, our television production and syndication operations; our CBS-branded streaming services, including CBS All Access (to be rebranded as Paramount+ in March 2021) and CBSN, among others; CBS Sports Network, our cable network focused on college athletics and other sports; and CBS Television Stations, our owned broadcast television stations.\nTV Entertainment’s\nrevenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, the licensing and distribution of content, and affiliate revenues, comprised of reverse compensation, retransmission fees, and subscription fees for our streaming services.\nCABLE NETWORKS:\nCable Networks\noperates a portfolio of premium subscription cable networks, including Showtime; basic cable networks including BET, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, and Smithsonian Channel, among others; streaming services including Pluto TV, Showtime OTT, Noggin, and BET+; international extensions of these brands; and our international free-to-air broadcast networks, including Network 10, Channel 5 and Telefe.\nCable Networks’\nrevenues are generated primarily from affiliate revenues, comprised of fees from MVPDs and vMVPDs for carriage of our cable networks, and subscription fees from our streaming services; advertising sales; and the licensing of our content and brands.\nFILMED ENTERTAINMENT: Our\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment operates Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation, and Paramount Television Studios, and also includes Miramax, a consolidated joint venture.\nFilmed Entertainment’s\nrevenues are generated primarily from the release and/or distribution of films theatrically, the release and/or distribution of film and television product through home entertainment, the licensing of film and television product to television and digital platforms and other ancillary activities.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell Simon & Schuster, which was previously reported as the\nPublishing\nsegment. Simon & Schuster has been presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.\nWe present operating income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and gain on sales, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. We believe the presentation of Adjusted OIBDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by our management and enhances their ability to understand our operating performance. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management. Stock-based compensation is included as a component of our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA. The reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to our consolidated net earnings is presented in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\nII-24\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nSegment Results of Operations - 2020 vs. 2019\nn/m - not meaningful\nII-25\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nTV Entertainment\nRevenues\nFor 2020, the\n10% decrease in revenues was mainly driven by the comparison against CBS’ broadcasts of tentpole sporting events in 2019, the impact of COVID-19 on our business during 2020, including weakness in the advertising market and the delay to the start of the television broadcast season, and lower content licensing revenues, partially offset by growth in affiliate revenues.\nAdvertising\nThe 16%\ndecrease in advertising revenues was primarily driven by the aforementioned impact of COVID-19, as well as the comparison against CBS’ broadcasts of\nSuper Bowl LIII\nand the NCAA Tournament in 2019. Under the current contract with the NFL, the Super Bowl is broadcast on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks through the 2022 season, with CBS broadcasting these games in 2019 and 2021. The 2020 NCAA Tournament, which was scheduled to be broadcast by CBS in the first quarter of 2020, was cancelled as a result of COVID-19. In addition, the national semifinals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which are broadcast by CBS every other year through 2032 under agreements with the NCAA and Turner, were broadcast on CBS in the second quarter of 2019. Advertising revenues in 2020 benefited from record political advertising associated with the U.S. presidential election in 2020.\nAffiliate\nAffiliate revenues grew 23%, reflecting 19% growth in reverse compensation and retransmission fee revenues, as well as subscriber growth at CBS All Access.\nContent Licensing\nContent licensing revenues decreased 25%, mainly due to a lower volume of licensing of our programming during 2020, as 2019 included several significant licensing agreements for library programming and the licensing of the final season of several series, including\nJane the Virgin\nand\nElementary\n, and 2020 was impacted by production delays related to COVID-19.\nOther\nOther revenues decreased 20%, primarily reflecting lower revenues from the rental of our production facilities as a result of production shutdowns due to COVID-19.\nRevenues in 2021 will benefit from the CBS Television Network’s broadcasts of\nSuper Bowl LV\nand the national semifinals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament. Comparability in 2021 will be negatively\nII-26\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nimpacted, however, by lower political advertising revenues driven by the comparison against the U.S. presidential election in 2020.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA decreased 24% driven by the decline in revenues and increased costs to support the growth and expansion of CBS All Access. These decreases were partially offset by lower production and programming costs as a result of the comparison against the broadcast of major sporting events in 2019, production shutdowns in 2020 due to COVID-19, and the mix of programming. Participation expense was also lower as a result of the decline in content licensing revenues.\nCable Networks\nRevenues\nFor 2020, revenues increased 1%, due to higher content licensing revenues, mainly reflecting the licensing of the domestic streaming rights for\nSouth Park\nto an SVOD provider, partially offset by a decline in advertising revenues. Domestic revenues increased 4% while international revenues decreased 10%, including a 2-percentage point unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenues decreased 8% primarily driven by the adverse effects of COVID-19. Domestic advertising revenues decreased 6%, reflecting lower linear impressions, including from weakness in the advertising market as a result of COVID-19. This decrease was partially offset by growth from our streaming businesses, including revenues from Pluto TV\n,\nwhich was acquired in March 2019, and higher pricing. International advertising revenues decreased 12%, primarily reflecting weakness in the advertising market. Foreign exchange rate changes had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on both worldwide and international advertising revenues.\nAffiliate\nDomestic affiliate revenues remained flat, as the declines in subscribers at our cable networks were offset by growth from our subscription streaming services, including Showtime OTT, BET+, and Noggin, and the launch of our basic cable networks on a vMVPD service. International affiliate revenues decreased 3%, including a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes.\nContent Licensing\nThe 43% increase in content licensing revenues was primarily the result of growth from the domestic licensing of programming to SVOD providers, mainly from\nSouth Park,\nand higher download-to-own revenues, led by sales of\nYellowstone.\nII-27\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA increased 7%, driven by the revenue growth and lower SG&A expenses, reflecting lower advertising and promotion costs due to the broadcast of fewer original programs, savings from restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, as well as lower travel and entertainment expenses associated with shutdowns resulting from COVID-19. These cost decreases were partially offset by higher participation costs associated with the mix of titles licensed each year.\nFilmed Entertainment\nRevenues\nFor 2020, the 14% decrease in revenues reflects the impact from the closure or reduction in capacity of movie theaters in response to COVID-19 throughout most of 2020.\nTheatrical\nThe 67% decrease in theatrical revenues reflects the impact from the closure or reduction in capacity of movie theaters t\nhroughout most of\n2020. Theatrical revenues during the current year benefited from the theatrical release of\nSonic the Hedgehog\nin the first quarter, while the prior year benefited from several significant theatrical releases\n.\nHome Entertainment\nThe 14% increase in home entertainment revenues was driven by higher sales of catalog titles and titles from Miramax, which was acquired in 2020. The current year benefited from the 2020 releases of\nSonic the Hedgehog\nand\nTerminator: Dark Fate,\nas well as\nGemini Man\n, which was released in the home entertainment market in late 2019\n,\nwhile the prior-year benefited from\nBumblebee, Rocketman, Mission: Impossible - Fallout\nand\nInstant Family\n.\nLicensing\nThe 6% decrease in licensing revenues was primarily due to lower revenues from the licensing of catalog titles, television programming produced for third parties\nand music rights. These decreases were partially offset by the licensing of Miramax titles in 2020 and current year releases, including\nLovebirds\nand the international licensing of\nThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA increased $135 million as the revenue decline was more than offset by lower distribution and film production costs resulting from fewer theatrical releases in the current year due to COVID-19.

The Super Bowl is broadcast on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks through the 2022 season under the current contract with the NFL and the national semifinals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament are broadcast on the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreement with the NCAA and Turner.\nAffiliate\nAffiliate revenues grew 22% primarily as a result of a 20% increase in reverse compensation and retransmission fee revenues as well as subscriber growth at CBS All Access.\nContent Licensing\nContent licensing increased 5%, driven by higher revenues from the production of programming for third parties, including\nUnbelievable\nand\nDead to Me,\nand higher revenues from the licensing of library programming to SVOD providers.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA decreased 1% as a result of an increased investment in content and higher costs associated with the growth and expansion of our streaming services, partially offset by higher revenues.\nII-30\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCable Networks\nRevenues\nFor 2019, revenues decreased 2% from 2018, reflecting an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate changes of 2-percentage points. Domestic revenues remained substantially flat compared with 2018 as higher advertising revenues were offset by a decline in affiliate revenues. International revenues decreased 9% mainly as a result of a 7-percentage point unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenues remained flat compared with 2018 and included an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes of 3-percentage points. Domestic advertising revenues increased 6%, reflecting higher revenues from our streaming businesses,\nincluding Pluto TV\n,\nwhich was acquired in March 2019. The domestic advertising growth also reflects higher pricing and the inclusion of the results of Pop TV\n.\nWe began consolidating Pop TV\nin March 2019 when we acquired the 50% stake we did not own, which brought our ownership to 100%. These increases were partially offset by lower linear impressions. International advertising revenues decreased 13%, mainly reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes of 9-percentage points, as well as softness in the Australian and U.K. markets, partially offset by increases in pricing and political advertising in Argentina.\nAffiliate\nAffiliate revenues decreased 4%, which included a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate changes. Domestic affiliate revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven by declines in traditional MVPD subscribers at our cable networks. These declines were partially offset by growth from Showtime OTT, the inclusion of the results of Pop TV\n,\nand contractual rate increases under carriage agreements. International affiliate revenues decreased 6%, reflecting a 6-percentage point unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes.\nContent Licensing\nThe 1% increase in content licensing revenues, which includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes of 1-percentage point, was the result of increased revenues from the production of programming for third parties, including\nThe Real World\nand\nBellator\nmixed martial arts events. These increases were partially offset by lower secondary market revenue, driven by the renewal of a significant domestic licensing agreement for the Showtime original series,\nDexter,\nin 2018.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA decreased 19%, driven by lower revenues as well as increased investment in content and higher advertising and promotion expenses.\nII-31\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFilmed Entertainment\nn/m - not meaningful\nRevenues\nFor 2019, the 1% increase in revenues reflects growth in licensing revenues, partially offset by lower theatrical revenues. Foreign exchange rate changes had a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact on the revenue comparison.\nTheatrical\nThe 26% decrease in theatrical revenues principally reflects a difficult comparison to 2018, which included the releases of\nMission: Impossible - Fallout\nand\nA Quiet Place\n. Theatrical revenues in 2019 benefited from the releases of\nRocketman, Gemini Man\nand\nDora and the Lost City of Gold\n, as well as the continued success of the 2018 release,\nBumblebee\n. Foreign exchange rate changes had a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact on theatrical revenues.\nHome Entertainment\nThe 1% increase in home entertainment revenues was driven by the number and mix of titles in release. Significant 2019 releases included\nBumblebee, Rocketman\n,\nInstant Family\n, and\nPet Sematary\n, while 2018 benefited from the releases of\nMission: Impossible - Fallout\n,\nDaddy’s Home 2\nand\nA Quiet Place\n.\nChanges in foreign exchange rates resulted in a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact on the revenue comparison.\nLicensing\nThe 14% growth in licensing revenues was driven by increases in licensing of film catalog titles to SVOD providers and recent releases to pay television services. Foreign exchange rate changes had a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact on licensing revenues.\nOther\nThe 9% increase in other revenues was driven by higher studio rental revenues.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA for 2019 increased to $80 million from a loss of $33 million for 2018, principally driven by higher profits from licensing of film library titles. This increase was partially offset by costs associated with future film releases and higher incentive compensation costs. Fluctuations in results for the\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment may occur as a result of the timing of the recognition of print and advertising expenses, which are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film, while the revenues for the respective film are recognized as earned through the film’s theatrical exhibition and subsequent distribution windows.\nII-32\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Our operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, leases, interest payments, income tax payments and pension funding obligations. Our investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under our $3.50 billion Credit Facility, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.\nOur funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to us, the Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. We routinely assess our capital structure and opportunistically enter into transactions to lower our interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.\nFunding for our long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of $5.11 billion is expected to come from our ability to refinance our debt, cash generated from operating activities, and proceeds from non-core asset sales.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued $4.50 billion of senior notes with interest rates ranging from 4.20% to 4.95% and due dates from 2025 to 2050. The net proceeds from these issuances are being used for the redemption of our long-term debt as well as for general corporate purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we redeemed, prior to maturity, senior notes, debentures, and junior subordinated debentures totaling $2.77 billion, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.88 billion.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced that we entered into an agreement to sell Simon & Schuster for $2.175 billion in cash, which is expected to close in 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. In addition, we completed the sale of CMG for cash proceeds of $459 million and advertising and data licensing credits of $25 million. These divestitures are a result of a strategic review of our non-core assets. Proceeds from these transactions will be used to invest in our strategic growth priorities, including in streaming, as well as to fund the dividend and pay down debt.\nThe ongoing impact of COVID-19 could have a negative effect on our financial condition or our ability to fund operations, dividends or future investment opportunities due to an increase in the cost of, or difficulty in, obtaining debt or equity financing, or our ability to comply with the leverage covenant in our Credit Facility in the future. The magnitude of the continuing impact on our financial condition and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or control, including the duration and extent of the pandemic, the impact of federal, state, local and foreign governmental actions, consumer behavior in response to the pandemic and such governmental actions, and the economic and operating conditions that we may face in the aftermath of COVID-19.\nII-33\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOur access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facility and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding for our expected cash needs. The cost of any new borrowings are affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $2.36 billion of remaining availability under our share repurchase program. Any share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt.\nCash Flows\nThe changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were as follows:\nOperating Activities.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by significantly lower spending, including for programming, production, advertising and distribution costs resulting from production shutdowns related to COVID-19 and cost savings, as well as lower payments for income taxes. These impacts were partially offset by the decline in revenues and higher payments for restructuring, merger-related costs, and costs to achieve synergies.\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily driven by increased spending for television and film programming, higher payments for income taxes and payments of $132 million associated with costs related to the Merger.\nCash paid for income taxes from continuing operations decreased to $411 million for 2020 from $560 million for 2019. The comparison was impacted by a payment in 2019 as a result of guidance issued by the U.S. government in January 2019 relating to the transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits that resulted from the enactment of federal tax legislation in December 2017. The increase in cash payments for income taxes from continuing operations for 2019 compared to $153 million for 2018 was primarily due to the aforementioned payment in 2019, as well as a benefit to 2018 from the application of a federal income tax overpayment carryforward from 2017.\nII-34\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations reflects the operating activities of Simon & Schuster.\nInvesting Activities\n(a) Primarily includes our investment in The CW.\n(b) 2020 primarily reflects the acquisition of Miramax, a global film and television studio. 2019 primarily reflects the acquisition of Pluto Inc. and the remaining 50% interest in Pop TV, a general entertainment cable network. 2018 primarily reflects the acquisitions of WhoSay Inc., a leading influence marketing firm, Pop Culture Media, a digital entertainment media company, and VidCon LLC, a host of conferences dedicated to online video.\n(c) 2020 reflects the sale of CMG and marketable securities. 2019 primarily reflects the sale of CBS Television City.\nFinancing Activities\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects our net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures. Our calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to our operations. Our net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nManagement believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to us to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain our capital assets, satisfy our tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of our ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of our operating performance. We believe the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying\nII-35\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\noperations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is among several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by our investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of our operating performance to other companies in our industry.\nAs free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations as a measure of liquidity or net earnings as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations to free cash flow.\nDividends\nWe declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the quarters of 2020, resulting in total dividends for the year of $601 million, or $.96 per share. On December 19, 2019, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.24 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, resulting in total dividends of $150 million. Prior to the Merger, Viacom and CBS each declared a quarterly cash dividend during each of the first three quarters of 2019 and during each of the four quarters of 2018. During the first three quarters of 2019, CBS declared total per share dividends of $.54, resulting in total dividends of $205 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, CBS declared total per share dividends of $.72, resulting in total annual dividends of $274 million. During the first three quarters of 2019, Viacom declared total per share dividends of $.60, resulting in total dividends of $245 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Viacom declared total per share dividends of $.80, resulting in total annual dividends of $325 million.\nOn February 9, 2021, ViacomCBS declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.24 per share on its Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2021.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2020, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock under our share repurchase program for $50 million, at an average cost of $38.63 per share. At December 31, 2020, $2.36 billion of authorization remained under the share repurchase program.\nII-36\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCapital Structure\nThe following table sets forth our debt.\n(a)    At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the senior and junior subordinated debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of $491 million and $412 million, respectively, and (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of $107 million and $92 million, respectively. The face value of our total debt was $20.33 billion at December 31, 2020 and $19.23 billion at December 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued $4.50 billion of senior notes with interest rates ranging from 4.20% to 4.95% and due dates from 2025 to 2050. The net proceeds from these issuances are being used for the redemption of our long-term debt as well as for general corporate purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2020\n,\nwe redeemed, prior to maturity, senior notes, debentures, and junior subordinated debentures totaling $2.77 billion, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.88 billion. These redemptions resulted in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $126 million ($97 million, net of tax).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued $500 million of 4.20% senior notes due 2029. We used the net proceeds from this issuance in the redemption of our $600 million outstanding 2.30% senior notes due August 2019. During 2019, we also repaid the $220 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.625% senior notes due September 2019 and the $90 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.75% senior notes due December 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we redeemed $1.13 billion of senior notes and debentures for a redemption price of $1.10 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain on extinguishment of debt of $18 million ($14 million, net of tax).\nOur 5.875% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 and 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rates until February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2027, respectively, on which dates the rates will switch to floating rates based on three-month LIBOR plus 3.895% and 3.899%, respectively, reset quarterly. These debentures can be called by us at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period.\nThe subordination, interest deferral option and extended term of the junior subordinated debentures provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50% equity credit by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings Inc., and a 25% equity credit by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.\nThe interest rate payable on our 2.25% senior notes due February 2022 and 3.45% senior notes due October 2026, collectively the “Senior Notes”, will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the\nII-37\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nSenior Notes. The interest rate on these Senior Notes would increase by 0.25% upon each credit agency downgrade up to a maximum of 2.00%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. At December 31, 2020, the outstanding principal amount of our 2.25% senior notes due February 2022 and 3.45% senior notes due October 2026 was $35 million and $124 million, respectively.\nSome of our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures.\nCommercial Paper\nIn January 2020, our commercial paper program was increased to $3.50 billion from $2.50 billion in conjunction with the new $3.50 billion revolving credit facility described below. At December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2019, we had $699 million outstanding commercial paper borrowings under our commercial paper program at a weighted average interest rate of 2.07% and maturities of less than 90 days.\nCredit Facility\nIn January 2020, the $2.50 billion revolving credit facility held by CBS prior to the Merger, with a maturity in June 2021, was terminated and the revolving credit facility held by Viacom prior to the Merger, with a maturity in February 2024, was amended and restated to a $3.50 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity in January 2025 (the “Credit Facility”). The credit facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper outstanding, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at our option at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or LIBOR plus a margin based on our senior unsecured debt rating, depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered. The Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to be less than 4.5x (which we may elect to increase to 5.0x for up to four consecutive quarters following a qualified acquisition) at the end of each quarter. The Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. We met the covenant as of December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $3.50 billion.\nOther Bank Borrowings\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $95 million of bank borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 3.50% under Miramax’s $300 million credit facility, which matures in April 2023.\nII-38\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, payments due by period under our significant contractual obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows:\n(a) Our programming and talent commitments include $5.98 billion for sports programming rights and $3.87 billion relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, including talent contracts.\n(b) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.\n(c) Consists of operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities. Amounts reflect future minimum payments, excluding interest.\n(d) Reflects long-term debt obligations at face value, excluding finance leases.\n(e) Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities. Interest payments on junior subordinated debentures subsequent to the expiration of their fixed-rate periods have been included based on their current fixed rates.\n(f)  Includes finance lease obligations for satellite transponders and equipment, excluding interest.\n(g) Reflects long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, including program liabilities; participations; residuals; and a tax liability resulting from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. This tax liability reflects the remaining tax on our historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS in 2024 and 2025.\nThe table above does not include payments relating to reserves for uncertain tax positions of $308 million and related interest and penalties, redeemable noncontrolling interest of $197 million, our guarantee liability of $100 million relating to the sale of CBS Television City, lease indemnification obligations of $67 million, residual liabilities of previously disposed businesses, and potential future contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The amount and timing of payments with respect to these items are subject to a number of uncertainties such that we are unable to make sufficiently reliable estimations of future payments.\nIn 2021, we expect to make contributions of approximately $15 million to our qualified pension plans for minimum funding requirements under ERISA and $86 million to our non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2021, we expect to contribute approximately $39 million to our other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy our portion of benefit payments due under these plans.\nGuarantees\nLetters of Credit and Surety Bonds.\nWe have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At\nII-39\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2020, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $144 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCBS Television City\n.  In connection with the sale of CBS Television City in 2019, we guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first five years following the completion of the sale. Included in “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020 is a liability of $100 million, reflecting the present value of the remaining estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation.\nLease Guarantees.\nWe have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players. These lease commitments amounted to $67 million as of December 31, 2020, and are presented within “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of lease commitments varies over time depending on expiration or termination of individual underlying leases, or the related indemnification obligation, and foreign exchange rates, among other things. We may also have exposure for certain other expenses related to the leases, such as property taxes and common area maintenance. We believe our accrual is sufficient to meet any future obligations based on our consideration of available financial information, the lessees’ historical performance in meeting their lease obligations and the underlying economic factors impacting the lessees’ business models.\nFilm Financing Arrangements.\nFrom time to time we enter into film or television programming (collectively referred to as “film”) financing arrangements that involve the sale of a partial copyright interest in a film to third-party investors. Since the investors typically have the risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film, we generally record the amounts received for the sale of copyright interest as a reduction of the cost of the film and related cash flows are reflected in net cash flow from operating activities. We also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute films (“co-financing arrangements”), under which each partner is responsible for distribution of the film in specific territories or distribution windows. The partners’ share in the profits and losses of the films under these arrangements are included within participations expense.\nIn the course of our business, we both provide and receive indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. We record a liability for our indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided\nII-40\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nbelow. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Significant judgments used in the determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition include the identification of distinct performance obligations in contracts containing bundled advertising sales and content licenses, and the allocation of consideration among individual performance obligations within these arrangements based on their relative standalone selling prices.\nAdvertising Revenues\n—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or displayed on digital platforms. If a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. To the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. For contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.\nAffiliate Revenues\n—The performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with MVPDs and subscribers to our streaming services, also includes a license to programming for video on demand viewing. Affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to\nour customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. These agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”) for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of our programming.\nContent Licensing Revenues\n—For licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film, which is based on licenses for comparable content within the marketplace. Estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues.\nFilm and Television Production and Programming Costs\nCosts incurred to produce television programs and feature films are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the projected life of each television program or feature film. The costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing. The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports\nII-41\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nprogramming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. Acquired programming rights, including rights for sports programming, are expensed over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived.\nFor internally-produced television programs and feature films that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, we use an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for participations and residuals over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. Management’s judgment is required in estimating Ultimate Revenues and the costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or feature film. These estimates are used to determine the timing of amortization of capitalized production costs and expensing of participation and residual costs.\nFor television programming, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues to be earned within 10 years from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. These estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs.\nFor feature films, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial theatrical release. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. For films intended for theatrical release, we believe the performance during the theatrical exhibition is the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance. Upon a film’s initial release, we update our estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. We also review and revise estimates of Ultimate Revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. After their theatrical release the most sensitive factor affecting our estimates for feature films is the extent of home entertainment sales. In addition to theatrical performance, home entertainment sales vary based on a variety of factors including demand for our titles, the volume and quality of competing products, marketing and promotional strategies, as well as economic conditions.\nFor acquired film libraries, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition.\nFor programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a film group, which includes our acquired programming rights and certain internally-produced television programs, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of the timing of our usage of and benefit from such programming. Such estimates require management’s judgement and include consideration of factors such as expected revenues to be derived from the programming, the expected number of future airings, and, for acquired programming, the length of the license period. If initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues, an accelerated method of amortization is used. These estimates are periodically reviewed and updated based on information available throughout the contractual term or life of each program.\nWe test a film group or individual television program or feature film for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its fair value may be less than its unamortized cost. If the result of the impairment test\nII-42\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nindicates that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded for the amount of the difference. In addition, unamortized costs for internally-produced or acquired programming that have been substantively abandoned are written off.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Test\nWe perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television FCC licenses, on an annual basis and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.\nFCC Licenses\n—FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2020, we had 14 television markets with FCC license book values.\nFor our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for each television market that we estimate has an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. Additionally, we consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2020 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for 10 of our markets. For each market, we weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for revenue and operating costs, as well as average market share. We also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test on these markets was unnecessary.\nA quantitative impairment test of FCC licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, based on an assessment of the relevant factors that could impact the fair value of FCC licenses, including the effects of COVID-19, we determined that an interim impairment test was necessary for three markets in which we hold FCC licenses. The impairment test indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in two markets were lower than their respective carrying values, which resulted from recent declines in industry projections in the markets where these FCC licenses are held, that were further accelerated by COVID-19. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $25 million to write down the carrying values of these FCC licenses to their aggregate estimated fair value of $216 million. This charge is included within “Depreciation and amortization” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations recorded within the\nTV Entertainment\nsegment. Additionally, the estimated fair value of the FCC license in the third market exceeded its carrying value of $53 million by 7%.\nII-43\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFor the 2020 annual test, we performed a quantitative impairment test for the three markets tested during the second quarter, as well as a fourth U.S. television market. The impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in the three markets we tested during the second quarter, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $269 million at December 31, 2020, were within 10% of their respective carrying values. The fourth market had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by more than 20%.\nThe estimated fair values of FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which we own and operate television stations. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, or a further decline in the local television advertising marketplace could result in a downward revision to our current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in an advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of television advertising revenues in that market; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a noncash charge would be required.  Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nGoodwill\n—Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. At December 31, 2020, we had four reporting units. For the 2020 annual impairment test, we tested two reporting units for impairment as of August 31 and the remaining reporting units as of October 31.\nFor our annual impairment test, we perform a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit that management estimates has a fair value that significantly exceeds its respective carrying value. For the 2020 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all of our reporting units. For each reporting unit, we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included actual and expected financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, we considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. We also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units, and that the lower tax rate from tax law changes enacted since the most recent quantitative tests would positively impact the fair value of the reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount and therefore performing quantitative impairment tests was unnecessary.\nA quantitative goodwill impairment test, when performed, includes estimating the fair value of a reporting unit using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow analysis and/or a market-based approach. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates.\nCertain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms, changes in consumer behavior and/or a decrease in audience acceptance of our content could result in changes to our assumptions and judgments used in the goodwill impairment tests. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would\nII-44\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nbe required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLegal Matters\nEstimates of liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We continually evaluate these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While we believe that our accrual for matters related to our predecessor operations, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our liabilities. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.\nPensions\nPension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet our pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the accumulated benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2020, the unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased slightly from the prior year-end due primarily to the favorable performance of pension plan assets and the inclusion of a curtailment gain associated with the elimination of benefit accruals for future service as a result of a plan amendment for our remaining active pension plans. These items were mostly offset by a decrease in the discount rate. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would result in an estimated change to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $135 million and would not have a material impact on 2021 pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $8 million to 2021 pension expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions.  When recording an interim worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nA number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a\nII-45\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nfuture tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors, including, changes in tax laws and interpretations, information received from tax authorities, and other changes in facts and circumstances. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that the reserve for uncertain tax positions of $308 million at December 31, 2020 is properly recorded.\nLegal Matters\nGeneral\nOn an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\nBeginning on February 20, 2020, three purported CBS stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. On March 31, 2020, the Court consolidated the three lawsuits and appointed Bucks County Employees’ Retirement Fund and International Union of Operating Engineers of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action. On April 14, 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a Verified Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against Shari E. Redstone, NAI, Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust, members of the CBS Board of Directors (comprised of Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Brian Goldner, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and nominal defendant ViacomCBS Inc. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to CBS stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 13, 2019, as amended on October 16, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”). The Complaint also alleges waste and unjust enrichment in connection with Mr. Ianniello’s compensation. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. On June 5, 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. On January 27, 2021, the Court dismissed one disclosure claim, while allowing all other claims against the defendants to proceed. Discovery on the surviving claims will now proceed. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.\nBeginning on November 25, 2019, four purported Viacom stockholders filed separate putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. On January 23, 2020, the Court consolidated the four lawsuits. On February 6, 2020, the Court appointed California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. On February 28, 2020, CalPERS, together with Park Employees’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and Louis M. Wilen, filed a First Amended Verified Class Action Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against NAI, NAI\nII-46\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nEntertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the Viacom special transaction committee of the Viacom Board of Directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. On May 22, 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. On December 29, 2020, the Court dismissed the claims against Mr. Bakish, while allowing the claims against the remaining defendants to proceed. Discovery on the surviving claims will now proceed. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestigation-Related Matters\nAs announced on August 1, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in press reports about CBS’ former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at CBS. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors announced the completion of its investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the CBS Board of Directors’ determination, discussed below, with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’ employment. We have received subpoenas from the New York County District Attorney’s Office and the New York City Commission on Human Rights regarding the subject matter of this investigation and related matters. The New York State Attorney General’s Office and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission have also requested information about these matters, including with respect to CBS’ related public disclosures. We may continue to receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future. We are cooperating with these inquiries.\nOn August 27, 2018 and on October 1, 2018, Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. On November 6, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On November 30, 2018, the Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. On February 11, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against CBS, certain current and former senior executives and members of the CBS Board of Directors. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of CBS Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On April 12, 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss this action, which the Court granted in part and denied in part on January 15, 2020. With the exception of one statement made by Mr. Moonves at an industry event in November 2017, in which he allegedly was acting as the agent of CBS, all claims as to all other allegedly false and misleading statements were dismissed. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.\nSeparation Agreement\nOn September 9, 2018, CBS entered into a separation and settlement agreement and releases (the “Separation Agreement”) with Mr. Moonves, pursuant to which Mr. Moonves resigned as a director and as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of CBS. In October 2018, we contributed $120 million to a grantor\nII-47\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ntrust pursuant to the Separation Agreement. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors announced that, following its consideration of the findings of the investigation referred to above, it had determined that there were grounds to terminate Mr. Moonves’ employment for cause under his employment agreement with CBS. Any dispute related to the CBS Board of Directors’ determination is subject to binding arbitration as set forth in the Separation Agreement. On January 16, 2019, Mr. Moonves commenced a binding arbitration proceeding with respect to this matter and the related CBS Board of Directors investigation, which proceeding is ongoing. The assets of the grantor trust will remain in the trust until a final determination in the arbitration. We are currently unable to determine the outcome of the arbitration and the amount, if any, that may be awarded thereunder. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.\nLitigation Related to Television Station Owners\nOn September 9, 2019, the Company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning on or about January 1, 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly competitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The action, which names the Company among fourteen total defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. On October 8, 2019, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the matter, which was denied by the court on November 6, 2020. We believe that the claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.\nClaims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos\nWe are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.\nClaims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2020, we had pending approximately 30,710 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 30,950 as of December 31, 2019 and 31,570 as of December 31, 2018. During 2020, we received approximately 2,910 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 3,150 claims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2020 and 2019 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $35 million and $58 million, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.\nII-48\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFilings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe that our accrual and insurance are sufficient to cover our asbestos liabilities. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.\nOther\nFrom time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and use derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe conduct business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. Additionally, we designate forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions, including future production costs and programming obligations, as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $1.27 billion and $1.44 billion, respectively. For 2020, $740 million related to future production costs and $529 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. For 2019, $833 million related to future production costs and $606 million\nrelated to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.\nII-49\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nInterest Risk\nInterest on commercial paper borrowings is exposed to risk related to movements in short-term interest rates. A 100 basis point change to the weighted average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings in 2020 would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately $4 million. In addition, interest rates on future long-term debt issuances are exposed to risk related to movements in long-term interest rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify both of these exposures at our discretion. There were no interest rate hedges outstanding at December 31, 2020 or 2019 but in the future we may use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rates.\nAt December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $19.61 billion and the estimated fair value was $24.5 billion. A 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes and debentures by approximately $1.61 billion and $3.28 billion, respectively.\nCredit Risk\nWe continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\nOur receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2020 or 2019, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.\nRelated Parties\nSee Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements."

    "text": "INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE\nThe following Consolidated Financial Statements and schedule of the registrant and its subsidiaries are submitted herewith as part of this report:\nAll other Schedules are omitted since the required information is not present or is not present in amounts sufficient to require submission of the schedule.\nII-51\nMANAGEMENT’ S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. ViacomCBS Inc. and its subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the framework set forth in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nII-52\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ViacomCBS Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ViacomCBS Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nChanges in Accounting Principles\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2018.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nII-53\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAmortization of Internally Produced Television Programming Inventory that is Predominantly Monetized on an Individual Basis\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s internally-produced television programming inventory that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis was $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. For internally-produced television programs that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, management uses an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. The estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues to be earned within 10 years from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. These estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs.\nT\nhe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of internally-produced television programming inventory that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when estimating Ultimate Revenues; this led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures to evaluate management’s estimate of Ultimate Revenues and the significant assumptions related to consideration of the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness\nII-54\nof controls relating to amortization of internally-produced television programming inventory that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis, including the controls over the estimation of Ultimate Revenues. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating Ultimate Revenues, including evaluating whether the significant assumptions were reasonable considering information such as the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs. Procedures were also performed to test the completeness and accuracy of management's data used in these estimates.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 24, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s or its predecessor’s auditor since 1970.\nII-55\nVIACOMCBS INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of Business\n—ViacomCBS Inc. is comprised of the following segments:\nTV Entertainment\n(CBS Television Network; CBS Studios; CBS Media Ventures; CBS-branded streaming services, including CBS All Access, which will be rebranded as Paramount+ in March 2021, and CBSN; CBS Sports Network; and CBS Television Stations),\nCable Networks\n(premium and basic cable networks, including Showtime, BET, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, and Smithsonian Channel, among others; streaming services, including Pluto TV and Showtime OTT; ViacomCBS Networks International, including  Channel 5, Telefe and Network 10) and\nFilmed Entertainment\n(Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation, Paramount Television Studios and Miramax). References to “ViacomCBS”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to ViacomCBS Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nMerger with Viacom Inc.\n—On December 4, 2019, Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) merged with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”), with CBS continuing as the surviving company (the “Merger”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), the combined company changed its name to ViacomCBS Inc. (“ViacomCBS”). At the Effective Time, (1) each share of Viacom Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into\n0.59625\nshares of ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock, and (2) each share of Viacom Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into\n0.59625\nshares of ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock (together with ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock, the “ViacomCBS Common Stock”). At the Effective Time, each share of CBS Class A Common Stock and each share of CBS Class B Common Stock (together with CBS Class A Common Stock, the “CBS Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, remained an issued and outstanding share of ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock and ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock, respectively, and was not affected by the Merger.\nFollowing the Merger, the CBS Common Stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and the Viacom Common Stock ceased trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). On December 5, 2019, ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock and ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock were listed on Nasdaq and began trading under the ticker symbols VIACA and VIAC, respectively.\nThe Merger has been accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control as National Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”) was the controlling stockholder of each of CBS and Viacom (and remains the controlling stockholder of ViacomCBS). Upon the closing of the Merger, the net assets of Viacom were combined with those of CBS at their historical carrying amounts and the companies have been presented on a combined basis for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nDiscontinued Operations\n—On November 25, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our publishing business, Simon & Schuster, to Penguin Random House LLC (“Penguin Random House”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, for $\n2.175\nbillion in cash. As a result, Simon & Schuster has been presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented (see Note 3).\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ViacomCBS, its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where we are considered the primary beneficiary, after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third party participating rights.  Investments over which we have a significant influence, without a controlling interest, are accounted for\nII-61\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nunder the equity method. Our proportionate share of net earnings or loss of the entity is recorded in “Equity in earnings of investee companies, net of tax” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nReclassifications\n—Certain amounts reported for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.\nUse of Estimates\n—The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) pandemic has negatively impacted the macroeconomic environment in the United States and globally, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to the evolving and uncertain nature of COVID-19, it is reasonably possible that it could materially impact our estimates, particularly those that require consideration of forecasted financial information. These estimates relate to certain accounts including, but not limited to, receivables, programming and other inventory, deferred income tax assets, finite and indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill and FCC licenses, and other long-lived assets. The magnitude of the impact will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or control, including the duration and extent of the pandemic, the impact of federal, state, local and foreign governmental actions, consumer behavior in response to the pandemic and such governmental actions, and the economic and operating conditions that we may face in the aftermath of COVID-19.\nBusiness Combinations\n—We generally account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, once control is obtained of a business, 100% of the assets, liabilities and certain contingent liabilities acquired, as well as amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at fair value. Any transaction costs are expensed as incurred. The Merger was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control as NAI was the controlling stockholder of each of CBS and Viacom.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n—Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase, including money market funds, commercial paper and bank time deposits. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had restricted cash of $\n135\nmillion and $\n202\nmillion, respectively, consisting of amounts held in grantor trusts related to agreements with former executives. Restricted cash is included within “Other current assets” and “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nProgramming Inventory\n—We produce and acquire rights to programming to exhibit on our broadcast and cable networks, on our broadcast television stations, direct to consumers through our streaming services, and in theaters. We also produce programming for third parties. Costs for internally-produced and acquired programming inventory, including prepayments for such costs, are recorded within the non-current portion of “Programming and other inventory” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Prepayments for the rights to air sporting and other live events that are expected to be expensed over the next 12 months are classified within the current portion of “Programming and other inventory” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCosts incurred to produce television programs and feature films (which include direct production costs, production overhead, acquisition costs and development costs) are capitalized when incurred and amortized over\nII-62\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nthe projected life of each television program or feature film. Costs incurred to acquire television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing and amortized over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived.\nFor internally-produced television programs and feature films that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, we use an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for participations and residuals over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. The estimate of Ultimate Revenues impacts the timing of amortization of capitalized production costs and expensing of participations and residual costs. For television programming, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues to be earned within\n10\nyears from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production,\n5\nyears from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. These estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs.\nFor feature films, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within\n10\nyears from the date of a film’s initial theatrical release. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. Upon a film’s initial release, we update our estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. For acquired television and film libraries, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is for a period within\n20\nyears from the date of acquisition. Ultimate Revenue estimates are periodically reviewed and adjustments, if any, will result in changes to inventory amortization rates and estimated accruals for residuals and participations.\nFilm development costs that have not been set for production are expensed within\nthree years\nunless they are abandoned earlier, in which case these projects are written down to their estimated fair value in the period the decision to abandon the project is determined.\nFor programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a film group, which includes our acquired programming rights and certain internally-produced television programs, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of the timing of our usage of and benefit from such programming. The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received and amortized over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived based on the relative value of the events broadcast by us during a period. The relative value for an event is determined based on the revenues generated for that event in relation to the estimated total revenues over the remaining term of the sports programming agreement.\nWe test a film group or individual television program or feature film for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its fair value may be less than its unamortized cost. If the carrying value of a film group or individual television program or feature film exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded in the amount of the difference. In addition, unamortized costs for internally-produced or acquired programming that have been substantively abandoned are written off.\nII-63\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nTelevision and feature film programming and production costs, including inventory amortization, development costs, residuals and participations and impairment charges, if any, are included within “Operating expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nProperty and Equipment\n—Property and equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:\nCosts associated with repairs and maintenance of property and equipment are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n—The Company assesses long-lived assets and intangible assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of these asset groups is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups to their net carrying value. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the amount of impairment charge, if any, is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets.\nInvestments\n—Investments over which we have a significant influence, without a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity method. Equity investments for which we have no significant influence are measured at fair value where a readily determinable fair value exists. Equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at cost less impairment, if any, and adjusted for observable price changes. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of equity investments are recorded in “Net gains (losses) from investments” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We monitor our investments for impairment and reduce the carrying value of the investment if we determine that an impairment charge is required based on qualitative and quantitative information.\nOur investments are included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n—Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are at or one level below our operating segments. Intangible assets with finite lives, which primarily consist of trade names, licenses, and customer agreements are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from\n4\nto\n40\nyears. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, which consist primarily of FCC licenses, are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount.  If the carrying value of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized\n(see Note 6).\nGuarantees\n—At the inception of a guarantee, we recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing the guarantee. The related liability is subsequently reduced as utilized or extinguished and increased if there is a probable loss associated with the guarantee which exceeds the value of the recorded liability.\nTreasury Stock\n—Treasury stock is accounted for using the cost method. Retirements of treasury stock are reflected as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nFair Value Measurements\n—Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The framework for measuring fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is\nII-64\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nbased on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Certain assets and liabilities, including foreign currency hedges and deferred compensation liabilities, are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Other assets and liabilities, including television and film production costs, goodwill, intangible assets, and equity-method investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairment charges, if applicable, are determined using discounted cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n—Derivative financial instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in “Other items, net”\nin the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives is recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss\n”\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently recognized in net earnings when the hedged items are recognized.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\n—The service cost component of net benefit cost for our pension and postretirement benefits is recorded on the same line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as other compensation costs of the related employees. All of the other components of net benefit cost are presented separately from the service cost component and below the subtotal of operating income in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOther Liabilities\n—Other liabilities consist primarily of the noncurrent portion of residual liabilities of previously disposed businesses, long-term income tax liabilities, deferred compensation and other employee benefit accruals.\nRevenues\nRevenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer. Control is considered to be transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of that good or service.\nAdvertising Revenues\n—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or displayed on digital platforms. Advertising spots are typically sold as part of advertising campaigns consisting of multiple commercial units. If a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. Audience ratings and impressions are determined based on data provided by independent third-party companies. To the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. For contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.  Advertising contracts, which are generally short-term, are billed monthly, with payments due shortly after the invoice date.\nAdvertising revenues are generated by the\nTV Entertainment\nand\nCable Networks\nsegments.\nII-65\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAffiliate Revenues\n—Affiliate revenues primarily consist of fees received from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and third-party live television streaming services (“virtual MVPDs”) for carriage of our cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”) and television stations (“retransmission fees”); fees from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“reverse compensation”); and subscription fees for our streaming subscription offerings, including CBS All Access (to be rebranded as Paramount+ in March 2021)\n,\nShowtime Networks’ premium subscription streaming service (“Showtime OTT”) and\nBET+. Costs incurred for advertising, marketing and other services provided to us by cable, satellite and other distributors that are in exchange for a distinct service are recorded as expenses. If a distinct service is not received, such costs are recorded as a reduction to revenues.\nThe performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with MVPDs and subscribers to our streaming services, also includes a license to programming for video-on-demand viewing. Affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to\nour customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. These agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”) for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of our programming. For affiliate revenues, payments are generally due monthly.\nAffiliate revenues are generated by the\nTV Entertainment\nand\nCable Networks\nsegments.\nContent Licensing Revenues\n—Content licensing revenues are generated from the licensing of exhibition rights for our internally-produced television and film programming to television stations, cable networks and subscription streaming services; licensing of our content for distribution on transactional video-on-demand services; the distribution of our content through DVD and Blu-ray disc sales to wholesale and retail partners; the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and fees from the distribution of third-party programming.\nFor licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film. Estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues. Agreements to license programming are often long term, with collection terms ranging from\none\nto\nfive years\n.\nWhen payment is due from a customer more than one year before or after revenue is recognized, we consider the contract to contain a significant financing component and the transaction price is adjusted for the effects of the time value of money. We do not adjust the transaction price for the time value of money if payment is expected within one year of recognizing revenues.\nWe also license our programming to distributors of transactional video-on-demand and similar services. Under these arrangements, our performance obligation is the delivery of our content to such distributors who then license our content to the end customer. Our revenues are determined each month based on a contractual rate applied to the number of licenses to the distributors’ end customers. Similarly, revenues earned from electronic sell-through services are recognized as each program is downloaded by the end customer.\nII-66\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenues associated with the licensing of our brands for consumer products, recreation and live events are generally determined based on contractual royalty rates applied to sales reported by the licensees. For consumer products and recreation arrangements that include minimum guaranteed consideration, revenue is recognized as sales occur by the licensee, if the sales-based consideration is expected to exceed the minimum guarantee, or ratably if it is not expected to exceed the minimum guarantee. For live events, we recognize revenue when the event is held.\nRevenues from the sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers are recognized upon the later of the physical delivery to the customer or the date that any sales restrictions on the retailers are lifted.\nWe earn revenues from the distribution of content on behalf of third parties. We also have arrangements for the distribution or sale of our content by third parties. Under such arrangements, we determine whether revenues should be recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer or the net amount of revenue we retain after payment to the third party producer or distributor, based on an assessment of which party controls the good or service being transferred.\nContent licensing revenues are generated by the\nTV Entertainment\n,\nCable Networks\nand\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegments.\nTheatrical Revenues\n—Theatrical revenue is earned from the theatrical distribution of our films during the exhibition period. Under these arrangements, revenues are recognized based on sales to the end customer. Theatrical revenues are generated by the\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment.\nRevenue Allowances\n—DVDs and Blu-ray discs are generally sold with a right of return. We record a provision for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon an estimate of future returns, rebates and other incentives. In determining this provision, we consider sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecast sales data, customers’ rights of return, sales levels for units already shipped, historical return rates for similar products, current economic trends, the competitive environment, promotions and our sales strategies. Reserves for sales returns and allowances of $\n64\nmillion and $\n58\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are recorded in “Other current liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nReserves for accounts receivable reflect our expected credit losses, which are estimated based on historical experience, as well as current and expected economic conditions and industry trends. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $\n85\nmillion and $\n80\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense was $\n32\nmillion in 2020, $\n25\nmillion in 2019 and $\n24\nmillion in 2018.\nContract Liabilities\n—A contract liability is recorded when consideration is received from a customer prior to fully satisfying a performance obligation in a contract. Our contract liabilities primarily consist of cash received related to advertising arrangements for which the required audience rating or impressions have not been delivered; consumer products arrangements with minimum guarantees; and television licensing arrangements under which the content has not yet been made available to the customer. These contract liabilities will be recognized as revenues when control of the related product or service is transferred to the customer. Contract liabilities are included within “Deferred revenues” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCollaborative Arrangements\n—Collaborative arrangements primarily consist of joint efforts with third parties to produce and distribute programming such as television series and live sporting events, including the agreement between us and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. to telecast the\nNCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship\n(the “NCAA Tournament”), which runs through 2032. In connection with this agreement for the\nII-67\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nNCAA Tournament, advertisements aired on the CBS Television Network are recorded as revenues and our share of the program rights fees and other operating costs are recorded as operating expenses.\nWe also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute film and television programming, under which each partner is responsible for distribution of the program in specific territories or distribution windows. Under these arrangements, co-production costs are initially capitalized as programming inventory and amortized over the estimated economic life of the program. In such arrangements where we have distribution rights, all proceeds generated from such distribution are recorded as revenues and any participation profits due to third party collaborators are recorded as participation expenses. In co-production arrangements where third party collaborators have distribution rights, our net participating profits are recorded as revenues.\nAmounts attributable to transactions arising from collaborative arrangements between participants were not material to the consolidated financial statements for any period presented.\nLeases\n—We have operating leases primarily for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities and finance leases for satellite transponders and equipment. We determine that a contract contains a lease if we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of, and the right to direct the use of, an asset identified in the contract. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, we record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability representing the present value of future lease payments. The discount rate used to measure the lease asset and liability is determined at the beginning of the lease term using the rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable, or our collateralized incremental borrowing rate. For those contracts that include fixed rental payments for both the use of the asset (“lease costs”) as well as for other occupancy or service costs relating to the asset (“non-lease costs”), we generally include both the lease costs and non-lease costs in the measurement of the lease asset and liability. We also own buildings and production facilities where we lease space to lessees.\nOur leases generally have remaining terms ranging from\none\nto\n16\nyears and often contain renewal options to extend the lease for periods of generally up to\n10\nyears. For leases that contain renewal options, we include the renewal period in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense and income for our operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with the exception of variable lease costs, which are expensed as incurred, and leases of assets used in the production of programming, which are capitalized in programming assets and amortized over the projected useful life of the related programming. For finance leases, amortization of the right-of-use asset is recognized in amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense is accreted on the lease liability using the effective interest method. This results in an accelerated recognition of cost over the lease term\n.\nAdvertising\n—Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe incurred total advertising expenses of $\n1.31\nbillion in 2020, $\n1.67\nbillion in 2019 and $\n1.39\nbillion in 2018.\nInterest\n—Costs associated with the refinancing or issuance of debt, as well as debt discounts or premiums, are recorded as interest over the term of the related debt.  We may enter into interest rate exchange agreements; the amount to be paid or received under such agreements is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense.\nIncome Taxes\n—The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local, and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary\nII-68\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ndifferences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are classified as noncurrent on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor tax positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized.  A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. We recognize interest and penalty charges related to the reserve for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\n—Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the United States (“U.S.”) Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while results of operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for the respective periods. The resulting translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective July 1, 2018, Argentina has been designated as a highly inflationary economy. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency will result in remeasurement gains and losses, which are included in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNet Earnings (Loss) per Common Share\n—Basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is based upon net earnings (loss) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the effect of the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) only in the periods in which such effect would have been dilutive.\nExcluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive, were stock options and RSUs of\n22\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and\n19\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.\nStock-based Compensation\n—We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.\nII-69\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nChanges to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans\nOn December 31, 2020, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended guidance that eliminates, adds and clarifies certain disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The amendments affect annual disclosures only and are required to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 17 for additional disclosures relating to the adoption of this guidance.\nImprovements to Accounting for Costs of Films and License Agreements for Program Materials\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB guidance on the accounting for costs of films and episodic television series, which aligns the accounting for capitalizing production costs of episodic television series with the guidance for films. As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the capitalization of costs incurred to produce episodic television series is no longer limited to the amount of revenue contracted in the initial market until persuasive evidence of a secondary market exists. In addition, under this guidance our film and television programming is tested for impairment individually on a title-by-title basis, or together with other films and television programming as part of a group, based on the predominant monetization strategy of the film or television programming. Further, for programming monetized in a film group, this guidance requires any changes to the estimated use of the film or television series to be accounted for prospectively. This guidance also eliminates existing balance sheet classification guidance and adds new disclosure requirements relating to costs for acquired and internally-produced programming. As a result of this guidance, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, all of our programming inventory, other than prepayments for the rights to air sporting and other live events, is now classified as noncurrent on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Therefore, $\n1.17\nbillion of programming inventory that was classified in current assets at\nDecember 31, 2019 w\nas reclassified to noncurrent assets on Janua\nry 1, 2020. This guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 5 fo\nr additional disclosures relating to the adoption of this guidance.\nCollaborative Arrangements: Clarifying the Interaction with the New Revenue Standard\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB guidance on the accounting for collaborative arrangements, which clarifies that certain transactions between parties to collaborative arrangements should be accounted for in accordance with FASB revenue guidance when the counterparty is a customer. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCustomer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB guidance on the accounting for implementation costs of a cloud computing arrangement that is considered to be a service contract. This guidance requires companies to follow the guidance for capitalizing costs associated with internal-use software to determine which costs to capitalize in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. Under this guidance, such implementation costs will be capitalized in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with the related amortization presented in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. This guidance was applied prospectively to implementation costs incurred after January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nII-70\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFinancial Instruments\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB guidance on the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. Among other provisions, this guidance introduces a new impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. The guidance applies primarily to our trade and other receivables, and requires the use of a forward-looking “expected loss” model instead of the “incurred loss” model that was used under previous FASB guidance for determining an allowance for credit losses. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nLeases\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we adopted FASB guidance on the accounting for leases, which supersedes previous lease guidance. Under this guidance, for all leases with terms in excess of one year, we recognize on our balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. This guidance retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases and the classification criteria is substantially similar to previous guidance. Additionally, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed. We applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and therefore, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under this guidance while prior periods have not been adjusted. This guidance did not have an impact on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRevenues\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted FASB guidance on the recognition of revenues, which provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The primary impact to our revenue recognition policies resulting from this standard relates to the timing of revenue recognition for the renewal of an existing licensing agreement, which is recognized as revenue when the renewal term begins. Under previous guidance, these revenues were recognized upon the execution of such renewal. In addition, under this standard, revenues for certain distribution arrangements are recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting increase to operating expenses. Under previous accounting guidance, such revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by us after the payment of fees to the third party. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under the new standard while prior periods have not been adjusted. We applied the modified retrospective method of adoption with the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of $\n350\nmillion reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nReference Rate Reform\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued guidance providing optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and may not be applied to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, with a few exceptions for certain hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact of the changes in reference rates and the exemptions and exceptions in this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nII-71\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for income taxes that, among other provisions, eliminates certain exceptions to existing guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also requires an entity to reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in its effective income tax rate in the first interim period that includes the enactment date of the new legislation, aligning the timing of recognition of the effects from enacted tax law changes on the effective income tax rate with the effects on deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Under existing guidance, an entity recognizes the effects of the enacted tax law change on the effective income tax rate in the period that includes the effective date of the tax law. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n2) ACQUISITIONS\nMiramax\nOn April 3, 2020, we acquired a\n49\n% interest in Miramax, a global film and television studio, for $\n375\nmillion, which included a cash payment at closing of approximately $\n150\nmillion along with a commitment to invest $\n45\nmillion annually over the next five years, or $\n225\nmillion, to be used for new film and television productions and working capital. In conjunction with this acquisition, we entered into commercial agreements with Miramax under which we have exclusive, long-term distribution rights to Miramax’s catalog, adding more than\n700\ntitles to our existing library. We also have certain rights to co-produce, co-finance and/or distribute new film and television projects. The investment is accounted for as a consolidated variable interest entity (“VIE”). We are the primary beneficiary of the VIE due to our power to direct the distribution of Miramax’s films and television series, which is considered the most significant activity of the VIE.\nThe following table summarizes our allocation of the purchase price as of the acquisition date.\nII-72\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes, reflects the expected Company-specific synergies arising from the acquisition and is included in the\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment. Intangible assets consist of a trade name with a useful life of\n10\nyears.\nThe operating results of Miramax from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2020 were not material.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring 2019, we acquired Pluto Inc., the provider of Pluto TV, a leading free streaming television service in the U.S., for $\n324\nmillion, net of cash acquired. The purchase price excluded $\n18\nmillion of post-combination expenses that are subject to continuous employment and are recognized over the required service period in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within “Selling, general and administrative expenses”. The results of Pluto TV are included in the\nCable Networks\nsegment from the date of acquisition.\nIn 2019, we acquired the remaining\n50\n% interest in Pop TV, a general entertainment cable network, for $\n39\nmillion, net of cash acquired, bringing our ownership to\n100\n%. The assets acquired primarily consist of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The results of Pop TV are included in the\nCable Networks\nsegment from the date of acquisition.\nIn 2018, we made payments totaling $\n118\nmillion, for acquisitions that included WhoSay Inc., a leading influence marketing firm; Pop Culture Media, a digital entertainment media company; VidCon LLC, a host of conferences dedicated to online video; and Awesomeness TV Holdings, LLC, a multi-platform media company serving global Gen-Z audiences as a digital-first destination for original programming.\nThe operating results of these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements.\n3) DISPOSITIONS\nSimon & Schuster\nOn November 25, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our publishing business, Simon & Schuster, to Penguin Random House for $\n2.175\nbillion in cash. This divestiture follows a strategic review of our non-core assets that was completed in early 2020. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and is expected to close in 2021. Simon & Schuster has been presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.\nThe following tables set forth details of net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nII-73\nVIACOMCBS INC.

(“Famous Players”).\nThe following table presents the major classes of assets and liabilities of our discontinued operations.\nCNET Media Group\nOn October 30, 2020, we completed the sale of CNET Media Group (“CMG”) to Red Ventures for $\n484\nmillion, including an estimated working capital adjustment.\nThe purchase price consisted of a cash payment at closing of\nII-74\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n$\n459\nmillion and a credit of $\n25\nmillion to be used over five years for the purchase of advertising and licensing of data from Red Ventures. This transaction resulted in a gain of $\n214\nmillion ($\n183\nmillion, net of tax).\nCBS Television City\nDuring 2019, we completed the sale of CBS Television City for $\n750\nmillion. We guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first\nfive years\nfollowing the completion of the sale. This transaction resulted in a gain of $\n549\nmillion ($\n386\nmillion, net of tax) for 2019, which included a reduction for the present value of the estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation.\n4\n) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n(a) Accumulated amortization of finance leases was $\n140\nmillion and $\n160\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(a) Amortization expense related to finance leases was $\n18\nmillion, $\n23\nmillion and $\n28\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(b) Included in depreciation expense for 2020 is $\n12\nmillion of accelerated depreciation resulting from the abandonment of technology in connection with synergy plans related to the Merger.\nII-75\nVIACOMCBS INC.

Programming inventory at December 31, 2020 has been grouped according to the predominant monetization strategy in accordance with new FASB guidance adopted in 2020 (see Note 1).\nII-76\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table presents amortization of television and film programming and production costs.\nProgramming Charges\nDuring 2020, we recorded programming charges of $\n159\nmillion primarily related to the abandonment of certain incomplete programs resulting from production shutdowns related to COVID-19. These programming charges are included within the\nTV Entertainment,\nCable Networks\nand\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegments for $\n101\nmillion, $\n53\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion, respectively.\nDuring 2019, in connection with the Merger, we implemented management changes across the organization. In connection with these changes, we performed an evaluation of our programming portfolio across all of our businesses, including an assessment of the optimal use of our programming in the marketplace, which resulted in the identification of programs not aligned with management’s strategy. As a result, we recorded programming charges of $\n589\nmillion principally reflecting accelerated amortization associated with changes in the expected monetization of certain programs, and decisions to cease airing, alter future airing patterns or not renew certain programs.\nDuring 2018, in connection with management changes, we recorded programming charges of $\n162\nmillion relating to changes to our programming strategy, including at CBS Films, which shifted its focus from theatrical films to developing content for our streaming services, as well as at our\nCable Networks\nsegment where we ceased the use of certain programming.\nThe programming charges for 2020, 2019, and 2018 were included within “Operating expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table presents the expected amortization over each of the next three years of released programming inventory on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020.\nWe expect to amortize approximately $\n456\nmillion of our completed, not yet released film inventory, which is monetized on an individual basis, during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n6) GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Test\nWe perform a fair value-based impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television FCC licenses, on an annual basis, and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if\nII-77\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ncircumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.\nFCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2020, we had\n14\ntelevision markets with FCC license book values.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. At December 31, 2020, we had\nfour\nreporting units.\nFor our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for the reporting units and television markets with FCC licenses that management estimates have fair values that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. In making this determination, we also consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2020 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for\n10\nof our television markets and all of our\nreporting units. For each reporting unit, we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. For each television market, we weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors.\nBased on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units and the fair value of FCC licenses within each of these markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.\nA quantitative impairment test of FCC licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, based on an assessment of the relevant factors that could impact the fair value of FCC licenses, including the effects of COVID-19, we determined that an interim impairment test was necessary for\nthree\nmarkets in which we hold FCC licenses. The impairment test indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in\ntwo\nmarkets were lower than their respective carrying values, which resulted from recent declines in industry projections in the markets where these FCC licenses are held, that were further accelerated by COVID-19. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $\n25\nmillion to write down the carrying values of these FCC licenses to their aggregate estimated fair value of $\n216\nmillion. This charge is included within “Depreciation and amortization” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Additionally, the estimated fair value of the FCC license in the third market exceeded its carrying value of $\n53\nmillion by\n7\n%.\nFor the 2020 annual test, which was performed during the fourth quarter, we performed a quantitative impairment test for the three markets tested during the second quarter, as well as a\nfour\nth television market. The impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in the three markets we tested during the second quarter, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $\n269\nmillion at December 31, 2020, were within\n10\n% of their respective carrying values. The fourth market had an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying value by more than\n20\n%.\nII-78\nVIACOMCBS INC.

Shari E. Redstone is the Chairperson, CEO and President of NAI and the non-executive Chair of our Board of Directors. At December 31, 2020, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately\n79.4\n% of our voting Class A Common Stock and\n10.2\n% of our Class A Common Stock and non-voting Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. Until the death of Mr. Sumner M. Redstone on August 11, 2020, NAI was controlled by Mr. Redstone through the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust (the “SMR Trust”), which owned\n80\n% of the voting interest of NAI, with such voting interest voted solely by Mr. Redstone. Upon Mr. Redstone’s death and in accordance with the terms of the trust agreement governing the SMR Trust and the Continuing Trusts (as defined below), the SMR Trust was succeeded by\ntwo\ncontinuing trusts (the “Continuing Trusts”), each of which holds\n40\n% of the voting stock of NAI. Under the terms of the trust agreement governing the SMR Trust and the Continuing Trusts, the Continuing Trusts are required to share the same\nseven\nvoting trustees, who have equal voting power, and each trustee is required to cause each Continuing Trust to vote the NAI shares held by that Continuing Trust in the same manner as the NAI shares held by the other Continuing Trust. Ms. Redstone is one of the\nseven\nvoting trustees for each Continuing Trust and is one of\ntwo\nvoting trustees who are beneficiaries of one of the Continuing Trusts. No member of our management or other member of our Board, is a trustee of either of the Continuing Trusts.\nPursuant to a settlement and release agreement entered into by us, NAI and others, with respect to legal proceedings involving these parties, we paid $\n30\nmillion for professional fees incurred by NAI during 2018\nII-82\nVIACOMCBS INC.

The following tables present the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements related to these transactions.\nThrough the normal course of business, we are involved in transactions with other related parties that have not been material in any of the periods presented.\n9) REVENUES\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated into categories based on the nature of such revenues.\nUnrecognized Revenues Under Contract\nAt December 31, 2020, unrecognized revenues attributable to unsatisfied performance obligations under our long-term contracts was $\n6.79\nbillion, of which $\n3.75\nbillion is expected to be recognized in 2021, $\n2.11\nbillion in 2022, $\n589\nmillion in 2023, and $\n339\nmillion thereafter. These amounts only include contracts subject to a guaranteed fixed amount or the guaranteed minimum under variable contracts, primarily consisting of television and film licensing contracts and affiliate agreements that are subject to a fixed or guaranteed minimum fee. Such amounts change on a regular basis as we renew existing agreements or enter into new agreements. Unrecognized revenues under contract disclosed above do not include (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, mainly consisting of advertising contracts (ii) contracts for which variable consideration is determined based on the customer’s subsequent sale or usage, mainly consisting of affiliate agreements and (iii) long-term licensing agreements for multiple programs for which variable consideration is determined based on the value of the programs delivered to the customer and our right to invoice corresponds with the value delivered.\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied in Previous Periods\nUnder certain licensing arrangements, the amount and timing of our revenue recognition is determined based on our licensees’ subsequent sale to its end customers. As a result, under such arrangements, which primarily include\nII-83\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nlicensing of our content to distributors of transactional video-on-demand and electronic sell-through services, we often satisfy our performance obligation of delivery of our content in advance of revenue recognition. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized revenues of $\n250\nmillion, $\n235\nmillion, and $\n172\nmillion, respectively, in our\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment for performance obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in a prior period.\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities were $\n1.12\nbillion, $\n908\nmillion and $\n743\nmillion at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively and are included within “Deferred revenues” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in contract liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflects $\n591\nmillion of revenues recognized that were included in deferred revenues at December 31, 2019 partially offset by cash payments received during the period for which the performance obligation was not satisfied prior to the end of the period. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized revenues of $\n498\nmillion that were included in deferred revenues at December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized revenues of $\n558\nmillion that were included in deferred revenues at December 31, 2017.\nReceivables\nIncluded in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are noncurrent receivables of $\n2.02\nbillion and $\n2.15\nbillion at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Noncurrent receivables primarily relate to revenues recognized under long-term television licensing arrangements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, while the related cash is collected over the term of the license period. The year of origination for these receivables at December 31, 2020 was $\n1.02\nbillion in 2020, $\n608\nmillion in 2019, $\n299\nmillion in 2018, $\n82\nmillion in 2017, and $\n15\nmillion for 2016 and prior.\nOur receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2020 and 2019, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.\nII-84\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n10)  DEBT\nOur debt consists of the following\n:\n(a) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the senior and junior subordinated debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of $\n491\nmillion and $\n412\nmillion, respectively, and (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of $\n107\nmillion and $\n92\nmillion, respectively. The face value of our total debt was $\n20.33\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and $\n19.23\nbillion at December 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued $\n4.50\nbillion of senior notes with interest rates ranging from\n4.20\n% to\n4.95\n% and due dates from 2025 to 2050. The net proceeds from these issuances are being used for the redemption of our long-term debt as well as for general corporate purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2020\n,\nwe redeemed, prior to maturity, senior notes, debentures, and junior subordinated debentures totaling $\n2.77\nII-85\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nbillion, for an aggregate redemption price of $\n2.88\nbillion. These redemptions resulted in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n126\nmillion ($\n97\nmillion, net of tax).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued $\n500\nmillion of\n4.20\n% senior notes due 2029. We used the net proceeds from this issuance in the redemption of our $\n600\nmillion outstanding\n2.30\n% senior notes due August 2019. During 2019, we also repaid the $\n220\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n5.625\n% senior notes due September 2019 and the $\n90\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n2.75\n% senior notes due December 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we redeemed $\n1.13\nbillion of senior notes and debentures for a redemption price of $\n1.10\nbillion, resulting in a pre-tax gain on extinguishment of debt of $\n18\nmillion ($\n14\nmillion, net of tax).\nOur\n5.875\n% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 and\n6.25\n% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rates until February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2027, respectively, on which dates the rates will switch to floating rates based on three-month LIBOR plus\n3.895\n% and\n3.899\n%, respectively, reset quarterly. These debentures can be called by us at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period.\nThe interest rate payable on our\n2.25\n% senior notes due February 2022 and\n3.45\n% senior notes due October 2026, collectively the “Senior Notes”, will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the Senior Notes. The interest rate on these Senior Notes would increase by\n0.25\n% upon each credit agency downgrade up to a maximum of\n2.00\n%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. At December 31, 2020, the outstanding principal amount of our\n2.25\n% senior notes due February 2022 and\n3.45\n% senior notes due October 2026 was $\n35\nmillion and $\n124\nmillion, respectively.\nSome of our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures.\nAt December 31, 2020, our scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding finance leases, and the related interest payments were as follows:\nCommercial Paper\nIn January 2020, our commercial paper program was increased to $\n3.50\nbillion from $\n2.50\nbillion in conjunction with the new $\n3.50\nbillion revolving credit facility described below. At December 31, 2020, we had\nno\noutstanding commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2019, we had $\n699\nmillion outstanding commercial paper borrowings under our commercial paper program at a weighted average interest rate of\n2.07\n% and maturities of less than\n90\ndays.\nCredit Facility\nIn January 2020, the $\n2.50\nbillion revolving credit facility held by CBS prior to the Merger, with a maturity in June 2021, was terminated and the revolving credit facility held by Viacom prior to the Merger, with a maturity in\nII-86\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFebruary 2024, was amended and restated to a $\n3.50\nbillion revolving credit facility with a maturity in January 2025 (the “Credit Facility”). The credit facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper outstanding, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at our option at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or LIBOR plus a margin based on our senior unsecured debt rating, depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered. The Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to be less than\n4.5\nx (which we may elect to increase to\n5.0\nx for up to four consecutive quarters following a qualified acquisition) at the end of each quarter. The Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. We met the covenant as of December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $\n3.50\nbillion.\nOther Bank Borrowings\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $\n95\nmillion of bank borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of\n3.50\n% under Miramax’s $\n300\nmillion credit facility, which matures in April 2023.\n11) LEASES\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to our leases.\nII-87\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nLessee Contracts\nWe have operating leases primarily for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities. We also have finance leases for satellite transponders and equipment. Lease costs are generally fixed, with certain contracts containing variable payments for non-lease costs based on usage and escalations in the lessors’ annual costs.\nThe following table presents our lease cost.\n(a) Includes fixed lease costs and non-lease costs (consisting of other occupancy and service costs relating to the use of an asset) associated with long-term operating leases.\n(b) Includes costs capitalized in programming assets during the period for leased assets used in the production of programming.\n(c) Short-term leases, which are not recorded in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, have a term of 12 months or less and exclude month-to-month leases.\n(d) Primarily includes non-lease costs (consisting of other occupancy and service costs relating to the use of an asset) and costs for equipment leases that vary based on usage.\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow information related to our leases.\nII-88\nVIACOMCBS INC.

Lease payments received under these agreements consist of fixed payments for the rental of space and certain building operating costs, as well as variable payments based on usage of production facilities and services, and escalating costs of building operations. We recorded total lease income of $\n133\nmillion and $\n148\nmillion, including both fixed and variable amounts, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020, future fixed lease income under noncancellable operating leases is as follows:\n12) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe carrying value of our financial instruments approximates fair value, except for notes and debentures.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $\n19.61\nbillion and $\n17.98\nbillion, respectively, and the fair value, which is determined based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) was $\n24.5\nbillion and $\n20.6\nbillion, respectively.\nWe use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nInvestments\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had investments of $\n601\nmillion and $\n753\nmillion, respectively, consisting of equity-method investments, equity investments without a readily determinable fair value and marketable\nII-89\nVIACOMCBS INC.

We contributed $\n59\nmillion\n,\n$\n171\nmillion and $\n161\nmillion to our investments during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur equity method investments include a\n50\n% interest in the broadcast network, The CW, as well as interests in several international television joint ventures including a\n49\n% interest in Viacom18, a joint venture in India which owns and operates COLORS pay television channel, a digital advertising platform and a filmed entertainment business. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, we had $\n536\nmillion and $\n494\nmillion of equity-method investments. For the year ended December 31, 2020, “Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations includes an impairment charge of $\n9\nmillion relating to an international television joint venture.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, we had $\n65\nmillion and $\n113\nmillion of equity investments without a readily determinable fair value. During 2020, we recorded a gain of $\n213\nmillion related to an increase in the value of our investment in fuboTV, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2020. For 2020, 2019, and 2018, included in “Net gains (losses) from investments” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations was $\n7\nmillion, $\n50\nmillion and\n$\n46\nmillion, respectively, for the impairment of investments without a readily determinable fair value.\nDuring 2020, we sold marketable securities for proceeds of $\n146\nmillion. We did not have any marketable securities at December 31, 2020. The fair value of our marketable securities was $\n146\nmillion at December 31, 2019 as determined based on quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy). For 2019  and 2018, included in “Net gains (losses) from investments” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations was an unrealized gain of $\n113\nmillion and an unrealized loss of $\n23\nmillion, respectively, resulting from changes in the fair value of our marketable securities.\nIn 2019, we completed the sale of an international joint venture resulting in a gain of $\n10\nmillion.

These gains have been included in “Net gains (losses) from investments” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nForeign exchange forward contracts have principally been used to hedge projected cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, generally for periods up to\n24\nmonths. We designate foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $\n1.27\nbillion and $\n1.44\nbillion, respectively. For 2020, $\n740\nmillion related to future production costs and $\n529\nmillion\nrelated to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. For 2019, $\n833\nmillion related to future production costs and $\n606\nmillion related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.\nLosses recognized on derivative financial instruments were as follows:\nII-90\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe fair value of our derivative instruments was not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets for any of the periods presented.\nWe continually monitor our position with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\n13) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following tables set forth the balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019 of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These assets and liabilities have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. We do not have any assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using level 3 inputs.\nThe fair value of foreign currency hedges is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using observable inputs including foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of deferred compensation liabilities is determined based on the fair value of the investments elected by employees. The fair value of marketable securities at December 31, 2019 was determined based on quoted market prices in active markets.\n14) STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nIn general, ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock and ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock have the same economic rights; however, holders of ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock do not have any voting rights, except as required by law.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)—\nThe following table presents the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n(a) Reflects cumulative translation adjustments.\n(b) Reflects amortization of net actuarial losses and prior service cost.\n(c) Reflects the reclassification of certain income tax effects of federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017 (the “Tax Reform Act”) on items within accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings upon the adoption of new FASB guidance.\nThe net actuarial loss and prior service cost related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans included in other comprehensive income (loss) is net of a tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 of $\n1\nmillion, $\n44\nmillion and $\n23\nmillion, respectively.\n15) STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe have equity incentive plans (the “Plans”) under which stock options, RSUs and market-based performance share units (“PSUs”) are issued. The purpose of the Plans is to benefit and advance the interests of our company by attracting, retaining and motivating participants and to compensate participants for their contributions to the financial success of our company. The Plans provide for awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted shares, RSUs, dividend equivalents, performance awards and other equity-related awards. RSUs and PSUs accrue dividends each time we declare a quarterly cash dividend, which are paid upon vesting when the shares are delivered and are forfeited if the award does not vest. Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs and PSUs, we issue new shares from our existing authorization. At December 31, 2020, there were\n33\nmillion shares available for future grant under the Plans. Stock-based compensation awards were also granted under Viacom’s equity incentive plans until December 31, 2020. Upon exercise of outstanding stock\nII-93\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\noptions or vesting of RSUs and PSUs under Viacom’s equity incentive plans, shares will be issued from Viacom’s existing authorization or from treasury stock.\nAt the Effective Time of the Merger, each RSU for Viacom Class B common stock was converted into\n0.59625\nRSUs for ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock and each outstanding stock option for Viacom Class B common stock was converted into\n0.59625\noptions for ViacomCBS Class B common stock. The exercise price of stock options was adjusted by dividing the exercise price of the Viacom stock options by\n0.59625\n. RSU and stock option information is presented herein as if Viacom and CBS had been combined for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n(a) Reflects accelerations as a result of restructuring activities, as well as accelerations triggered by the Merger in 2019, and forfeitures related to changes in senior management in 2018.\nIncluded in net earnings from discontinued operations was stock-based compensation expense of $\n10\nmillion, $\n5\nmillion, and $\n4\nmillion for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nRSUs and PSUs\nCompensation expense for RSUs is determined based upon the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, which is generally a\none\n- to\nfour\n-year service period. Certain RSU awards are also subject to satisfying internal performance conditions. Compensation expense is recorded based on the probable outcome of the internal performance conditions. Forfeitures for RSUs are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates. We adjust the compensation expense based on actual forfeitures and on an annual basis we revise the forfeiture rate as necessary.\nDuring 2020 and 2018, we also granted PSU awards. For the 2020 awards, the number of shares to be issued upon vesting of the PSUs is based on the total shareholder return of ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock measured against the companies comprising the S&P 500 Index over a designated measurement period. For the 2018 awards, the number of shares to be issued upon vesting of the PSUs was based on the total shareholder return of Viacom Class B Common Stock measured against the companies comprising the S&P 500 Index over a designated measurement period, as well as the achievement of established operating goals. The fair value of PSU awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense for PSUs is expensed over the required employee service period. The fair value of the PSU awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2018 was $\n34\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion, respectively. There were\nno\nPSU awards granted in 2019. At the Effective Time of the Merger, all outstanding PSU awards for which the performance period had not been completed were converted into time-based RSUs based on the target number of shares included in the terms of the original PSU award.\nII-94\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs and PSUs granted was $\n32.35\n,\n$\n41.71\nand $\n51.41\nin 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The total market value of RSUs that vested during 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $\n222\nmillion, $\n159\nmillion and $\n158\nmillion, respectively. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs and PSUs at December 31, 2020 was $\n358\nmillion which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n2.9\nyears.\nThe following table summarizes our RSU and PSU share activity:\n(a) Grant activity includes\n1\nmillion of performance-based share units at target for 2020.\nStock Options\nCompensation expense for stock options is determined based on the grant date fair value of the award calculated using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. Stock options generally vest over a\nthree\n- to\nfour\n-year service period and expire\neight years\nfrom the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates. We adjust the compensation expense based on actual forfeitures.\nThere were\nno\nstock option grants during 2020 and 2019.\nIn 2018, the weighted average fair value of stock options granted for CBS Class B Common Stock as of the grant date was $\n14.48\n.\nThe fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:\nThe weighted average fair value of stock options granted for Viacom Class B Common Stock as of the grant date, adjusted by the conversion ratio of\n0.59625\n, was $\n13.77\nin 2018.\nThe fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions in effect for Viacom at the time of grant:\nThe expected stock price volatility for stock options for CBS Class B Common Stock was determined using a weighted average of historical volatility for CBS Class B Common Stock and implied volatility of publicly traded options to purchase CBS Class B Common Stock. The expected stock price volatility for stock options for\nII-95\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nViacom Class B Common Stock was principally determined based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options to purchase Viacom Class B Common Stock. Given the existence of an actively traded market for CBS and Viacom options prior to the closing of the Merger, we were able to derive implied volatility using publicly traded options that were trading near the grant date of the employee stock options at a similar exercise price and a remaining term of greater than\none year\n.\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury rate in effect on the date of grant with a term equal to the expected term. The expected term is determined based on historical employee exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected dividend yield represents our future expectation of the annual dividend yield based on the dividend rate on the grant date and historical patterns of dividend changes.\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards at December 31, 2020 was $\n13\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.4\nyears.\nThe following table summarizes our stock option activity under the Plans.\nThe following table summarizes other information relating to stock option exercises during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nAt December 31, 2020, stock options outstanding and exercisable have a weighted average remaining contractual life of\n3.10\nyears and\n2.79\nyears, respectively. There was\nno\nintrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable, based on our closing stock price of $\n37.26\n.\n16) INCOME TAXES\nThe U.S. and foreign components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies were as follows:\nII-96\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes were as follows:\nIn addition, included in net earnings from discontinued operations was an income tax provision of $\n38\nmillion, $\n32\nmillion and $\n47\nmillion for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe equity in loss of investee companies is shown net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The tax  benefits relating to losses from equity investments was $\n19\nmillion in both 2020 and 2019 and $\n15\nmillion in 2018, which represented an effective tax rate of\n40.4\n%,\n26.4\n% and\n24.2\n% for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe difference between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and the provision (benefit) for income taxes is summarized as follows:\n(a) Reflects a deferred tax benefit resulting from the transfer of intangible assets between our subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations. The related deferred tax asset is primarily expected to be realized over a 25-year period.\n(b) Reflects tax benefits realized in connection with the preparation of the 2018 federal tax return, based on further clarity provided by the United States government on tax positions relating to the Tax Reform Act.\n(c) 2018 includes the reversal of a valuation allowance of $\n140\nmillion relating to capital loss carryforwards that were utilized in connection with the sale of CBS Television City in 2019.\nII-97\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table summarizes the components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\nIn addition to the amounts reflected in the table above, included in “Assets of discontinued operations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are net deferred income tax assets of $\n93\nmillion and $\n76\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $\n29\nmillion and net operating loss carryforwards for federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions of approximately $\n2.06\nbillion, the majority of which expire in various years from 2021 through 2040.\nThe 2020 and 2019 deferred income tax assets were reduced by a valuation allowance of $\n593\nmillion and $\n547\nmillion, respectively, principally relating to income tax benefits from capital losses and net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions which are not expected to be realized.\nIn March 2020, the U.S. government enacted tax legislation containing provisions to support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic (the “CARES Act”), including deferment of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes, refundable payroll tax credits, and technical amendments to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2020. We do not expect the future impact of the CARES Act provisions to be material.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Reform Act which contained significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35%\nto\n21% and a one-time transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits. During 2017, we recorded a provisional charge associated with the estimated transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits. We completed our analysis of this transition tax in 2018 and as a result, recorded a charge of $\n48\nmillion in 2018 to adjust the provisional amount. In January 2019, the U.S. government issued guidance relating to the transition tax, which resulted in a decrease of $\n146\nII-98\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nmillion to our reserve for uncertain tax positions during 2019 for amounts paid as a result of this guidance; however, it did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Tax Reform Act includes a deduction for foreign derived intangible income and a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), which imposes a U.S. tax on certain income earned by our foreign subsidiaries. We elected to treat the tax on GILTI as a period cost when incurred and therefore, the tax on GILTI is included in our tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nGenerally, the future remittance of foreign undistributed earnings will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes under the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and as a result, for substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries, we do not intend to assert indefinite reinvestment of both cash held outside of the U.S. and future cash earnings. However, a future repatriation of cash could be subject to state and local income taxes, foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes. Accordingly, we recorded deferred income tax liabilities associated with future repatriations, which were not material to the consolidated financial statements. Additional income taxes have not been provided for outside basis differences inherent in these entities, which could be recognized upon sale or other transaction, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely invested in foreign operations. The determination of the U.S. federal deferred income tax liability for such outside basis difference is not practicable.\nThe following table sets forth the change in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, excluding related accrued interest and penalties.\nThe reserve for uncertain tax positions of $\n308\nmillion at December 31, 2020 includes $\n281\nmillion which would affect our effective income tax rate, including discontinued operations, if and when recognized in future years.\nWe recognize interest and penalty charges related to the reserve for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. We recognized interest and penalties of $\n16\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $\n24\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of\nII-99\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, we have recorded liabilities for accrued interest and penalties of $\n57\nmillion and $\n51\nmillion, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nViacomCBS and its subsidiaries file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and various state and international jurisdictions. For periods prior to the Merger, Viacom and CBS filed separate tax returns. For CBS, the IRS commenced its examination of the 2017 tax year during the fourth quarter of 2019 and commenced its examination of the 2018 tax year in February 2020. For Viacom, the IRS began its examination of the 2014 and 2015 tax years in April 2017. Various tax years are also currently under examination by state and local and foreign tax authorities. With respect to open tax years in all jurisdictions, we currently believe that it is reasonably possible that the reserve for uncertain tax positions may decrease by $\n50\nmillion within the next 12 months primarily related to potential resolutions of matters involving multiple tax periods and jurisdictions; however, it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter and events could cause our current expectation to change in the future.\n17) PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nViacomCBS and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans, principally non-contributory, covering eligible employees. Our pension plans consist of both funded and unfunded plans. The majority of participants in these plans are retired employees or former employees of previously divested businesses. In November 2020, our remaining defined benefit pension plans subject to benefit accruals, which were sponsored by CBS prior to the merger, were amended to freeze future benefit accruals and benefits were enhanced under defined contribution plans that were previously sponsored by CBS, both of which are effective January 1, 2021. As a result of the pension plan amendments, a curtailment gain of $\n79\nmillion associated with the elimination of benefit accruals for future services of the impacted employees, is reflected in unrecognized actuarial loss included within “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The benefits for some plans are based primarily on an employee’s years of service and average pay near retirement. Benefits under other plans are based primarily on an employee’s pay for each year that the employee participated in the plan. We fund our pension plans in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and other applicable rules and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of corporate bonds, equity securities, common collective trust funds and U.S. government securities. ViacomCBS Common Stock represented approximately\n1.8\n% and\n2.1\n% of the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn addition, ViacomCBS sponsors health and welfare plans that provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees and their covered dependents. Eligibility is based in part on certain age and service requirements at the time of their retirement. Most of the plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance which are adjusted annually, as well as caps on the annual dollar amount we will contribute toward the cost of coverage. Claims and premiums for which we are responsible are paid with our own funds.\nThe pension plan disclosures herein include information related to our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans only, unless otherwise noted. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Consolidated Balance Sheets also include a liability of $\n77\nmillion and $\n80\nmillion, respectively, in “Pension and postretirement benefit obligations” relating to our non-U.S. pension plans and certain other retirement severance plans.\nWe use a December 31 measurement date for all pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nII-100\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table sets forth the change in benefit obligation for our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nThe actuarial loss of $\n408\nmillion, included in the change in benefit obligation for pension benefits in 2020, is primarily the result of a\n60\nbasis point decrease in the discount rate from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.\nThe following table sets forth the change in plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nThe funded status of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nOur qualified pension plans were underfunded by $\n712\nmillion and $\n734\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nII-101\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following amounts were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n5.16\nbillion and $\n4.87\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nInformation for the pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets is set forth below.\nThe following tables present the components of net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\n(a) Includes amounts reflected in net earnings from discontinued operations of $\n5\nmillion for 2020, $\n6\nmillion for 2019 and $\n3\nmillion for 2018\n.\nThe service cost component of net periodic cost is presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations within operating income. All other components of net periodic cost are presented below operating income, in “Other items, net.”\nII-102\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nN/A - not applicable\nThe discount rates are determined primarily based on the yield of a portfolio of high quality bonds, providing cash flows necessary to meet the pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligations. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets.\nThe following additional assumptions were used in accounting for postretirement benefits.\nPlan Assets\nPrior to the Merger, the investments committees of Viacom and CBS determined the strategies for the investment of pension plan assets. These committees established target asset allocations for our pension plan trusts based upon an analysis of the timing and amount of projected benefit payments, projected company contributions, the expected returns and risk of the asset classes and the correlation of those returns. The target asset allocation for\nII-103\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCBS’s domestic pension plans is to invest between\n70\n% -\n80\n% in long duration fixed income investments,\n16\n% -\n28\n% in equity securities and the remainder in cash and other investments. At December 31, 2020, this trust was invested approximately\n73\n% in long duration fixed income securities,\n25\n% in equity investments, and the remainder in cash, cash equivalents and other investments. Long duration fixed income investments consist of a diversified portfolio of fixed income instruments that are substantially investment grade, with a duration that approximates the duration of the liabilities covered by the trust. All equity portfolios are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. equities and include large and small capitalization equities. The asset allocations are reviewed regularly.\nThe target asset allocation for Viacom’s domestic pension plans is to invest\n70\n% -\n90\n% in return-seeking investments,\n10\n% -\n30\n% in liability hedging and\n0\n% -\n10\n% in cash and cash equivalents. Return-seeking investments consist of diversified equity and credit funds and liability hedging investments consist of U.S. treasury rate funds. At December 31, 2020, the Viacom Pension Plan was invested\n78\n% in return seeking,\n21\n% in liability hedging and\n1\n% in cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following tables set forth our pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2020 and 2019. These assets have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on quoted prices for the asset in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset. There are no investments categorized as Level 3.\nII-104\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a)  Assets categorized as Level 2 reflect investments in money market funds.\n(b)  Securities of diverse sectors and industries, substantially all investment grade.\n(c)  In accordance with FASB guidance investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n(d)  Underlying investments consist mainly of U.S. large capitalization and international equity securities.\nMoney market investments are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these investments. Investments in equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges. The fair value of investments in common collective funds and mutual funds are determined using the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the administrator of the fund as a practical expedient. The NAV is determined by each fund’s trustee based upon the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, less liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding units. The fair value of U.S. treasury securities is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets. The fair value of government related securities and corporate bonds is determined based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges, when available, or using valuation models which incorporate certain other observable inputs including recent trading activity for comparable securities and broker quoted prices. The fair value of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities is based upon valuation models which incorporate available dealer quotes, projected cash flows and market information. The fair value of limited partnerships has been estimated using the NAV of the ownership interest. The NAV is determined using quarterly financial statements issued by the partnership which determine the value based on the fair value of the underlying investments.\nFuture Benefit Payments\nEstimated future benefit payments are as follows:\nIn 2021, we expect to make contributions of approximately $\n15\nmillion to our qualified pension plans for minimum funding requirements under ERISA and $\n86\nmillion to our non-qualified pension plans to satisfy\nII-105\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nbenefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2021, we expect to contribute approximately $\n39\nmillion to our other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy our portion of benefit payments due under these plans.\nMultiemployer Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees including talent, writers, directors, producers and other employees, primarily in the entertainment industry. The other employers participating in these multiemployer plans are primarily in the entertainment and other related industries. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans as assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. In addition, if we choose to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan.\nThe financial health of a multiemployer plan is indicated by the zone status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Plans in the red zone are in critical status; those in the yellow zone are in endangered status; and those in the green zone are neither critical nor endangered.\nThe table below presents information concerning our participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans.\n(a) The Zone status for each individual plan listed was certified by each plan’s actuary as of the beginning of the plan years for 2020 and 2019. The plan year is the twelve months ending December 31 for each plan listed above except AFTRA Retirement Plan which has a plan year ending November 30.\n(b) The Company was listed in AFTRA Retirement Plan’s Form 5500 as providing more than 5% of total contributions for the plan year ended November 30, 2019.\n(c) The expiration dates range from\nJune 30, 2020\nthrough\nJune 30, 2021\n.\n(d) The expiration dates range from\nMay 15, 2021\nthrough\nMarch 2, 2022\n.\n(e) The Company was listed in I.A.T.S.E. Local No. 33 Pension Trust Fund’s Form 5500 as providing more than 5% of total contributions for the plan year ended December 31, 2019.\nAs a result of the above noted zone status there were no funding improvements or rehabilitation plans implemented, as defined by ERISA, nor any surcharges imposed for any of the individual plans listed.\nWe also contribute to multiemployer plans that provide postretirement healthcare and other benefits to certain employees under collective bargaining agreements. The contributions to these plans were $\n95\nmillion, $\n89\nmillion and $\n74\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nII-106\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nWe recognize the net periodic cost for multiemployer pension and postretirement benefit plans based on the required contributions to the plans.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe sponsor defined contribution plans for the benefit of substantially all employees meeting eligibility requirements. Employer contributions to such plans were $\n91\nmillion, $\n95\nmillion and $\n87\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n18) REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST\nWe are subject to a redeemable put option, payable in a foreign currency, with respect to an international subsidiary. The put option expires in December 2022 and is classified as “Redeemable noncontrolling interest” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe activity reflected within redeemable noncontrolling interest for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented below.\n19) SEGMENT AND REVENUE INFORMATION\nThe following tables set forth our financial performance by reportable segment. Our operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments, have been determined in accordance with our internal management structure, which is organized based upon products and services.\nOn November 25, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House. As a result, Simon & Schuster, which was previously reported as the\nPublishing\nsegment, has been presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. See Note 3.\nII-107\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenues generated between segments primarily reflect advertising and content licensing. These transactions are recorded at market value as if the sales were to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation.\nII-108\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nWe present operating income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and gain on sales, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. We believe the presentation of Adjusted OIBDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by our management and enhances their ability to understand our operating performance. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management.\nII-109\nVIACOMCBS INC.

This tax liability reflects the remaining tax on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS in 2024 and 2025.\nII-110\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAt December 31, 2020, commitments for programming and talent and purchase obligations not recorded on the balance sheet, and other long-term contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet were payable as follows:\nWe also have long-term operating and finance lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders and studio facilities, which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020. See Note 11 for details of our operating and finance lease commitments.\nGuarantees\nLetters of Credit and Surety Bonds.\nWe have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2020, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $\n144\nmillion and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCBS Television City\n.  In connection with the sale of CBS Television City in 2019, we guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first\nfive years\nfollowing the completion of the sale. Included in “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020 is a liability of $\n100\nmillion, reflecting the present value of the remaining estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation.\nLease Guarantees.\nWe have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players. These lease commitments amounted to $\n67\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, and are presented within “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of lease commitments varies over time depending on expiration or termination of individual underlying leases, or the related indemnification obligation, and foreign exchange rates, among other things. We may also have exposure for certain other expenses related to the leases, such as property taxes and common area maintenance. We believe our accrual is sufficient to meet any future obligations based on our consideration of available financial information, the lessees’ historical performance in meeting their lease obligations and the underlying economic factors impacting the lessees’ business models.\nIn the course of our business, we both provide and receive indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. We record a liability for our indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.\nII-111\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nLegal Matters\nGeneral\nOn an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\nBeginning on February 20, 2020, three purported CBS stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. On March 31, 2020, the Court consolidated the\nthree\nlawsuits and appointed Bucks County Employees’ Retirement Fund and International Union of Operating Engineers of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action. On April 14, 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a Verified Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against Shari E. Redstone, NAI, Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust, members of the CBS Board of Directors (comprised of Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Brian Goldner, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and nominal defendant ViacomCBS Inc. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to CBS stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 13, 2019, as amended on October 16, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”). The Complaint also alleges waste and unjust enrichment in connection with Mr. Ianniello’s compensation. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. On June 5, 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. On January 27, 2021, the Court dismissed one disclosure claim, while allowing all other claims against the defendants to proceed. Discovery on the surviving claims will now proceed. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.\nBeginning on November 25, 2019, four purported Viacom stockholders filed separate putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. On January 23, 2020, the Court consolidated the\nfour\nlawsuits. On February 6, 2020, the Court appointed California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. On February 28, 2020, CalPERS, together with Park Employees’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and Louis M. Wilen, filed a First Amended Verified Class Action Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against NAI, NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the Viacom special transaction committee of the Viacom Board of Directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. On May 22, 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. On December 29, 2020, the Court dismissed the claims against Mr. Bakish, while allowing the claims against the remaining defendants to proceed. Discovery on the surviving claims will now proceed. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.\nII-112\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nInvestigation-Related Matters\nAs announced on August 1, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors retained\ntwo\nlaw firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in press reports about CBS’ former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at CBS. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors announced the completion of its investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the CBS Board of Directors’ determination, discussed below, with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’ employment. We have received subpoenas from the New York County District Attorney’s Office and the New York City Commission on Human Rights regarding the subject matter of this investigation and related matters. The New York State Attorney General’s Office and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission have also requested information about these matters, including with respect to CBS’ related public disclosures. We may continue to receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future. We are cooperating with these inquiries.\nOn August 27, 2018 and on October 1, 2018, Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. On November 6, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On November 30, 2018, the Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. On February 11, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against CBS, certain current and former senior executives and members of the CBS Board of Directors. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of CBS Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On April 12, 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss this action, which the Court granted in part and denied in part on January 15, 2020. With the exception of one statement made by Mr. Moonves at an industry event in November 2017, in which he allegedly was acting as the agent of CBS, all claims as to all other allegedly false and misleading statements were dismissed. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.\nSeparation Agreement\nOn September 9, 2018, CBS entered into a separation and settlement agreement and releases (the “Separation Agreement”) with Mr. Moonves, pursuant to which Mr. Moonves resigned as a director and as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of CBS. In October 2018, we contributed $\n120\nmillion to a grantor trust pursuant to the Separation Agreement. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors announced that, following its consideration of the findings of the investigation referred to above, it had determined that there were grounds to terminate Mr. Moonves’ employment for cause under his employment agreement with CBS. Any dispute related to the CBS Board of Directors’ determination is subject to binding arbitration as set forth in the Separation Agreement. On January 16, 2019, Mr. Moonves commenced a binding arbitration proceeding with respect to this matter and the related CBS Board of Directors investigation, which proceeding is ongoing. The assets of the grantor trust will remain in the trust until a final determination in the arbitration. We are currently unable to determine the outcome of the arbitration and the amount, if any, that may be awarded thereunder. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.\nII-113\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nLitigation Related to Television Station Owners\nOn September 9, 2019, the Company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning on or about January 1, 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly competitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The action, which names the Company among\nfourteen\ntotal defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. On October 8, 2019, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the matter, which was denied by the court on November 6, 2020. We believe that the claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.\nClaims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos\nWe are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.\nClaims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2020, we had pending approximately\n30,710\nasbestos claims, as compared with approximately\n30,950\nas of December 31, 2019 and\n31,570\nas of December 31, 2018. During 2020, we received approximately\n2,910\nnew claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately\n3,150\nclaims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2020 and 2019 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $\n35\nmillion and $\n58\nmillion, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.\nFilings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe that our accrual and insurance are sufficient to cover our asbestos liabilities. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and\nII-114\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nthe filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.\nOther\nFrom time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.\n21) SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe following table presents the components of Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nVariable Interest Entities\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into joint ventures or make investments with business partners that support our underlying business strategy and provide us the ability to enter new markets to expand the reach of our brands, develop new programming and/or distribute our existing content. In certain instances, an entity in which we make an investment may qualify as a VIE. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we assess whether we have the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheets include assets and liabilities related to consolidated VIEs totaling $\n1.39\nbillion and $\n197\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2020, and $\n141\nmillion and $\n22\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Revenues and operating income from our consolidated VIEs were $\n705\nmillion and $\n498\nmillion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenues and operating income from our consolidated VIEs were not significant for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in amounts related to our consolidated VIEs reflects the acquisition of Miramax (see Note 2) and the licensing of the streaming rights to\nSouth Park\nby a consolidated\n51\n%-owned VIE in the second quarter of 2020.\nII-115\nVIACOMCBS INC.
