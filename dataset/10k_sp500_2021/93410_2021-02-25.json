    "text": "General Development of Business\nSummary Description of Chevron\nChevron Corporation,\n*\na Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products and lubricants; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.\nA list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented in Exhibit 21.1 on page E-1.\nOverview of Petroleum Industry\nPetroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.\nStrong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals.\nOperating Environment\nRefer to pages 31 through 38 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s current business environment and outlook.\nChevron’s Strategic Direction\nChevron’s primary objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. In the upstream, the company’s strategy is to deliver industry-leading returns while developing high-value resource opportunities. In the downstream, the company’s strategy is to be the leading downstream and chemicals company that delivers on customer needs. In seeking to help advance a lower carbon future, Chevron is focused on lowering its carbon intensity cost efficiently, increasing renewables and offsets in support of its business, and investing in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions.\nInformation about the company is available on the company’s website at\nwww.chevron.com\n. Information contained on the company’s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the company’s website soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the SEC’s website at\nwww.sec.gov\n.\n________________________________________________________\n*\nIncorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,” “us” and \"its\" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or non-equity method investments. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.\n3\nHuman Capital Management\nChevron is focused on investing in its employees and its culture. Chevron hires, develops, and strives to retain critical talent, and fosters a culture that values diversity and inclusion and employee engagement, all of which support the company’s overall objective to deliver industry leading performance. Chevron’s leadership reinforces and monitors the company’s investment in people and the company’s culture. This includes reviews of metrics addressing critical function hiring, leadership development, attrition, diversity and inclusion, and employee engagement.\nThe following table summarizes Chevron’s number of employees by gender, where data is available, and by region as of December 31, 2020.\n1\nIncludes employees where gender data was not collected or employee chose not to disclose gender.\n2\nIncludes 5,108 service station employees; 2,312 and 1,672 new employees came from the 2020 Puma Energy (Australia) Holdings Pty. Ltd and Noble Energy, Inc. acquisitions, respectively.\nHiring, Development and Retention\nThe company’s approach to attracting, developing and retaining its employees is anchored in a career-oriented employment model. Chevron recruits new employees through partnerships with universities and diversity associations. In 2020, over 500 students participated in the company’s first ever virtual internship program. In addition, the company recruits experienced hires to target critical skills.\nDevelopment programs are designed to build leadership capabilities at all levels and ensure the company’s workforce has the technical and operating capabilities to produce energy safely and reliably. Chevron’s leadership regularly reviews metrics on employee training and development programs, which are continually evolving to better meet the needs of the business. For instance, Chevron recently launched learning initiatives focused on digital innovation, including new Digital Academy and Digital Scholars programs. In addition, to ensure business continuity, leadership regularly reviews the talent pipeline, identifies and develops succession candidates, and builds succession plans for leadership positions. The Board provides oversight of CEO and executive succession planning.\nChevron’s 2020 annual voluntary attrition was 4.1 percent, in line with its historical rates. The voluntary attrition rate generally excludes employee departures under enterprise-wide restructuring programs. Chevron believes its low voluntary attrition rate is in part a result of the company’s commitment to employee development and career advancement.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nChevron is committed to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace so that employees are enabled to contribute to their full potential. The company believes innovative solutions to its most complex challenges emerge when diverse people, ideas, and experiences come together in an inclusive environment. Chevron reinforces the value of diversity and inclusion through accountability, communication, training and personnel selection processes. Examples of initiatives to further advance diversity and inclusion include the company’s Neurodiversity program through which the company employs neurodiverse individuals and leverages their talents, its Elevate program which focuses on learning opportunities to promote a deeper understanding of employees in underrepresented groups, and its Returnship initiative which provides support for women re-entering the workforce. In addition, Chevron has twelve employee networks (voluntary groups of employees that come together based on shared identity or interests) and more than fifteen diversity councils across its business units that help align diversity and inclusion efforts with business strategies.\n4\nEmployee Engagement\nEmployee engagement is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment to the company’s values, purpose and strategies. Chevron regularly conducts employee surveys to assess the health of the company’s culture. Recent surveys have indicated a high degree of employee engagement. In 2020, the company’s employee survey focused on the COVID-19 impact on employee well-being and the company’s response to the pandemic. The survey results positively reinforced actions taken by Chevron, and helped inform further actions to address the impact on employees and their families through enhanced mental health and wellness support, financial assistance for unplanned childcare needs and remote learning resources, among other efforts. The company also has long-standing programs such as Ombuds, an independent resource designed to equip employees with options to address and resolve workplace issues; a company hotline, where employees can report concerns to the Corporate Compliance department; and its Employee Assistance Program, a confidential consulting service that can help employees resolve a broad range of personal, family and work-related concerns or problems.\nDescription of Business and Properties\nThe upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects\n*\nin North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2020, and assets as of the end of 2020 and 2019 — for the United States and the company’s international geographic areas — are in\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 74. Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in\nbeginning on page 77 and\non page 82. Refer to page 44 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s capital and exploratory expenditures.\nUpstream\nReserves\nRefer to Table V beginning on page 103 for a tabulation of the company’s proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs), synthetic oil and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2018 and at each year-end from 2018 through 2020. Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations.\nAt December 31, 2020, 27 percent of the company’s net proved oil-equivalent reserves were located in the United States, 18 percent were located in Australia and 20 percent were located in Kazakhstan.\nThe net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2018 through 2020 are shown in the following table:\n1\nOil-equivalent conversion ratio is 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of crude oil\n.\n________________________________________________________\n*\nAs used in this report, the term “project” may describe new upstream development activity, individual phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investments in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of the term “project” as it relates to any specific governmental law or regulation.\n5\nNet Production of Liquids and Natural Gas\nThe following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2020 and 2019 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 3.083 million barrels per day in 2020 was up approximately 1 percent from 2019. Production increases from shale and tight properties and the Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble) acquisition were partially offset by production curtailments associated with OPEC and coordinating countries’ (OPEC+) restrictions and market conditions, and asset sale related decreases of 100,000 barrels per day. Refer to the\nsection beginning on page 37 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the changes in production for crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, synthetic oil and natural gas, and refer to\non pages 107 through 109 for information on annual production by geographical region.\n6\nProduction Outlook\nThe company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2021 will grow up to 3 percent compared to 2020, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $50 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2021 asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, as described beginning on page 33. Refer to the “Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas,” beginning on page 9, for a discussion of the company’s major crude oil and natural gas development projects.\nAverage Sales Prices and Production Costs per Unit of Production\nRefer to\non page 102 for the company’s average sales price per barrel of liquids (including crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids) and per thousand cubic feet of natural gas produced, and the average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nGross and Net Productive Wells\nThe following table summarizes gross and net productive wells at year-end 2020 for the company and its affiliates:\nAcreage\nAt December 31, 2020, the company owned or had under lease or similar agreements undeveloped and developed crude oil and natural gas properties throughout the world. The geographical distribution of the company’s acreage is shown in the following table:\nDelivery Commitments\nThe company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below.\nIn the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 1,136 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2021 through 2023. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity\n7\nproduction from the company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are primarily based on contracts with indexed pricing terms.\nOutside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2,800 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2021 through 2023 from operations in Australia and Israel. The Australia sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that generally reference the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The Israel sales contracts contain formulas that generally reflect an initial base price subject to price indexation, Brent-linked or other, over the life of the contract and have a contractual floor. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries.\nDevelopment Activities\nRefer to Table I on page 99 for details associated with the company’s development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the company’s net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years, and the status of the company’s development wells drilling at December 31, 2020. A “development well” is a well drilled within the known area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.\nExploration Activities\nRefer to Table I on page 99 for detail on the company’s exploration expenditures and costs of unproved property acquisitions for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the company’s net interests in productive and dry exploratory wells completed in each of the last three years, and the number of exploratory wells drilling at December 31, 2020. “Exploratory wells” are wells drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in unknown areas and include delineation and appraisal wells, which are wells drilled to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir.\n8\nReview of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas\nChevron has exploration and production activities in many of the world’s major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron’s 2020 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 37, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in\non page E-7.\nThe discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment.\nUnited States\nUpstream activities in the United States are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico, California, Colorado and the Gulf of Mexico. Acreage for the United States can be found in the table on page 7. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States can be found in the table on page 6.\nWith the acquisition of Noble in October 2020, Chevron increased its position in the Permian Basin and acquired acreage in Colorado and Wyoming.\nThe company’s acreage in the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico includes multiple stacked formations that enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy in the basin, which utilizes multiwell pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. The company is also applying data analytics and technology to drive improvements in identifying well targets, in drilling and completions and in production performance.\nIn 2020, Chevron’s net daily unconventional and conventional production in the Permian Basin averaged 294,000 barrels of crude oil, 980 million cubic feet of natural gas and 150,000 barrels of NGLs.\nIn 2020, Chevron was one of the largest crude oil producers in California. Construction was completed in April 2020 on a new 29-megawatt solar farm to supply power to the Lost Hills Field. In October 2020, Chevron announced participation in a carbon capture trial in California with start-up expected in 2022.\nIn Colorado, development in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin includes Wells Ranch and Mustang areas.

    "text": "Chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risks are not within the company’s control and could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nBUSINESS, OPERATIONAL AND ACQUISITION-RELATED RISK FACTORS\nImpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a significant decrease in demand for Chevron’s products and caused a precipitous drop in commodity prices that has had, and may continue to have, an adverse and potentially material adverse effect on Chevron’s financial and operating results.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the economic, business, and oil and gas industry impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption to capital markets have continued to be far reaching. Crude oil prices, the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations, fell to historic lows, even briefly going negative, due to a combination of a severely reduced demand for crude oil, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, and other refined products resulting from government-mandated travel restrictions and the curtailment of economic activity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, a market imbalance has existed and may continue to exist, with oil supplies exceeding current and expected near-term demand. Although OPEC members and other countries have agreed to cut global oil supply, the commitments and actions to date have not matched the significant decrease in global demand, which has resulted in increased inventory levels in refineries, pipelines and storage facilities in prior periods and which may drive increased inventory levels in future periods.\n18\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil are expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company’s earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs may be negatively affected, as would its production volumes and proved reserves. As a result, the value of the company’s assets may also become impaired in future periods, as we saw in 2020.\nThe company’s operations and workforce are being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, causing certain operations to be curtailed to various degrees. At 50 percent-owned Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan, COVID-19 infections have led to the demobilization of a significant portion of the workforce, adversely impacting the construction pace for completion of the FGP/WPMP project. Although infection levels in Kazakhstan improved in the third quarter 2020, allowing remobilization of the FGP/WPMP construction workforce to commence, a resurgence of infections prevented the final five percent of the planned workforce from returning to work in the fourth quarter 2020, slowing progress on the project. The ultimate effects of COVID-19 on FGP/WPMP construction remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. In particular, we are currently unable to predict whether COVID-19 will have a material adverse impact on our ability to complete FGP/WPMP on schedule or within the current cost estimate for the project.\nAs a result of decreased demand for its products, the company made cuts to its upstream capital and exploratory expenditure program for 2020, which are expected to negatively impact future production, have led to and could lead to further negative revisions of reserves and could also lead to the further impairment of assets. Production curtailments, such as those due to the reductions imposed by OPEC+ nations in Kazakhstan, Nigeria and Angola, and other production curtailment actions taken by operators of assets for which the company has non-operated interests or due to market conditions, have exacerbated and may continue to further exacerbate these negative impacts in future periods. Within downstream, the company reduced its capital spending program and is also deferring certain discretionary maintenance activities while maintaining expenditures for asset integrity and reliability. The company has reduced the utilization rates of its refineries in response to reduced demand for its products, particularly greatly reduced demand for jet fuel due to the COVID-19 impact on travel and the aviation industry.\nThe company’s suppliers are also being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and access to materials, supplies, and contract labor has been strained. In certain cases, the company has received notices invoking force majeure provisions in supplier contracts. This strain on the financial health of the company’s suppliers could put further pressure on the company’s financial results and may negatively impact supply assurance and supplier performance. In-country conditions, including potential future waves of the COVID-19 virus in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates, could impact logistics and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity.\nIn light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, management is currently unable to develop with any level of confidence estimates and assumptions that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period. In addition, the unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in hindsight.\nThere continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial and operating results in future periods. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results, and for what duration and magnitude, depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve, are difficult to predict and, in many instances, are beyond the company's control. Such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any resurgences of the pandemic, and the impact on our workforce and operations; the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy and economic activity, including travel restrictions and prolonged low demand for our products; the ability of our affiliates, suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the actions of OPEC and other countries that otherwise impact supply and demand and correspondingly, commodity prices; the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the pandemic subsides; and Chevron’s ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, and the continuation or a resurgence of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, which in turn could further materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and profitability, including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks.\nChevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices\nChevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude\n19\noil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control (including without limitation due to the COVID-19 pandemic), competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company’s upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depends.\nThe scope of Chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources\nThe company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the company’s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.\nThe company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control\nChevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, other forms of severe weather, wildfires, ambient temperature increases, sea level rise, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.\nChevron’s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.\nCyberattacks targeting Chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business and results of operations\nThere are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron’s cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company’s information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT\n20\nsystems, including the cloud. Additionally, authorized third-party IT systems or software can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to Chevron's IT systems that can materially impact the company’s business. Regardless of the precise method or form, cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations.\nThe company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight\nChevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks.\nThe company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure\nThe company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Noble acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, and the acquisition may disrupt our current plans or operations.\nThe success of the Noble acquisition, which closed in October 2020, will depend, in part, on Chevron’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including the anticipated annual run-rate operating and other cost synergies and accretion to return on capital employed, free cash flow and earnings per share. Failure to realize anticipated synergies in the expected timeframe, operational challenges, the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns, and  unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition may have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nOne of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, Noble Midstream Partners LP, which may involve a potential legal liability.\nOne of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of Noble Midstream, a publicly traded master limited partnership. Our control of the general partner of Noble Midstream may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of duties owed to Noble Midstream, including claims of conflict of interest. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND ESG-RELATED RISK FACTORS\nChevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action\nThe company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action. For example, liability or delays could result from an accidental, unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.\nFor information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page 78.\n21\nPolitical instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevron’s business\nThe company’s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with U.S. sanctions and other trade laws and regulations which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company's operations in certain countries.\nIn addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products, could adversely affect the company’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability.\nLegislation, regulation, and other government actions related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change could continue to increase Chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products\nChevron may be challenged by a further increase in international and domestic legislation, regulation, or other government actions relating to GHG emissions and climate change. Like any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG and climate change-related legislation and regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the company’s oil and gas resources economically infeasible. Although the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) World Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond, if new legislation, regulation, or other government action contributes to a decline in the demand for the company’s products, this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition.\nInternational agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In some jurisdictions, the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and low carbon fuel standard obligations. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as, for example, via a carbon tax (e.g., Singapore and Canada) or via a cap-and-trade program (e.g., Mexico and China). Many governments are providing tax advantages and other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy sources or lower-carbon technologies. The landscape continues to be in a state of constant re-assessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws, regulations, and other actions, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate.\nGHG emissions-related legislation, regulations, and government actions and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbon-based products; make the company’s products more expensive; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources; and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes, revenues, and margins. GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) that could be regulated include, among others, those associated with the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction, and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and related products; and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products. Indirect regulation of GHG emissions could include bans or restrictions on technologies that use the company’s hydrocarbon products. Many of these activities, such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products and substitute products, as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such legislation and regulations, are beyond the company’s control.\n22\nConsideration of climate change-related issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional, or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand, and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate change-related policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the company’s activities in it, and market conditions.\nThe ultimate effect of international agreements; national, regional, and state legislation and regulation; and government actions related to GHG emissions and climate change on the company’s financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and government actions on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business\nIncreasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential consumer and customer use of substitutes to Chevron’s products may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against the company.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Also, some stakeholders, including but not limited to sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment funds, have been promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Unfavorable ESG ratings and investment community divestment initiatives may lead to negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nChanges in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period\nIn preparing the company’s periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the company’s business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.\n23"

Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance. Similarly, impairments or write-offs have occurred, and may occur in the future, as a result of managerial decisions not to progress certain projects in the company’s portfolio.\nWith ongoing global interest in addressing the risks of climate change, support for policies and advancements in lower carbon technologies is expected. In seeking to help advance a lower carbon future, Chevron is focused on lowering its carbon intensity cost efficiently, increasing renewables and offsets in support of its business, and investing in low-carbon technologies to enable commercial solutions.\nResponse to Market Conditions and COVID-19\nDuring most of 2020, travel restrictions and other constraints on economic activity designed to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus were implemented in many locations around the world. These constraints reduced demand for our products, and commodity prices fell, negatively impacting the company’s 2020 financial and operating results. While demand and commodity prices have shown signs of recovery, demand is not back to pre-pandemic levels, and financial results will likely continue to be challenged in future quarters. Due to the rapidly\n31\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nchanging environment, there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability around the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our future results, which could be material.\nChevron entered this crisis well positioned with a strong balance sheet, flexible capital program and low cash flow breakeven price. To protect its long-term health and value, the company took swift action, adjusting the items it can control. The company lowered its capital expenditures 35 percent and lowered its operating expense, excluding non-recurring severance costs, by $1.4 billion compared to 2019. The company completed an enterprise-wide transformation that is expected to capture additional cost efficiencies. Additionally, the company suspended its stock repurchase program in March 2020. Taken together, these actions are consistent with our financial priorities: to protect the dividend, to prioritize capital spend that drives long-term value, and to maintain a strong balance sheet. The company expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity and access to both commercial paper and debt capital markets due to its strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings. Additionally, the company has access to nearly $10 billion in committed credit facilities.\nThe effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods.\nprovides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years.\nRefer to the “Cautionary Statements Relevant to Forward-Looking Information” on page 2 and to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 18 through 23 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nThe company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. The company’s asset sale program for 2018 through 2020 targeted before-tax proceeds of $5-10 billion. For the three year period ending December 31, 2020, assets sales proceeds totaled $7.7 billion, in the middle of the guidance range.\nThe company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.\nComments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:\nUpstream\nEarnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company’s control such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax and other applicable laws and regulations.\nThe company is actively managing its schedule of work, contracting, procurement, and supply chain activities to effectively manage costs and ensure supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of operational goals. Third party costs for capital, exploration, and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to: the general level of inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market based prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, so there may be a lag before the company’s costs reflect the changes in market trends.\nThe spot markets and some of the current cost indexes for many materials and services have stabilized. Crude oil and natural gas prices and demand have rebounded from lows of the early pandemic though demand still has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. Drilling activity in the U.S. has risen slowly but steadily through the end of the year. The timing and\n32\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ntrajectory of any increase in the cost of materials and services going forward will depend on the extent of the oil and gas industry recovery. Correlated with these initial signs of industry recovery and cost stabilization was a noticeable improvement in the risk of default for key suppliers. To date, there have been no material impacts to operations due to supplier defaults. Chevron is actively monitoring and engaging key suppliers to mitigate any potential business impacts.\nCapital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses could also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors.\nThe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $42 per barrel for the full-year 2020, compared to $64 in 2019. As of mid-February 2021, the Brent price was $64 per barrel. The WTI price averaged $39 per barrel for the full-year 2020, compared to $57 in 2019. As of mid-February 2021, the WTI price was $60 per barrel. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark.\nCrude prices sharply declined at the end of the first and into the second quarter 2020 due to surplus supply as demand decreased following government-imposed travel restrictions and other constraints on economic activity. In the second half of 2020, the supply/demand balance slowly improved, primarily due to production cuts and demand growth, allowing prices to somewhat recover. The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2020 was $31 per barrel, down 37 percent from 2019. The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2020 was $36 per barrel, down 38 percent from 2019.\nPrices for natural gas are more closely aligned with seasonal supply-and-demand and infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $1.98 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2020, compared with $2.53 per MCF during 2019. As of mid-February 2021, the Henry Hub spot price increased to $6.00 per MCF amid freezing temperatures across much of the United States.\nOutside the United States, prices for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company’s long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be sold in the Asian spot LNG market. International natural gas realizations averaged $4.59 per MCF during 2020, compared with $5.83 per MCF during 2019. (See page 41 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.)\nThe company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2020 averaged 3.083 million barrels per day. About 14 percent of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2020 occurred in the OPEC-member countries of Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Republic of Congo and Venezuela.\nThe company estimates that net oil-equivalent production in 2021 will grow up to 3 percent compared to 2020, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $50 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2021 asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for crude oil and natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic\n33\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nconditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. The company has increased its investment emphasis on short-cycle projects, but these too are under pressure in the current market environment.\nIn the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in May 2015. In December 2019, the governments of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait signed a memorandum of understanding to allow production to restart in the Partitioned Zone. In mid-February 2020, pre-startup activities commenced, and production resumed in July 2020. The financial effects from the loss of production in 2019 and first half 2020 were not significant. During the fourth quarter 2020, oil equivalent production in the Partitioned Zone averaged 40 thousand barrels per day.\nChevron has interests in Venezuelan crude oil assets, including those operated by Petropiar, Petroboscan and Petroindependiente. While the operating environment in Venezuela has been deteriorating for some time, Petropiar, Petroboscan, and Petroindependiente have conducted activities consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to general licenses issued by the United States government. During the second quarter 2020, the company completed its evaluation of the carrying value of its Venezuelan investments in line with its accounting policies and concluded that given the current operating environment and overall outlook, which created significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the company’s investment, an other than temporary loss of value had occurred, which resulted in a full impairment of its investment in the country totaling $2.6 billion and change in accounting treatment from equity method to non-equity method of accounting. As a result, the company also removed approximately 160 million barrels of proved reserves and stopped reporting production in the country effective July 2020. The company remains committed to its people, assets and operations in Venezuela.\nNet proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 11.1 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end 2020, a decrease of 3 percent from year-end 2019. The reserve replacement ratio in 2020 was 74 percent. The 5 and 10 year reserve replacement ratios were 99 percent and 106 percent, respectively. Refer to\nbeginning on page 103 for a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2018 and each year-end from 2018 through 2020, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2020.\nResponse to Market Conditions and COVID-19: Upstream\nTravel restrictions and other constraints on global economic activity in 2020 in response to COVID-19 caused a significant decrease in demand for oil and gas. This led to lower price realizations across all commodities. While critical asset integrity and reliability activities progressed throughout the year,\n34\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nlocations with high COVID-19 infection rates deferred non-essential work and demobilized non-essential personnel to reduce the COVID-19 exposure risk to our workforce.\nDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, progress continues on the FGP/WPMP project at Tengiz. In the second quarter the project construction workforce was demobilized to 20 percent of planned levels, which slowed the overall construction pace. In the third quarter, the rate of infections in Kazakhstan slowed, allowing remobilization of the FGP/WPMP construction workforce to begin. In the fourth quarter, staffing levels at FGP/WPMP returned to 95 percent of desired fourth quarter remobilization levels, however a worldwide resurgence of infections prevented the remaining 5 percent of the workforce from returning to work and slowed progress on the project. Extended rotations, COVID testing and isolation protocols are in place to minimize the spread of the virus. Given the uncertain timeline for remobilizing all personnel and safely sustaining activity levels, it is too early to provide meaningful information regarding impacts on project cost and schedule.\nFacility maintenance turnarounds are being adjusted and, in certain cases, deferred into 2021. In some cases, turnarounds have been extended in duration and/or reduced in scope in response to the pandemic. As a result of the reduction in capital expenditures, new production is expected to be lower in the near term as drilling and completion activities are scaled back, most notably in the Permian Basin, Gulf of Mexico, and Argentina. Exploration activities and projects not yet in execution phase have been deferred, which may impact production in future years.\nProduction levels were curtailed in 2020 largely because of reductions imposed by OPEC+ nations in Kazakhstan, Nigeria and Angola. In the fourth quarter, OPEC+ curtailments eased slightly relative to the third quarter. Production has also been curtailed due to market conditions, most notably in Thailand. Additionally, operators of assets where the company has non-operated interests also curtailed production. Production curtailments of approximately 106 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day were recorded in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect curtailments to be approximately 40 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, predominately related to OPEC+ restrictions.\nDecreased capital expenditures, lower activity levels, delays in future development timing, and lower commodity prices have resulted in reductions to Chevron’s proved reserve quantities for 2020. For more information on reserves, refer to Table V beginning on page 103.\nAs some countries face a resurgence of the virus, regulatory and in-country conditions could impact logistics and material movement and pose a risk to business continuity. We are taking precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure to and spread of the COVID-19 virus through screening, testing and, when appropriate, quarantining workforce and visitors upon arrival to our operated facilities.\nRefer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages 37 and 38 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.\nDownstream\nEarnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.\nOther factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets and changes in tax laws and regulations.\nThe company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas.\nResponse to Market Conditions and COVID-19: Downstream\nBeginning in March 2020 and continuing into the first  quarter 2021, demand for refined products (primarily jet fuel and motor gasoline) has been below prior year levels as a result of travel restrictions and other constraints on economic activity implemented in many countries to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Product prices also fell sharply, and although economic activity has somewhat rebounded from lows experienced in April, refining margins continued to be at or near historic lows due to lower demand and pressure from\n35\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\na global oil product surplus. Chevron continued to take steps to maximize diesel production, given the decline in jet fuel and motor gasoline demand, to fuel transportation that keeps global supply chains moving. The company is actively monitoring supply and demand dynamics as every region is experiencing different recovery trends. The company is adjusting the schedule for planned maintenance activity across its refining network and idling certain processing units to adjust for lower demand, reduce costs, manage inventories and, most importantly, protect the safety of employees and contractors.\nAs of mid-February 2021, Chevron’s refining crude utilization was approximately 80 to 85 percent and sales were down year-over-year approximately 50 percent for jet fuel, approximately 5 percent for motor gasoline, while diesel sales were relatively flat. It is unclear how long these conditions will persist, but the company will continue to take actions necessary to protect the health and well-being of people, the environment and its operations as conditions evolve. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on page  38 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.\nAll Other\nconsists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.\nOperating Developments\nKey operating developments and other events during 2020 and early 2021 included the following:\nUpstream\nAzerbaijan\nCompleted the sale of the company's interest in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli fields and Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.\nColombia\nCompleted the sale of the company's interest in the offshore Chuchupa and onshore Ballena natural gas fields.\nPhilippines\nCompleted the sale of the company's interest in the Malampaya field in March.\nUnited States\nCompleted the acquisition of Noble Energy, Inc.\nUnited States\nCompleted the sale of the Appalachia natural gas business.\nDownstream\nAustralia\nCompleted the acquisition of Puma Energy (Australia) Holdings Pty Ltd.\nOther\nUnited States\nChevron’s joint venture, CalBioGas LLC, successfully achieved first renewable natural gas production from dairy farms in California and marketed it as an alternative fuel for heavy-duty trucks and buses.\nUnited States\nAnnounced the formation of a joint venture with Brightmark LLC to produce and market renewable natural gas.\nUnited States\nAnnounced an investment in Zap Energy Inc., a start-up company developing a next-generation modular nuclear reactor.\nUnited States\nAnnounced an investment in Blue Planet Systems Corporation, a startup that manufactures and develops carbonate aggregates and carbon capture technology intended to reduce the carbon intensity of industrial operations.\nUnited States\nAnnounced an agreement with Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. seeking to co-develop renewable power projects that will provide electricity to strategic assets across Chevron’s global portfolio. Under the four-year agreement, Chevron plans to generate more than 500 megawatts of its energy demand from renewable sources.\nUnited States\nAnnounced a non-binding offer in February 2021 to acquire the outstanding common units of Noble Midstream Partners LP not already owned by Chevron.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nThe 2020 annual dividend was $5.16 per share, making 2020 the 33rd consecutive year that the company increased its annual per share dividend payout. In January 2021, the company’s Board of Directors declared a  quarterly dividend of $1.29 per share.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nThe company purchased $1.75 billion of its common stock in 2020 under its stock repurchase programs. The stock repurchase program was suspended in March 2020.\n36\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nResults of Operations\nThe following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the company’s business segments – Upstream and Downstream – as well as for “All Other.” Earnings are also presented for the U.S. and international geographic areas of the Upstream and Downstream business segments. Refer to\n, beginning on page 74, for a discussion of the company’s “reportable segments.” This section should also be read in conjunction with the discussion in “Business Environment and Outlook” on pages 31 through 36. Refer to the “Selected Operating Data” table on page 41 for a three-year comparison of production volumes, refined product sales volumes, and refinery inputs. A discussion of variances between 2019 and 2018 can be found in the “Results of Operations” section on pages 33 through 34 of the company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2020.\nU.S. Upstream\nU.S. upstream reported a loss of $1.61 billion in 2020, compared with a loss of $5.09 billion in 2019. The smaller loss was largely due to the absence of fourth quarter 2019 impairment charges of $8.17 billion, primarily associated with Appalachia shale and Big Foot, partially offset by lower crude oil realizations of $3.36 billion and second quarter 2020 impairments and write-offs of $1.20 billion.\nThe company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2020 was $30.53 per barrel compared with $48.54 in 2019. The average natural gas realization was $0.98 per thousand cubic feet in 2020, compared with $1.09 in 2019.\nNet oil-equivalent production in 2020 averaged 1.06 million barrels per day, up 14 percent from 2019. Production increases from shale and tight properties in the Permian Basin and 58,000 barrels per day of production from the Noble  acquisition were partially offset by normal field declines.\nThe net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2020 averaged 790,000 barrels per day, up 9 percent from 2019. Net natural gas production averaged 1.61 billion cubic feet per day in 2020, up 31 percent from 2019.\nInternational Upstream\nInternational upstream reported a loss of $825 million in 2020, compared with earnings of $7.67 billion in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas realizations of $4.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively,\n37\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nhigher charges of $1.4 billion for impairments and write-offs (charges of $3.6 billion in 2020 compared to $2.2 billion in 2019), and lower crude oil sales volumes of $1.1 billion. Lower gains on asset sales of $730 million also contributed to the decrease and were largely offset by lower operating expenses of $710 million. Foreign currency effects had a favorable impact on earnings of $38 million between periods.\nThe company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2020 was $36.07 per barrel compared with $58.14 in 2019. The average natural gas realization was $4.59 per thousand cubic feet in 2020 compared with $5.83 in 2019.\nInternational net oil-equivalent production was 2.03 million barrels per day in 2020, down 5 percent from 2019. The decrease was due to production curtailments associated with OPEC+ restrictions and market conditions, and asset sale related decreases of 94,000 barrels per day, partially offset by higher production entitlement effects and volumes associated with the Noble acquisition.\nThe net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 1.08 million barrels per day in 2020, down 6 percent from 2019. International net natural gas production of 5.68 billion cubic feet per day in 2020 decreased 4 percent from 2019.\nU.S. Downstream\nU.S. downstream reported a loss of $571 million in 2020, compared with earnings of $1.56 billion in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower margins on refined product sales of $1.08 billion and lower sales volumes of $1.00 billion. Lower equity earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem of $220 million also contributed to the decrease. These were partially offset by lower operating expenses of $220 million.\nTotal refined product sales of 1.00 million barrels per day in 2020 were down 20 percent from 2019, mainly due to lower jet fuel, gasoline, and diesel demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInternational Downstream\nInternational downstream earned $618 million in 2020, compared with $922 million in 2019. The decrease in earnings was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales of $160 million, primarily resulting from unfavorable inventory effects. Unfavorable tax items of $110 million also contributed to the decrease. Partially offsetting the decrease in earnings were lower operating expenses of $130 million. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $169 million between periods.\nTotal refined product sales of 1.22 million barrels per day in 2020 were down 8 percent from 2019, mainly due to lower jet fuel demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAll Other\nAll Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.\nNet charges in 2020 increased $1.02 billion from 2019. The change between periods was mainly due to the absence of the second quarter 2019 Anadarko merger termination fee, higher pension expenses, severance and Noble acquisition costs, partially offset by the absence of a prior year tax charge and favorable tax items. Foreign currency effects increased net charges by $210 million between periods.\n38\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nComparative amounts for certain income statement categories are shown below. A discussion of variances between 2019 and 2018 can be found in the “Consolidated Statement of Income” section on pages 34 through 36 of the company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales and other operating revenues decreased in 2020 mainly due to lower refined product, crude oil and natural gas prices, and lower refined product volumes.\nIncome from equity affiliates decreased in 2020 mainly due to the full impairment of Petropiar and Petroboscan in Venezuela and lower upstream-related earnings from Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan.\nRefer to\n, beginning on page 77, for a discussion of Chevron’s investments in affiliated companies.\nOther income decreased in 2020 mainly due to the absence of the receipt of the 2019 Anadarko merger termination fee, lower gains on asset sales and unfavorable swings in foreign currency effects.\nCrude oil and product purchases decreased $29.6 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower crude oil and refined product prices and lower refined product and crude oil volumes.\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.0 billion in 2020. The decrease is primarily due to lower services and fees, expenses for non-operated upstream properties, materials and supplies expense and lower transportation expense, partially offset by higher severance costs.\nExploration expenses in 2020 increased primarily due to higher charges for well write-offs.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower impairments.\nTaxes other than on income increased in 2020 primarily due to higher regulatory expenses and property taxes, partially offset by lower taxes on production, payroll tax and sales and use tax.\nInterest and debt expenses decreased in 2020 mainly due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher debt balances.\nOther components of net periodic benefit costs increased in 2020 primarily due to higher pension settlement costs.\n39\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe decrease in income tax expense in 2020 of $4.58 billion is due to the decrease in total income before tax for the company of $12.99 billion. The decrease in income before taxes for the company is primarily the result of lower crude oil prices partially offset by lower impairments and project write off charges.\nU.S. income before tax decreased from a loss of $5.48 billion in 2019 to a loss of $5.70 billion in 2020. This decrease in earnings before tax was primarily driven by the effect of lower crude oil prices in the U.S. and the absence of the Anadarko merger fee, partially offset by lower impairment charges and higher production. The U.S. tax benefit increased from $1.17 billion in 2019 to $1.58 billion in 2020 primarily due to the increase in before-tax loss.\nInternational income before tax decreased from $11.02 billion in 2019 to a loss of $1.75 billion in 2020. This decrease was primarily driven by the effect of lower crude oil and natural gas prices, lower production, higher impairments and other charges. The lower before-tax income primarily drove the $4.17 billion decrease in international income tax expense, from a charge of $3.86 billion in 2019 to a benefit of $308 million in 2020.\nRefer also to the discussion of the effective income tax rate in\nbeginning on page 79.\n40\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSelected Operating Data\n1,2\n41\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and uses of cash\nThe strength of the company’s balance sheet enabled it to fund any timing differences throughout the year between cash inflows and outflows.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Time Deposits\nTotal balances were $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was $10.6 billion, compared to $27.3 billion in 2019, primarily due to lower crude oil prices. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $1.2 billion in 2020 and $1.4 billion in 2019. Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $2.9 billion in 2020 and $2.8 billion in 2019.\nRestricted cash of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” and “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments, funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges and refundable deposits related to pending asset sales.\nDividends\nDividends paid to common stockholders were $9.7 billion in 2020 and $9.0 billion in 2019.\nDebt and Finance Lease Liabilities\nTotal debt and finance lease liabilities were $44.3 billion at December 31, 2020, up from $27.0 billion at year-end 2019.\nThe $17.3 billion increase in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2020 was primarily due to the company's issuance of long-term public bonds of $8.0 billion in May 2020 and $4.0 billion in August 2020, and the assumption of debt with a fair value of $9.4 billion as part of the transaction to acquire Noble in October 2020. In January 2021, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA) issued bonds, guaranteed by Chevron Corporation, in exchange for the Noble debt. More information on bond issuances is included in\non page 84. These amounts were partially offset by repayment of long-term notes that matured in 2020. The company’s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $11.4 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $13.0 billion at year-end 2019. Of these amounts, $9.825 billion and $9.75 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAt year-end 2020, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2021, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.\nThe company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2023 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued by Chevron Corporation or CUSA.\n42\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation, CUSA, Noble and Texaco Capital Inc. Most of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA- by Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.\nThe company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions, the capital program, lending commitments to affiliates and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company has the flexibility to modify capital spending plans and discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.\nCommitted Credit Facilities\nInformation related to committed credit facilities is included in\n, Short-Term Debt, on page 83.\nSummarized Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries\nIn August 2020, long-term public bonds were issued by CUSA and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Chevron Corporation (together the “Obligor Group”). In March 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a final rule that amended the disclosure requirements with respect to certain guaranteed securities registered or being registered in Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X and adopted new Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X. These amendments were effective January 4, 2021. Accordingly, as disclosed in the tables below, summary financial information is presented for Chevron Corporation, as Guarantor, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries, and CUSA, as the issuer, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries. The summary financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis and transactions between the combined entities have been eliminated. Financial information for non-guarantor entities has been excluded.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nOn February 1, 2019, the company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $25 billion and no set term limits. As of December 31, 2020, the company had purchased a total of 48.6 million shares for $5.5 billion, resulting in $19.5 billion remaining under the program authorized in February 2019. On March 24, 2020, the company announced the suspension of the stock repurchase program in response to depressed market conditions following the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. No shares were purchased under the program after this announcement.\nRepurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company’s shares, general market and economic\n43\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nconditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nCapital and Exploratory Expenditures\nCapital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\nTotal reported expenditures for 2020 were $13.5 billion, including $4.0 billion for the company’s share of equity-affiliate expenditures, which did not require cash outlays by the company. The acquisition of Noble is not included in the company’s capital and exploratory expenditures. For more information on the Noble acquisition, see page 96 in\n. In 2019, expenditures were $21.0 billion, including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $6.1 billion.\nOf the $13.5 billion of expenditures in 2020, 81 percent, or $10.9 billion, related to upstream activities. Approximately 85 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2019. International upstream accounted for 53 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2020 and 54 percent in 2019.\nThe company estimates that 2021 organic capital and exploratory expenditures will be $14 billion, including $4.2 billion of spending by affiliates. This is in line with 2020 expenditures, and reflects a robust portfolio of upstream and downstream investments, highlighted by the FGP/WPMP project at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan and the company’s Permian Basin position. In the upstream business, approximately $6.5 billion is allocated to currently producing assets, including about $2.0 billion for Permian unconventional development. Approximately $3.5 billion of the upstream program is planned for major capital projects underway, of which about 75 percent is associated with FGP/WPMP at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. Additionally, $1.5 billion is allocated to exploration, early stage development projects, and midstream activities. The company monitors crude oil market conditions and is able to adjust future capital outlays should oil price conditions deteriorate.\nWorldwide downstream spending in 2021 is estimated to be $2.1 billion, with $1.2 billion estimated for projects in the United States.\nInvestments in technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2021 are budgeted at $0.4 billion.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nThe company had noncontrolling interests of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $24 million and $18 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included within noncontrolling interests for 2020 is $120 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest associated with Noble Midstream.\nPension Obligations\nInformation related to pension plan contributions is included beginning on page 87 in\n, Employee Benefit Plans, under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.”\n44\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFinancial Ratios and Metrics\nThe following represent several metrics the company believes are useful measures to monitor the financial health of the company and its performance over time:\nCurrent Ratio\nCurrent assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2020, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $2.7 billion.\nInterest Coverage Ratio\nIncome before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company’s interest coverage ratio in 2020 was lower than 2019 due to lower income.\nFree Cash Flow\nThe cash provided by operating activities less cash capital expenditures, which represents the cash available to creditors and investors after investing in the business.\nDebt Ratio\nTotal debt as a percentage of total debt plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders’ Equity, which indicates the company’s leverage. The company’s debt ratio was 25.2 percent at year-end 2020, compared with 15.8 percent at year-end 2019.\n45\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNet Debt Ratio\nTotal debt less cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, and marketable securities as a percentage of total debt less cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, and marketable securities, plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders’ Equity, which indicates the company’s leverage, net of its cash balances.\nCapital Employed\nThe sum of Chevron Corporation Stockholders’ Equity, total debt and noncontrolling interests, which represents the net investment in the business.\nReturn on Average Capital Employed (ROCE)\nNet income attributable to Chevron (adjusted for after-tax interest expense and noncontrolling interest) divided by average capital employed. Average capital employed is computed by averaging the sum of capital employed at the beginning and end of the year. ROCE is a ratio intended to measure annual earnings as a percentage of historical investments in the business.\nReturn on Stockholders\n’\nEquity (ROSE)\nNet income attributable to Chevron divided by average Chevron Corporation Stockholders’ Equity. Average stockholder’s equity is computed by averaging the sum of stockholder’s equity at the beginning and end of the year. ROSE is a ratio intended to measure earnings as a percentage of shareholder investments.\n46\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Guarantees and Other Contingencies\nLong-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements\nInformation related to these matters is included on page 92 in\n, Other Contingencies and Commitments.\nThe following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations:\n1.\nExcludes contributions for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans and ARO. Information on employee benefit plans is contained in\nbeginning on page 87. Information on ARO's is contained in\nbeginning on page 94\n2.\nDoes not include amounts related to the company’s income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. The company is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods in which such liabilities may become payable. The company does not expect settlement of such liabilities to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity in any single period.\n3.\n$9.825 billion of short-term debt that the company expects to refinance is included in long-term debt. The repayment schedule above reflects the projected repayment of the entire amounts in the 2022–2023 period. The amounts represent only the principal balance.\n4.\nExcludes finance lease liabilities.\n5.\nDoes not include commodity purchase obligations that are not fixed or determinable. These obligations are generally monetized in a relatively short period of time through sales transactions or similar agreements with third parties. Examples include obligations to purchase LNG, regasified natural gas and refinery products at indexed prices.\nDirect Guarantees\nAdditional information related to guarantees is included on page 92  in\n, Other Contingencies and Commitments.\nIndemnifications\nInformation related to indemnifications is included on page 92  in\n, Other Contingencies and Commitments.\nFinancial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk\nThe market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.\nDerivative Commodity Instruments\nChevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2020.\nThe company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies. The company’s risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors.\nDerivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2020 was not material to the company’s results of operations.\n47\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value, at the 95 percent confidence level with a one-day holding period, from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company’s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was not material to the company’s cash flows or results of operations.\nForeign Currency\nThe company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no material open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2020.\nInterest Rates\nThe company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2020, the company had no interest rate swaps.\nTransactions With Related Parties\nChevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to “Other Information” on page 77, in\n, Investments and Advances, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.\nLitigation and Other Contingencies\nMTBE\nInformation related to methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) matters is included on page 78 in\nunder the heading “MTBE.”\nEcuador\nInformation related to Ecuador matters is included in\nunder the heading “Ecuador,” beginning on page 78.\nEnvironmental\nThe following table displays the annual changes to the company’s before-tax environmental remediation reserves, including those for U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws.\nThe company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately $13.6 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2020 related primarily to upstream properties.\nFor the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise decommission the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation.\nRefer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company’s 2020 environmental expenditures. Refer to\non page 93 for additional discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to\non page 94 for additional discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations.\nSuspended Wells\nInformation related to suspended wells is included in\n, Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells, beginning on page 85.\nIncome Taxes\nInformation related to income tax contingencies is included on pages 79 through 82  in\nand page 92 in\nunder the heading “Income Taxes.”\n48\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOther Contingencies\nInformation related to other contingencies is included on page 93 in\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading “Other Contingencies.”\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe company is subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. For example, international agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the national, state and local levels. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 18 through 23 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nMost of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials; or comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity or financial position.\nAccidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards.\nUsing definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2020 at approximately $2.0 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $0.5 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.5 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the decommissioning and restoration of sites.\nFor 2021, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.5 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\nManagement makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.\nThe discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein:\n49\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n1.\nthe nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and\n2.\nthe impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is material.\nThe development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows:\nOil and Gas Reserves\nCrude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs.\nThe estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:\n1.\nAmortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During 2020, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) for oil and gas properties was $13.0 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2020 were 6.4 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD&A in 2020 would have increased by approximately $700 million.\n2.\nImpairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see\nImpairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates\nbelow.\nRefer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity Information,” beginning on page 103, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ended December 31, 2020, and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves” on page 111 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020.\nThis Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of\n, beginning on page 64, which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities.\nImpairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates\nThe company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\nDetermination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in\non page 82 and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in\n, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” beginning on page 64.\n50\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company’s crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets’ associated carrying values.\nInvestments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.\nIn 2020, the company recorded impairments and write-offs for certain oil and gas properties primarily due to downward revisions to its oil and gas price outlook. In addition, the company fully impaired its investments in Petropiar and Petroboscan after completing an evaluation of the carrying value of its Venezuelan investments in line with its accounting policies and concluding that given the current operating environment and overall outlook, which create significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the company’s investment, an other than temporary loss of value had occurred.\nIn 2019, the company recorded impairments and write-offs for certain oil and gas properties following the review and approval of its business plan and capital expenditure program.  As a result of the company’s disciplined approach to capital allocation and a downward revision in its longer-term commodity price outlook, the company reduced funding to various natural gas-related upstream opportunities including Appalachia shale, Kitimat LNG and other international projects. In addition, the revised long-term oil price outlook resulted in an impairment of Big Foot.\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nIn the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2020 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to\non page 94 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\n, beginning on page 87, includes information on the funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.\nThe determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included on page 89 in\nunder the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company’s control.\n51\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFor 2020, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.5 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 3.3 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 2.6 percent for the primary U.S. pension plan. The actual return for 2020 was 9.4 percent. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2020, actual asset returns averaged 7.9 percent for this plan. Additionally, with the exception of three years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 6.5 percent during each year.\nTotal pension expense for 2020 was $1.5 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 67 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2020 by approximately $88 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2020 by approximately $269 million.\nThe aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2020, was a net liability of approximately $6.2 billion. An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2020, the company used a discount rate of 2.4 percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 61 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $475 million, and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately $3.2 billion to $2.8 billion.\nFor the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2020 was $57 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2020, was $2.7 billion. For the primary U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 3.4 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 2.7 percent to measure expense in 2020, and a 2.4 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31, 2020. Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on 2020 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2020.\nDifferences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 88 in\nfor more information on the $7.4 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2020,  In addition, information related to company contributions is included on page 91 in\nunder the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.”\nBusiness Combinations – Purchase-Price Allocation\nAccounting for business combinations requires the allocation of the company’s purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their respective fair values. The company uses all available information to make these fair value determinations. Determining the fair values of assets acquired generally involves assumptions regarding the amounts and timing of future revenues and expenditures, as well as discount rates. For additional discussion of purchase price allocations, refer to\nbeginning on page 96\n.\nContingent Losses\nManagement also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology.\nUnder the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to\nbeginning on page 92. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2020.\nAn estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. For further information, refer to “Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material\n52\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nimpact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period” in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on page 23.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRefer to\nbeginning on page 69 for information regarding new accounting standards.\n53\nQuarterly Results\nUnaudited\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\n59\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nMillions of dollars\n60\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\n61\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nMillions of dollars\n62\nConsolidated Statement of Equity\nAmounts in millions of dollars\n63\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 1\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.\nSubsidiary and Affiliated Companies\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method.\nInvestments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.\nDifferences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nOwnership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Equity. Included within noncontrolling interest is redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\nDerivatives\nThe majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company’s commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet.\nInventories\nCrude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials, supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable value.\n64\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nProperties, Plant and Equipment\nThe successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to\n, beginning on page 85, for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.\nLong-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties, the company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense.\nLong-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to\n, beginning on page 71, relating to fair value measurements. The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to\n, on page 94, relating to AROs.\nDepreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.\nThe capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize finance lease right-of-use assets.\nGains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as “Other income.”\nExpenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.\nLeases\nLeases are classified as operating or finance leases. Both operating and finance leases recognize lease liabilities and associated right-of-use assets. The company has elected the short-term lease exception and therefore only recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year. The company has elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant non-lease (i.e., service) components.\nWhere leases are used in joint ventures, the company recognizes\n100\npercent of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when the company is the sole signatory for the lease (in most cases, where the company is the operator of a joint venture). Lease costs reflect only the costs associated with the operator’s working interest share. The lease term includes the committed lease term identified in the contract, taking into account renewal and termination options that management is\n65\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nreasonably certain to exercise. The company uses its incremental borrowing rate as a proxy for the discount rate based on the term of the lease unless the implicit rate is available.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nEnvironmental Expenditures\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.\nLiabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to\n, on page 94, for a discussion of the company’s AROs.\nFor federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.\nCurrency Translation\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the Consolidated Statement of Equity.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical products as a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer.\nPayment is generally due within 30 days of delivery.\nThe company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost, not a separate performance obligation, and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized.\nRevenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer. The company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include discounts and allowances. Until market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts, the transaction price included in revenue is based on the company’s estimate of the most likely outcome.\nDiscounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain multiple products, an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product. The company includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods.\nStock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation\nThe company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. The company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights, which have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. In addition, performance shares granted under the company’s LTIP will vest at the end of the\nthree\n-year performance period. For awards granted under the company’s LTIP beginning in 2017, stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each award vests annually on each January 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Standard restricted stock unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award will vest on January 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria. The company amortizes these awards on a straight-line basis.\n66\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 2\nChanges in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses\nThe change in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses (AOCL) presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the impact of significant amounts reclassified from AOCL on information presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2020, are reflected in the table below.\n1\nAll amounts are net of tax.\n2\nRefer to\nbeginning on page 87, for reclassified components totaling $\n1,084\nthat are included in employee benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. Related income taxes for the same period, totaling $\n252\n, are reflected in Income Tax Expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. All other reclassified amounts were insignificant.\n3\nStranded tax reclassification to retained earnings per ASU 2018-02.\n67\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 3\nInformation Relating to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nThe “Other” line in the Operating Activities section includes changes in postretirement benefits obligations and other long-term liabilities.\nThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes changes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet that did not affect cash. \"Distributions more (less) than income from equity affiliates,\" “Depreciation, depletion and amortization,” “Deferred income tax provision,” “Dry hole expense,” and \"Net decrease (increase) in operating working capital\" collectively include approximately $\n4.8\nbillion in non-cash reductions in 2020 relating to impairments and other non-cash charges. “Depreciation, depletion and amortization,” “Deferred income tax provision,” and “Dry hole expense” collectively include approximately $\n9.3\nbillion in non-cash reductions recorded in 2019 relating to impairments and other non-cash charges.\nRefer also to\n, on page 94, for a discussion of revisions to the company’s AROs that also did not involve cash receipts or payments for the three years ending December 31, 2020.\n68\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nRefer also to\non page 96 for a discussion of the all-stock acquisition of Noble. The cash received as a result of the acquisition is reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as “Cash acquired from Noble Energy, Inc.” Other changes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet resulting from the acquisition that did not affect cash are not reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe major components of “Capital expenditures” and the reconciliation of this amount to the reported capital and exploratory expenditures, including equity affiliates, are presented in the following table.\n*\nExcludes non-cash movements of $\n816\nin 2020, $(\n239\n) in 2019 and $\n25\nin 2018.\nThe table below quantifies the beginning and ending balances of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet:\nNote 4\nNew Accounting Standards\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)\nEffective January 1, 2020, Chevron adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13 and its related amendments. For additional information on the company’s expected credit losses, refer to\non page 96.\nNote 5\nLease Commitments\nThe company enters into leasing arrangements as a lessee; any lessor arrangements are not significant. Operating lease arrangements mainly involve land, bareboat charters, terminals, drill ships, drilling rigs, time chartered vessels, office buildings and warehouses, and exploration and production equipment. Finance leases primarily include facilities, vessels, office buildings, and production equipment.\nDetails of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases, including the balance sheet presentation, are as follows:\n69\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\n1\nIncludes non-cash additions of $\n1,353\nand $\n164\nin 2020, and $\n1,201\nand $\n184\nin 2019 for right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new and modified lease liabilities for operating and finance leases, respectively. 2020 includes $\n566\nin operating lease right-of-use assets and $\n566\nlease liabilities associated with the Puma acquisition. 2020 also includes $\n124\nin operating lease right-of-use assets and $\n148\nlease liabilities, and $\n112\nin finance lease right-of-use assets and $\n309\nlease liabilities associated with the Noble acquisition.\nTotal lease costs consist of both amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income during the period and amounts capitalized as part of the cost of another asset. Total lease costs incurred for operating and finance leases were as follows:\n1\nNet rental expense of $\n816\nfor 2018.\n2\nIncludes variable and short-term lease costs.\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities was as follows:\nAt December 31, 2020, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for operating and finance leases were as follows:\nAdditionally, the company has $\n907\nin future undiscounted cash flows for operating leases not yet commenced. These leases are primarily for a drill ship and drilling rigs. For those leasing arrangements where the underlying asset is not yet constructed, the lessor is primarily involved in the design and construction of the asset.\n70\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 6\nSummarized Financial Data – Chevron U.S.A. Inc.\nChevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA) is a major subsidiary of Chevron Corporation. CUSA and its subsidiaries manage and operate most of Chevron’s U.S. businesses. Assets include those related to the exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and those associated with the refining, marketing, supply and distribution of products derived from petroleum, excluding most of the regulated pipeline operations of Chevron. CUSA also holds the company’s investment in the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC joint venture, which is accounted for using the equity method.\nThe summarized financial information for CUSA and its consolidated subsidiaries is as follows:\nNote 7\nFair Value Measurements\nThe tables on the next page show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nMarketable Securities\nThe company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2020.\nDerivatives\nThe company records its derivative instruments – other than any commodity derivative contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale – on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information.\nProperties, Plant and Equipment\nThe company reported impairments for certain upstream properties during 2020 primarily due to downward revisions to its oil and gas price outlook. The impact of these impairments is included in “Depreciation, depletion and amortization” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company reported impairments for certain upstream properties in 2019 primarily due to capital allocation decisions and a lower long-term commodity price outlook.\nInvestments and Advances\nIn 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in Petropiar and Petroboscan in Venezuela. The impact of these impairments is included in “Income (loss) from equity affiliates” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company reported impairments for certain upstream equity companies in 2019 primarily due to capital allocation decisions and lower long-term commodity price outlook.\n71\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nAt year-end 2020, the company had assets measured at fair value Level 3 using unobservable inputs of $\n2,451\n. The carrying value of these assets were written down to fair value based on estimates derived from internal discounted cash flow models. Cash flows were determined using estimates of future production, an outlook of future price based on published prices and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. The significant Level 3 inputs were attributed to two assets, one in an international location where volumes and price were primarily based on natural gas, and the second was in a U.S. location where volumes and price were primarily based on crude.\nAssets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value\nThe company holds cash equivalents and time deposits in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of\n90\ndays or less and money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $\n5,596\nand $\n5,686\nat December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and bank time deposits are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31, 2020.\n“Cash and cash equivalents” do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $\n1,141\nand $\n1,225\nat December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds related to certain upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments and a financing program, which are reported in “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term debt, excluding finance lease liabilities, of $\n30,805\nand $\n13,659\nat December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, had estimated fair values of $\n34,390\nand $\n14,326\n, respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. The fair value of corporate bonds is $\n32,123\nand classified as Level 1. The fair value of other long-term debt is $\n2,267\nand classified as Level 2.\nThe carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were not material.\nNote 8\nFinancial and Derivative Instruments\nDerivative Commodity Instruments\nThe company’s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. None of the company’s derivative instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the company’s affiliates make such designation. The company’s derivatives are not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities.\n72\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nThe company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets, which are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required.\nDerivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, and their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are below:\nConsolidated Balance Sheet: Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nConsolidated Statement of Income: The Effect of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nThe table below represents gross and net derivative assets and liabilities subject to netting agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet: The Effect of Netting Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nDerivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for “a right of offset.”\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company’s short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company investment policies limit the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s counterparties in derivative instruments.\nThe trade receivable balances, reflecting the company’s diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed among the company’s broad customer base worldwide. As a result, the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral instruments to support sales to customers.\n73\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 9\nAssets Held for Sale\nAt December 31, 2020, the company classified $\n1,101\nof net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held for sale” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are associated with upstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in the next 12 months. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2020 were not material.\nNote 10\nEquity\nRetained earnings at December 31, 2020 and 2019, included $\n26,532\nand $\n25,319\n, respectively, for the company’s share of undistributed earnings of equity affiliates.\nAt December 31, 2020, about\n67\nmillion shares of Chevron’s common stock remained available for issuance from the\n260\nmillion shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan. In addition,\n644,376\nshares remain available for issuance from the\n1,600,000\nshares of the company’s common stock that were reserved for awards under the Chevron Corporation Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan.\nNote 11\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon “Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation” (“earnings”) and includes the effects of deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in Chevron stock units by certain officers and employees of the company. Diluted EPS includes the effects of these items as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options awarded under the company’s stock option programs (refer to\n, “Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation,” beginning on page 86).\nThe table below sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS:\nNote 12\nOperating Segments and Geographic Data\nAlthough each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into\ntwo\nbusiness segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments.” Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products and lubricants; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\n74\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nThe company’s segments are managed by “segment managers” who report to the “chief operating decision maker” (CODM). The segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.\nThe company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the company’s operations are reported as “International” (outside the United States).\nSegment Earnings\nThe company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. Non billable costs remain at the corporate level in “All Other.”\nEarnings by major operating area are presented in the following table:\nSegment Assets\nSegment assets do not include intercompany investments or receivables.\nAssets at year-end 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues\nOperating segment sales and other operating revenues, including internal transfers, for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018, are presented in the table on the next page. Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices.\n75\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nRevenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. “All Other” activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.\n1\nOther than the United States, no other country accounted for 10 percent or more of the company’s Sales and Other Operating Revenues.\nSegment Income Taxes\nSegment income tax expense for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\nOther Segment Information\nAdditional information for the segmentation of major equity affiliates is contained in\n, on page 77. Information related to properties, plant and equipment by segment is contained in\n, on page 82.\n76\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 13\nInvestments and Advances\nEquity in earnings, together with investments in and advances to companies accounted for using the equity method and other investments accounted for at or below cost, is shown in the following table. For certain equity affiliates, Chevron pays its share of some income taxes directly. For such affiliates, the equity in earnings does not include these taxes, which are reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income as “Income tax expense.”\nDescriptions of major affiliates and non-equity investments, including significant differences between the company’s carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows:\nTengizchevroil\nChevron has a\n50\npercent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan. At December 31, 2020, the company’s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $\n100\nhigher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO’s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO’s net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project with a balance of $\n4,825\n.\nPetropiar\nChevron has a\n30\npercent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment. At December 31, 2020, the underlying equity in Petropiar’s net assets was approximately $\n1,500\n.\nPetroboscan\nChevron has a\n39.2\npercent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company which operates the Boscan Field in Venezuela. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petroboscan affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment. At December 31, 2020, the underlying equity in Petroboscan’s net assets was approximately $\n1,100\n. The company also has an outstanding long-term loan to Petroboscan of $\n560\nat year-end 2020.\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium\nChevron has a\n15\npercent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\nAngola LNG Limited\nChevron has a\n36.4\npercent interest in Angola LNG Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\nNoble Midstream Equity Affiliates\nNoble Midstream, a fully consolidated subsidiary of Chevron, has equity investments in entities which operate midstream assets in the United States. At December 31, 2020, equity investments included\n77\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nAdvantage Pipeline LLC (\n50\npercent), Delaware Crossing LLC (\n50\npercent), EPIC Crude Holdings (\n30\npercent), EPIC Y-Grade (\n15\npercent), EPIC Propane (\n15\npercent), and Saddlehorn Pipeline Company, LLC (\n20\npercent).\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC\nChevron owns\n50\npercent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by Phillips 66.\nGS Caltex Corporation\nChevron owns\n50\npercent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea. The joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants.\nOther Information\n“Sales and other operating revenues” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes $\n6,038\n, $\n8,006\nand $\n10,378\nwith affiliated companies for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. “Purchased crude oil and products” includes $\n3,003\n, $\n5,694\nand $\n6,598\nwith affiliated companies for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n“Accounts and notes receivable” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $\n807\nand $\n810\ndue from affiliated companies at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. “Accounts payable” includes $\n244\nand $\n506\ndue to affiliated companies at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table provides summarized financial information on a\n100\npercent basis for all equity affiliates as well as Chevron’s total share, which includes Chevron’s net loans to affiliates of $\n5,153\n, $\n4,331\nand $\n3,402\nat December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNote 14\nLitigation\nMTBE\nChevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to\nsix\npending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. The company’s ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States.\nEcuador\nTexaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of an oil production consortium with Ecuadorian state-owned Petroecuador from 1967 until 1992. After termination of the consortium and a third-party environmental audit, Ecuador and the consortium parties entered into a settlement agreement specifying Texpet’s  remediation obligations. Following Texpet’s completion of a\nthree\n-year remediation program, Ecuador certified the remediation as proper and released Texpet and its affiliates from environmental liability. In May 2003, plaintiffs alleging environmental harm from the consortium’s activities sued Chevron in the Superior Court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. In February 2011, that court entered a judgment against Chevron for approximately $\n9,500\nplus additional punitive damages. An appellate panel affirmed, and Ecuador’s National Court of Justice ratified the judgment but nullified the punitive damages, resulting in a judgment of approximately $\n9,500\n. Ecuador’s highest Constitutional Court rejected Chevron’s final appeal in July 2018.\nIn February 2011, Chevron sued the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and supporters in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and state law. The SDNY court ruled that the Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption, and prohibited the RICO defendants from seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in the United States or profiting from their illegal acts. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in June 2017, rendering final the U.S. judgment in favor of Chevron. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs sought to\n78\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nhave the Ecuadorian judgment recognized and enforced in Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. All of those recognition and enforcement actions were dismissed and resolved in Chevron’s favor. Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim against Ecuador in September 2009 before an arbitral tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. In August 2018, the Tribunal issued an award holding that the Ecuadorian judgment was based on environmental claims that Ecuador had settled and released, and that it was procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption. According to the Tribunal, the Ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other States.” The Tribunal ordered Ecuador to remove the status of enforceability from the Ecuadorian judgment and to compensate Chevron for any injuries resulting from the judgment. The third and final phase of the arbitration, to determine the amount of compensation Ecuador owes to Chevron, is ongoing. In September 2020, the District Court of The Hague denied Ecuador’s request to set aside the Tribunal’s award, stating that it now is “common ground” between Ecuador and Chevron that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent. In December 2020, Ecuador appealed the District Court’s decision to The Hague Court of Appeals. In a separate proceeding, Ecuador also admitted that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent in a public filing with the Office of the United States Trade Representative in July 2020.\nManagement’s Assessment\nThe ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron, remains uncertain. Chevron continues to believe that the Ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable and that it does not provide any basis upon which an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or range of loss can be made.\nNote 15\nTaxes\nThe reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and the company’s effective income tax rate is detailed in the following table:\n*\nIncludes one-time tax costs (benefits) associated with changes in uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances.\nThe 2020 decrease in income tax expense of $\n4,583\nis a result of the year-over-year decrease in total income before income tax expense, which is primarily due to lower crude oil prices in 2020, partially offset by lower impairment and write off\n79\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\ncharges. The company’s effective tax rate changed from\n49\npercent in 2019 to\n25\npercent in 2020. The change in effective tax rate is a consequence of mix effect resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions.\nThe company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis.\nThe reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following:\nDeferred tax liabilities decreased by $\n403\nfrom year-end 2019. The decrease to Properties, plant and equipment temporary differences was partially offset with an increase to Investments and other. The Properties, plant and equipment decrease was primarily due to upstream impairments. Deferred tax assets increased by $\n3,621\nfrom year-end 2019. This increase was primarily related to increases in tax loss carryforwards for various locations, miscellaneous items related to foreign exchange and foreign tax credits acquired with the purchase of Noble.\nThe overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. The valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management’s assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2020, the company had gross tax loss carryforwards of approximately $\n19,763\nand tax credit carryforwards of approximately $\n1,056\n, primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2021 through 2034. U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $\n10,585\nwill expire between 2021 and 2030.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:\nIncome taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for U.S. state and foreign withholding tax purposes.\nU.S. state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately $\n52,100\nat December 31, 2020. This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.\n80\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nUncertain Income Tax Positions\nThe company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods.\nThe following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included.\nApproximately\n83\npercent of the $\n5,018\nof unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020, would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition.\nTax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2020. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States – 2013, Nigeria – 2007, Australia – 2009 and Kazakhstan – 2012.\nThe company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.\nOn the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “Income tax expense.” As of December 31, 2020, accrual benefit of $(\n95\n) for anticipated interest and penalty were included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accrual charges of $\n30\nas of year-end 2019. Income tax expense (benefit) associated with interest and penalties was $(\n124\n), $(\n3\n) and $\n8\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n81\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 16\nProperties, Plant and Equipment\n1\n1\nOther than the United States and Australia, no other country accounted for 10 percent or more of the company’s net properties, plant and equipment (PP&E) in 2020. Australia had PP&E of  $\n48,060\n, $\n51,359\nand $\n53,768\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Gross Investment at Cost, Net Investment and Additions at Cost for 2020 each include $\n16,703\nassociated with the Noble acquisition.\n2\nNet of dry hole expense related to prior years’ expenditures of $\n709\n, $\n49\nand $\n343\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n3\nDepreciation expense includes accretion expense of $\n560\n, $\n628\nand $\n654\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and impairments of $\n2,792\n, $\n10,797\nand $\n735\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n82\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 17\nShort-Term Debt\nRedeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date.\nThe company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2020, the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt.\nAt December 31, 2020, the company had $\n9,825\nin\n364\n-day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities allow the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year. This supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facility would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating.\nNo\nborrowings were outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2020.\nThe company classified $\n9,825\nand $\n9,750\nof short-term debt as long-term at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.\n83\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 18\nLong-Term Debt\nTotal long-term debt including finance lease liabilities at December 31, 2020, was $42,767.\nThe company’s long-term debt outstanding at year-end 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\nChevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2023. This registration statement is for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by Chevron Corporation or CUSA.\nLong-term debt excluding finance lease liabilities with a principal balance of $\n33,507\nmatures as follows: 2021 – $\n2,600\n; 2022 – $\n5,548\n; 2023 – $\n6,475\n; 2024 – $\n1,650\n; 2025 – $\n4,000\n; and after 2025 – $\n13,234\n.\nThe company completed bond issuances of $\n8,000\nand $\n4,000\nin May and August 2020, respectively. Chevron also assumed total debt, including finance lease obligations, with a fair value of approximately $\n9,400\n, associated with the acquisition of Noble on October 5, 2020.\nIncluded in the debt assumed from Noble were senior notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $\n5,800\n, with interest rates ranging from\n3.250\npercent to\n8.000\npercent and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2049. On January 6, 2021, Chevron announced that the aggregate principal amount of $\n5,697\nof prior Noble senior notes were exchanged for new\n84\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nsenior notes issued by CUSA, guaranteed by Chevron, and having the same interest rates and maturity dates as the Noble senior notes. The aggregate principal amount of $\n5,697\nprior Noble notes were validly tendered and accepted and subsequently terminated. Following such termination, $\n103\naggregate principal amount remains outstanding across ten series of senior notes issued by Noble, for which Chevron provided no guarantee, and the indentures were modified to eliminate any financial reporting or credit rating requirements. In February 2021, the indenture governing Noble’s\n7.250\npercent senior debentures due 2097 was modified to provide a guarantee by Chevron and eliminate any financial reporting or credit rating requirements.\nSee\n, beginning on page 71, for information concerning the fair value of the company’s long-term debt.\nNote 19\nAccounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells\nThe company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense.\nThe following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended December 31, 2020:\n*\n2020 represents fair value of well costs acquired in the Noble acquisition. 2019 represents property sales.\nThe following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling. The aging of the former Noble wells is based on the date the drilling was completed, rather than Chevron’s October 2020 acquisition of Noble.\n*\nCertain projects have multiple wells or fields or both.\nOf the $\n2,486\nof exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2020, $\n1,197\nis related to\n7\nprojects that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future. The $\n1,289\nbalance is related to\n10\nprojects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development.\nThe projects for the $\n1,289\nreferenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability: (a) $\n826\n(\nseven\nprojects) – undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected within\nfour years\n; (b) $\n463\n(\nthree\nprojects) – development alternatives under review. While progress was being made on all\n17\nprojects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the projects. More than half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next\nfive years\n.\n85\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nThe $\n2,486\nof suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2020, represents\n89\nexploratory wells in\n17\nprojects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis:\nNote 20\nStock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for stock options for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n94\n($\n74\nafter tax), $\n81\n($\n64\nafter tax) and $\n105\n($\n83\nafter tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and restricted stock units was $\n96\n($\n76\nafter tax), $\n313\n($\n266\nafter tax) and $\n60\n($\n47\nafter tax) for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at December 31, 2020, or December 31, 2019.\nCash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n226\n, $\n1,090\nand $\n1,159\n, respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were $\n8\n, $\n43\nand $\n43\nfor 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCash paid to settle performance shares, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights was $\n95\n, $\n119\nand $\n157\nfor 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Cash paid in 2020 included $\n11\nmillion for Noble awards paid under change-in-control plan provisions.\nAwards under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through May 2023, no more than\n260\nmillion shares may be issued under the LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 29, 2013, no more than\n50\nmillion of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards issued before January 1, 2017, the contractual terms vary between\nthree years\nfor the performance shares and restricted stock units, and\n10\nyears for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. For awards issued after January 1, 2017, contractual terms vary between\nthree years\nfor the performance shares and special restricted stock units,\nfive years\nfor standard restricted stock units and\n10\nyears for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. Forfeitures for performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are recognized as they occur. Forfeitures for stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990.\nNoble Share-Based Plans (Noble Plans)\nOn the closing of the acquisition of Noble in October 2020, outstanding stock options granted under various Noble Plans were exchanged for fully vested Chevron options at a conversion rate of\n0.1191\nChevron shares for each Noble share. These awards retained the same provision as the original Noble Plans. Awards issued may be exercised for up to\n5\nyears after termination of employment, depending upon the termination type, or the original expiration date, whichever is earlier. Other awards issued under the Noble Plans included restricted stock, phantom stock units, and performance shares that retained the same provisions as the original Noble Plans. Upon termination of employment due to change-in-control, all unvested awards issued under the Noble Plans, including stock options, restricted stock, phantom stock units and performance shares become vested on the termination date.\nFair Value and Assumptions\nThe fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions:\n86\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\n1\nExpected term is based on historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation data.\n2\nVolatility rate is based on historical stock prices over an appropriate period, generally equal to the expected term.\nA summary of option activity, including Noble, during 2020 is presented below:\nThe total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market price) of options exercised during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n92\n, $\n516\nand $\n506\n, respectively. During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of these awards.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $\n57\nof total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.7\nyears.\nAt January 1, 2020, the number of LTIP performance shares outstanding was equivalent to\n4,386,784\nshares. During 2020,\n2,064,598\nperformance shares were granted,\n676,282\nshares vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and\n1,340,303\nshares were forfeited. At December 31, 2020, performance shares outstanding were\n4,434,797\n. The fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $\n385\n, and was measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method.\nAt January 1, 2020, the number of restricted stock units outstanding was equivalent to\n2,512,345\nshares. During 2020,\n1,253,337\nrestricted stock units were granted,\n165,007\nunits vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and\n296,742\nunits were forfeited. At December 31, 2020, restricted stock units outstanding were\n3,303,933\n. The fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $\n197\n, valued at the stock price as of December 31, 2020. In addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights that were granted under LTIP totaled approximately\n4.1\nmillion equivalent shares as of December 31, 2020. The fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $\n34\n.\nNote 21\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nThe company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives.\nThe company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. For the company’s main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than\n4\npercent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.\nThe company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n87\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nThe funded status of the company’s pension and OPEB plans for 2020 and 2019 follows:\nAmounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the company’s pension and OPEB plans at December 31, 2020 and 2019, include:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the increase in benefit obligations was primarily due to actuarial losses caused by lower discount rates used to value the obligations.\nAmounts recognized on a before-tax basis in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for the company’s pension and OPEB plans were $\n7,278\nand $\n6,357\nat the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts consisted of:\nThe accumulated benefit obligations for all U.S. and international pension plans were $\n13,608\nand $\n5,758\n, respectively, at December 31, 2020, and $\n12,781\nand $\n5,203\n, respectively, at December 31, 2019.\nInformation for U.S. and international pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, was:\n88\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for 2020, 2019 and 2018 are shown in the table below:\nAssumptions\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended December 31:\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\nThe company’s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies.\nFor 2020, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of\n6.50\npercent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for\n65\npercent of the company’s pension plan assets. In both 2019 and 2018, the company used a long-term rate of return of\n6.75\npercent for these plans.\nThe market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the\nthree months\npreceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the\nthree\n-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.\n89\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’s plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2020 were\n2.4\nfor the main U.S. pension plan and\n2.4\nfor the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates for these plans at the end of 2019 were\n3.1\nand\n3.1\npercent, respectively, while in 2018 they were\n4.2\nand\n4.3\npercent for these plans, respectively.\nOther Benefit Assumptions\nFor the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2020, for the main U.S. OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with\n6.1\npercent in 2021 and gradually decline to\n4.5\npercent for 2027 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2019, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with\n6.8\npercent in 2020 and gradually declined to\n4.5\npercent for 2025 and beyond.\nPlan Assets and Investment Strategy\nThe fair value measurements of the company’s pension plans for 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n1\nU.S. equities include investments in the company’s common stock in the amount of $\n4\nat December 31, 2020, and $\n6\nat December 31, 2019.\n2\nCollective Trusts/Mutual Funds for U.S. plans are entirely index funds; for International plans, they are mostly unit trust and index funds.\n3\nMixed funds are composed of funds that invest in both equity and fixed-income instruments in order to diversify and lower risk.\n4\nThe year-end valuations of the U.S. real estate assets are based on third-party appraisals that occur at least once a year for each property in the portfolio.\n5\nThe “Other” asset class includes net payables for securities purchased but not yet settled (Level 1); dividends and interest- and tax-related receivables (Level 2); insurance contracts (Level 3); and investments in private-equity limited partnerships (NAV).\n90\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nThe effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in Level 3 plan assets are outlined below:\nThe primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management.\nThe company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise\n91\npercent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans’ investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.\nFor the primary U.S. pension plan, the company’s Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities\n40\n–\n65\npercent, Fixed Income\n20\n–\n40\npercent, Real Estate\n0\n–\n15\npercent, Alternative Investments\n0\n–\n5\npercent and Cash\n0\n–\n25\npercent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines: Equities\n10\n–\n30\npercent, Fixed Income\n55\n–\n85\npercent, Real Estate\n5\n–\n15\npercent, and Cash\n0\n–\n5\npercent. The other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and illiquidity constraints. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds.\nThe company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.\nCash Contributions and Benefit Payments\nIn 2020, the company contributed $\n950\nand $\n263\nto its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In 2021, the company expects contributions to be approximately $\n1,050\nto its U.S. plans and $\n200\nto its international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments, tax law changes and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.\nThe company anticipates paying OPEB benefits of approximately $\n153\nin 2021; $\n155\nwas paid in 2020.\nThe following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years:\nEmployee Savings Investment Plan\nEligible employees of Chevron and certain of its subsidiaries participate in the Chevron Employee Savings Investment Plan (ESIP). Compensation expense for the ESIP totaled $\n281\n, $\n284\nand $\n270\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n91\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nBenefit Plan Trusts\nPrior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2020, the trust contained\n14.2\nmillion shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.\nPrior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, trust assets of $\n36\nand $\n35\n, respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts.\nEmployee Incentive Plans\nThe Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $\n462\n, $\n826\nand $\n1,048\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in\n, beginning on page 86.\nNote 22\nOther Contingencies and Commitments\nIncome Taxes\nThe company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to\n, beginning on page 79, for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nSettlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future examination.\nGuarantees\nThe company has\ntwo\nguarantees to equity affiliates totaling $\n391\n. Of this amount, $\n137\nis associated with a financing arrangement with an equity affiliate. Over the approximate\n1\n-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum amount will be reduced as payments are made by the affiliate. The remaining amount of $\n254\nis associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate\n7\n-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee.\nIndemnifications\nIn the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $\n200\n, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $\n200\nobligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997.\nAlthough the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.\nLong-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements\nThe company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which may relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2021 – $\n1,000\n; 2022 – $\n1,200\n; 2023 – $\n1,300\n; 2024 – $\n1,300\n; 2025 – $\n1,400\n; 2026 and after – $\n8,400\n. A portion of these commitments may\n92\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $\n500\nin 2020, $\n800\nin 2019 and $\n1,400\nin 2018.\nEnvironmental\nThe company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites, including, but not limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields, and mining sites.\nAlthough the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.\nChevron’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2020, was $\n1,139\n. Included in this balance was $\n247\nrelated to remediation activities at approximately\n145\nsites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions by regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.\nOf the remaining year-end 2020 environmental reserves balance of $\n892\n, $\n611\nis related to the company’s U.S. downstream operations, $\n47\nto its international downstream operations, $\n233\nto upstream operations and $\n1\nto other businesses. Liabilities at all sites were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both.\nThe company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2020 had a recorded liability that was material to the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.\nRefer to\non page 94 for a discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations.\nOther Contingencies\nGovernmental and other entities in California and other jurisdictions have filed legal proceedings against fossil fuel producing companies, including Chevron, purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of climate change. Further such proceedings are likely to be filed by other parties. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability and injunctions against the production of all fossil fuels that, while we believe remote, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change, and will vigorously defend against such proceedings.\nSeven coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed\n43\nseparate lawsuits in Louisiana against numerous oil and gas companies seeking damages for coastal erosion in or near oil fields located within Louisiana’s coastal zone under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA). Chevron entities are defendants in\n39\nof these cases. The lawsuits allege that the defendants’ historical operations were conducted without necessary permits or failed to comply with permits obtained and seek damages and other relief, including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations. Plaintiffs’ SLCRMA theories are unprecedented; thus, there remains significant uncertainty about the scope of the claims and alleged damages and any potential effects on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that the claims lack legal and factual merit and will continue to vigorously defend against such proceedings\n.\nChevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; joint venture partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims,\n93\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nindividually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses in future periods.\nThe company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, retire, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods.\nNote 23\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) both as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates.\nAROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation.\nThe following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nIn the table above, the amount associated with “Revisions in estimated cash flows” in 2020 reflects increased cost estimates to decommission wells, equipment and facilities. The long-term portion of the $\n13,616\nbalance at the end of 2020 was $\n11,877\n.\nNote 24\nRevenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers is presented in “Sales and other operating revenue” along with some activity that is accounted for outside the scope of Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 606, which is not material to this line, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “Purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to\nbeginning on page 74 for additional information on the company’s segmentation of revenue.\nReceivables related to revenue from contracts with customers are included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The net balance of these receivables was $\n7,631\nand $\n9,247\nat December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Other items included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” represent amounts due from partners for their share of joint venture operating and project costs and amounts due from others, primarily related to derivatives, leases, buy/sell arrangements and product exchanges, which are accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606\n.\nContract assets and related costs are reflected in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and contract liabilities are reflected in “Accrued liabilities” and “Deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts for these items are not material to the company’s financial position.\n94\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 25\nOther Financial Information\nEarnings in 2020 included after-tax gains of approximately $\n765\nrelating to the sale of certain properties. Of this amount, approximately $\n30\nand $\n735\nrelated to downstream and upstream, respectively. Earnings in 2019 included after-tax gains of approximately $\n1,500\nrelating to the sale of certain properties, of which approximately $\n50\nand $\n1,450\nrelated to downstream and upstream assets, respectively. Earnings in 2018 included after-tax gains of approximately $\n630\nrelating to the sale of certain properties, of which approximately $\n365\nand $\n265\nrelated to downstream and upstream assets, respectively. Earnings in 2020 included after-tax charges of approximately $\n4,800\nfor impairments and other asset write-offs related to upstream. Earnings in 2019 included after-tax charges of approximately $\n10,400\nfor impairments and other asset write-offs related to upstream. Earnings in 2018 included after-tax charges of approximately $\n2,000\nfor impairments and other asset write-offs related to upstream.\n*\nIncludes $(\n152\n), $(\n28\n) and $\n416\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the company’s share of equity affiliates’ foreign currency effects.\nThe company has $\n4,402\nin goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, all of which is in the upstream segment and primarily related to the 2005 acquisition of Unocal. The company tested this goodwill for impairment during 2020, and\nno\nimpairment was required.\nNote 26\nSummarized Financial Data – Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC\nChevron has a\n50\npercent equity ownership interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). Refer to\n, on page 77, for a discussion of CPChem operations.\nSummarized financial information for\n100\npercent of CPChem is presented in the table below:\nNote 27\nRestructuring and Reorganization Costs\nIn 2020, the company recorded severance accruals and adjustments for employee reduction programs related to enterprise-wide restructuring, which are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2021.\nA before-tax charge of $\n859\n($\n670\nafter-tax) was recorded in 2020, with $\n690\nreported as \"Operating expenses\" and $\n169\nreported as “Selling, general and administrative expenses\" on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Approximately $\n127\n($\n97\nafter-tax) is associated with terminations in U.S. Upstream, $\n288\n($\n228\nafter-tax) in International Upstream, $\n112\n($\n85\nafter-tax) in U.S. Downstream, $\n69\n($\n54\nafter-tax) in International Downstream and $\n263\n($\n206\nafter-tax) in All Other.\n95\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nDuring 2020, the company made payments of $\n396\nassociated with these liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes the accrued severance liability, which is classified as current on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNote 28\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\nChevron adopted Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2016-13\n,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses,\nand its related amendments at the effective date of January 1, 2020. The standard replaces the “incurred loss model” and requires an estimate of expected credit losses, measured over the contractual life of a financial instrument, that considers forecast of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. The cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings at January 1, 2020 was a reduction of $\n25\n, representing a decrease to the net accounts and notes receivable balances shown on the company’s consolidated balance sheet on page 61. Chevron’s expected credit loss allowance balance was $\n671\nas of December 31, 2020 and $\n849\nas of December 31, 2019, with a majority of the allowance relating to non-trade receivable balances. A reduction in the allowance for non-trade receivables of $\n550\nwas recorded in the second quarter as an agreement was reached with a government joint venture partner that resulted in the write-off of the associated receivable balances. Additionally, new allowances of $\n265\nwere recorded in the second and third quarters associated with other than trade receivables.\nThe majority of the company’s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of $\n9.5\nbillion as of December 31, 2020, which reflects the company’s diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company’s broad worldwide customer base. As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral. Once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists, the company applies a quantitative calculation to current trade receivable balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis, including probability of default and loss given default, which takes into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company’s historical loss data. This statistical approach becomes the basis of the company’s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days. The company continues to monitor credit risk in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant reduction in crude prices resulting from decreased demand associated with government-mandated travel restrictions.\nChevron's non-trade receivable balance was $\n3.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2020, which includes receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review. This management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts. Non-trade receivables also include employee and tax receivables that are deemed immaterial and low risk.\nEquity affiliate loans are also considered non-trade and during the second quarter 2020 review, a $\n560\nallowance was recognized within “Investments and advances” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNote 29\nAcquisition of Noble Energy, Inc.\nOn October 5, 2020, the company acquired Noble Energy, Inc., an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. Noble’s principal upstream operations are in the United States, the Eastern Mediterranean and West Africa. Noble’s operations also include an integrated midstream business in the United States. The acquisition of Noble provides the company with low-cost proved reserves, attractive undeveloped resources and cash-generating assets.\nThe aggregate purchase price of Noble was $\n4,109\n, with approximately\n58\nmillion shares of Chevron common stock issued as consideration in the transaction, representing approximately 3 percent of shares of Chevron common stock outstanding\n96\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nimmediately after the acquisition. As part of the transaction, the company recognized long-term debt and finance leases with a fair value of $\n9,231\n.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. Provisional fair value measurements were made for acquired assets and liabilities, and adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition date, as information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. Oil and gas properties were valued using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporated internally generated price assumptions and production profiles together with appropriate operating cost and development cost assumptions. Debt assumed in the acquisition was valued based on observable market prices for Noble’s debt. As a result of measuring the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at fair value, there was no goodwill or bargain purchase recognized.\nThe following table summarizes the values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nThe following unaudited pro forma summary presents the results of operations as if the acquisition of Noble had occurred January 1, 2019:\nThe pro forma summary uses estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time. Management believes the estimates and assumptions to be reasonable; however, actual results may differ significantly from this pro forma financial information. The pro forma information does not reflect any synergistic savings that might be achieved from combining the operations and is not intended to reflect the actual results that would have occurred had the companies actually been combined during the periods presented.\n97\nFive-Year Financial Summary\nUnaudited\n98\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nIn accordance with FASB and SEC disclosure requirements for oil and gas producing activities, this section provides supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and producing activities of the company in seven separate tables.

The company classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves: probable and possible. The potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.\nProved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.\nProved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.\nProved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the Manager of Global Reserves, an organization that is separate from the Upstream operating organization. The\n103\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nManager of Global Reserves has more than 30 years’ experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and graduate degrees in geoscience. His experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects, and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves processes. He has been named a Distinguished Lecturer by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and is an active member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the SEPM Society of Sedimentary Geologists and the Society of Petroleum Engineers.\nAll RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates.\nThe RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the\nChevron Corporation Reserves Manual,\nwhich provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.\nDuring the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company’s senior leadership team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board.\nRAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the\nChevron Corporation Reserves Manual\n.\nThe acquisition of Noble was completed on October 5, 2020. Given the timing of the acquisition, Chevron has continued to rely on legacy Noble reserves staff and processes for reviewing reserves with input and guidance from the Chevron Reserves Advisory Committee. The processes include internal reviews and an external audit.  Accordingly, Chevron continued to retain Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI), a third-party petroleum consulting firm, that completed an audit of the legacy Noble acquisition proved reserves at December 31, 2020 (representing approximately 15% of Chevron’s total reserves). Based upon their evaluation NSAI issued an unqualified audit opinion, and this report is attached as Exhibit 99.3 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTechnologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions\nIn 2020, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates.\nProved Undeveloped Reserves\nNoteworthy changes in proved undeveloped reserves are shown in the table below and discussed on the following page.\n104\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nIn 2020, Revisions include a reduction of 392 million BOE in the United States, primarily from the Midland and Delaware basins where 300 million BOE was attributed to demotions due to capital reductions, commodity price effects and performance revisions, and 75 million BOE from the Gulf of Mexico, primarily from commodity price effects at Anchor.  In Australia, there was a net reduction of 269 million BOE, primarily from demotion of compression volumes related to capital and approval delays at Jansz Io, partially offset by positive revisions at Gorgon (Gorgon and Jansz Io make up the Gorgon Project).  A reduction of 85 million BOE was recorded in Canada, primarily from commodity price effects at Kaybob Duvernay.  In Nigeria, there was a reduction of 67 million BOE, primarily from gas volume changes based on reduced demand and development plan changes at Meren.  In Venezuela, there was a demotion of 48 million BOE, due to impairment and accounting methodology change. These negative revisions were partially offset by an increase of 143 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily from entitlement effects at TCO and Karachaganak.\nIn 2020, Extensions and Discoveries of 108 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to portfolio optimizations where future drilling in various fields is being targeted toward liquids-rich reservoirs with higher execution efficiencies in the Midland and Delaware basins.\nThe differences in 2020 Extensions and Discoveries of 124 million BOE, between the net quantities of Proved reserves of 247 million BOE as reflected on pages 106 to 109 and net quantities of Proved Undeveloped of 123 million BOE, are primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as PUDs in the prior year but rather were recognized directly as proved developed.\nPurchases of 329 million BOE in 2020 include 326 million BOE from the Noble acquisition, primarily in Israel and the DJ basin in the United States.\nSales of 95 million BOE in 2020 include 77 million BOE from the sale of the company’s interest in Azerbaijan.\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2020 include 178 million BOE in the United States, primarily from the Midland and Delaware basin developments and 84 million BOE in Canada, Kazakhstan, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\nDuring 2020, investments totaling approximately $6.3 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves.  In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled approximately $3.4 billion, primarily related to development projects of the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan.  The United States accounted for about $2.1 billion related primarily to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico. In Africa, about $0.3 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada and other international locations were primarily responsible for about $0.5 billion of expenditures.\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\nAt year-end 2020, the company held approximately 1.6 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 400 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the Gorgon and Wheatstone Projects.  Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 200 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 1.3 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 900 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more, with the majority related to the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2020, decreases in commodity prices negatively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in proved reserve decreases, and positively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves\n105\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nsections. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 31 percent and 38 percent.\nProved Reserve Quantities\nFor the three years ending December 31, 2020, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company’s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest.\nAt December 31, 2020, proved reserves for the company were 11.1 billion BOE. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of liquids including crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 are shown in the table on page 107. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids are shown on page 108 and the company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 109.\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2018 through 2020 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\nRevisions\nIn 2018, improved field performance at various Gulf of Mexico fields and in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 121 million barrel increase in the United States. Improved field performance at various fields, including Agbami in Nigeria and Moho-Bilondo in the Republic of Congo, were responsible for the 61 million barrel increase in Africa. Reserves in Other Americas increased by 59 million barrels, primarily due to improved field performance at the Hebron field in Canada. In Asia, improved performance across numerous assets resulted in the 37 million barrel increase.\nIn 2019, portfolio optimizations, where future drilling in various fields in the Midland and Delaware basins is being targeted away from reservoirs with higher gas-to-oil ratios and lower execution efficiencies, and planned divestments in the Appalachian basin, were primarily responsible for the 153 million barrel decrease in the United States. Operational issues with the Petropiar upgrader in Venezuela resulted in a decrease in reserves of synthetic oil of 126 million barrels and an increase of crude oil and condensate reserves of 105 million barrels. Reservoir management and entitlement effects were mainly responsible for 75 million barrels increase in the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. Improved field performance at various fields, including Moho-Bilondo in the Republic of Congo, Mafumeria in Angola, and Sonam in Nigeria, were responsible for the 42 million barrel increase in Africa.\nIn 2020, capital reductions and commodity price effects in the Midland and Delaware basins and Anchor in the Gulf of Mexico, were primarily responsible for the 279 million barrels decrease in the United States.  Reserves in Venezuela affiliates decreased by 149 million barrels, primarily due to impairments and accounting methodology change.  Entitlement effects and performance revisions in the TCO affiliate were primarily responsible for the 180 million barrels increase.  Entitlement effects primarily contributed to an increase of 77 million barrels synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil sands in Canada and 74 million barrels at multiple locations in Asia.\nExtensions and Discoveries\nIn 2018, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 359 million barrel increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries in the Duvernay Shale in Canada and Loma Campana in Argentina were primarily responsible for the 31 million barrel increase in Other Americas.\nIn 2019, portfolio optimizations, where future drilling in various fields in the Midland and Delaware basins is being targeted towards liquids-rich reservoirs with higher execution efficiencies, and extensions and discoveries in the deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico, were primarily responsible for the 394 million barrel increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries in Loma Campana in Argentina were primarily responsible for the 39 million barrel increase in Other Americas.\nIn 2020, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 105 million barrels increase in the United States.\nPurchases\nIn 2018, purchases of 31 million barrels in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.\nIn 2020, the acquisition of Noble assets contributed 227 million barrels in the DJ basin, Midland and Delaware basins in the United States.\nSales\nIn 2019, sales of 69 million barrels in Europe were in the United Kingdom and Denmark.\nIn 2020, sale of 99 million barrels in Asia were in Azerbaijan.\n106\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nNet Proved Reserves of Crude Oil, Condensate and Synthetic Oil\n1\nEnding reserve balances in North America were 166, 230 and 269 and in South America were 94, 90 and 72 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n2\nReserves associated with Canada.\n3\nEnding reserve balances in Africa were 3, 3 and 3 and in South America were 0, 156 and 64 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n4\nIncluded are year-end reserve quantities related to production-sharing contracts (PSC) (refer to page E-7 for the definition of a PSC).

The Bibiyana Field in Bangladesh and the Pattani Field in Thailand were primarily responsible for the 347 BCF increase in Asia. Improved performance in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 258 BCF increase in the United States.\nIn 2019, strong performances at Wheatstone and the greater Gorgon areas were mainly responsible for 1.7 TCF increase in Australia. In the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, reservoir management and entitlement effects were mainly responsible for 223 BCF increase. Portfolio optimizations and low price realizations in various fields of the Midland and Delaware basins and planned divestments in the Appalachian basin were mainly responsible for the 2.6 TCF decrease in the United States.\nIn 2020, the demotion of Jansz Io compression project reserves and lower field performance, partially offset by positive revisions at Gorgon, were mainly responsible for the net 2.5 TCF decrease in Australia.  Capital reductions and commodity price effects in various fields of the Midland and Delaware basins were mainly responsible for the 509 BCF decrease in the United States. In Africa, a 229 BCF decrease was primarily due to reduced demand and development plan changes at Meren in Nigeria.\nExtensions and Discoveries\nIn 2018, extensions and discoveries of 1.6 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian region and the Midland and Delaware basins.\nIn 2019, extensions and discoveries of 1.0 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.\nIn 2020, extensions and discoveries of 385 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.\n108\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nPurchases\nIn 2020, the acquisition of Noble assets contributed 5.4 TCF in Israel in Asia, 1.5 TCF in the Denver Julesburg basin, Midland and Delaware basins and Eagle Ford Shale in the United States and 441 BCF in Equatorial Guinea in Africa.\nSales\nIn 2019, sales of 240 BCF in Europe were in the United Kingdom and Denmark.\nIn 2020, sales of 1.3 TCF were primarily in the Appalachian basin, in the United States and 264 BCF primarily in Azerbaijan in Asia.\nNet Proved Reserves of Natural Gas\n1\nEnding reserve balances in North America and South America were 234, 462, 582 and 95, 274, 281 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n2\nEnding reserve balances in Africa and South America were 898, 802, 799 and 0, 64, 110 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n3\nTotal “as sold” volumes are 2,447, 2,379 and 2,289 for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n4\nIncludes reserve quantities related to production-sharing contracts (PSC) (refer to page E-7 for the definition of a PSC). PSC-related reserve quantities are 10 percent, 10 percent and 10 percent for consolidated companies for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n109\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nTable VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements. This includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition to those future wells and facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent management’s estimate of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption “Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.\n110\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nTable VII - Changes in the Standardized Measure\nof Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves\nThe changes in present values between years, which can be significant, reflect changes in estimated proved-reserve quantities and prices and assumptions used in forecasting production volumes and costs. Changes in the timing of production are included with “Revisions of previous quantity estimates.”\n111\nPART IV"
