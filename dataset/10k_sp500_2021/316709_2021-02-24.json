    "text": "General Corporate Overview\nThe Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC) is a savings and loan holding company. Incorporated in 1986, CSC engages, through its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as Schwab or the Company), in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services. At December 31, 2020, Schwab had $6.69 trillion in client assets, 29.6 million active brokerage accounts, 2.1 million corporate retirement plan participants, and 1.5 million banking accounts.\nPrincipal business subsidiaries of CSC include the following:\n•\nCharles Schwab & Co., Inc. (CS&Co), incorporated in 1971, a securities broker-dealer;\n•\nTD Ameritrade, Inc., an introducing securities broker-dealer;\n•\nTD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc. (TDAC), a securities broker-dealer that provides trade execution and clearing services to TD Ameritrade, Inc.;\n•\nCharles Schwab Bank, SSB (CSB), our principal banking entity; and\n•\nCharles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM), the investment advisor for Schwab’s proprietary mutual funds (Schwab Funds\n®\n) and for Schwab’s exchange-traded funds (Schwab ETFs\n™\n).\nUnless otherwise indicated, the terms “Schwab,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean CSC together with its consolidated subsidiaries.\nSchwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent registered investment advisors (RIAs), independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. These services are further described in the segment discussion below.\nEffective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (TDA Holding) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “TD Ameritrade” or “TDA”). TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries; and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its futures commission merchant (FCM) and forex dealer member (FDM) subsidiary. The TD Ameritrade acquisition is further described in the business and asset acquisition discussion below.\nEffective January 1, 2021, CSC changed the designation of its corporate headquarters from San Francisco, California to Westlake, Texas. The Company maintains a nationwide presence across a network of branches and operations centers, and our Westlake location provides a centrally located hub for the Company.\nBusiness Strategy and Competitive Environment\nSchwab was founded on the belief that all Americans deserve access to a better investing experience. Although much has changed in the intervening years, our purpose remains clear – to champion every client’s goals with passion and integrity. Guided by this purpose and our vision of creating the most trusted leader in investment services, management has adopted a strategy described as “Through Clients’ Eyes.”\nThis strategy emphasizes placing clients’ perspectives, needs, and desires at the forefront. Because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security, we strive to deliver a better investing experience for our clients – individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them – by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service. We also aim to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency, value, and trust. In addition, management works to couple Schwab’s scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as responsive to client needs. In\n- 1 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\ncombination, these are the key elements of our “no trade-offs” approach to serving investors. We believe that following this strategy is the best way to maximize our market valuation and stockholder returns over time.\nManagement estimates that investable wealth in the United States (U.S.) (consisting of assets in defined contribution, retail wealth management and brokerage, and registered investment advisor channels, along with bank deposits) currently exceeds $50 trillion, which means the Company’s $6.69 trillion in client assets leaves substantial opportunity for growth. Our strategy is based on the principle that developing trusted relationships will translate into more assets from both new and existing clients, ultimately driving more revenue, and along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management, will generate earnings growth and build long-term stockholder value.\nWithin Investor Services, our competition in serving individual investors spans brokerage, wealth management, and asset management firms, as well as banks and trust companies. In the Advisor Services arena, we compete with institutional custodians, traditional and discount brokers, banks, and trust companies.\nAcross both segments, our key competitive advantages are:\n•\nScale and Size of the Business – As one of the largest investment services firms in the U.S., we are able to spread operating costs and amortize new investments over a large base of clients, and harness the resources to evolve capabilities to meet client needs.\n•\nOperating Efficiency – Coupled with scale, our operating efficiency and sharing of infrastructure across different businesses creates a cost advantage that enables us to competitively price products and services while profitably serving clients of various sizes across multiple channels.\n•\nOperating Structure – Providing bank and asset management services to broker-dealer clients helps serve a wider array of needs, thereby deepening relationships, enhancing the stability of client assets, and enabling diversified revenue streams.\n•\nBrand and Corporate Reputation – In an industry dependent on trust, Schwab’s reputation and brand across multiple constituents enable us to attract clients and employees while credibly introducing new products to the market.\n•\nService Culture – Delivering a great client experience earns the trust and loyalty of clients and increases the likelihood that those clients will refer others.\n•\nWillingness to Disrupt – Management’s willingness to challenge the status quo, including our own business practices, to benefit clients fosters innovation and continuous improvement, which helps to attract more clients and assets.\nBusiness and Asset Acquisitions\nAcquisition of TD Ameritrade\nEffective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. In exchange for each share of TD Ameritrade common stock, TD Ameritrade stockholders received 1.0837 shares of CSC common stock, except for The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank) and its affiliates which received a portion in nonvoting common stock. In connection with the transaction, Schwab issued approximately 586 million common shares to TD Ameritrade stockholders consisting of approximately 509 million shares of common stock and 77 million shares of nonvoting common stock. Upon completion of the acquisition, TDA Holding became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC.\nTDA provides services to individual retail investors and to RIAs predominantly through the Internet, a national branch network, and relationships with RIAs. At the time of acquisition, TD Ameritrade had approximately 10,000 employees. TD Ameritrade’s sources of net revenues primarily consist of trading revenue, bank deposit account fees, net interest revenue, and asset management and administration fees.\n•\nTDA’s trading revenue includes commissions earned on trades of certain securities and derivatives, as well as order flow revenue.\n•\nBank deposit account fees are earned through an insured deposit account agreement with TD Bank USA, National Association and TD Bank, National Association (together, the TD Depository Institutions), as well as bank deposit account sweep agreements with other third-party depository institutions, whereby uninvested cash held by certain brokerage clients is swept into Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured (up to specified limits) money market deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party depository institutions. See discussion below of the IDA agreement that became effective at the acquisition date.\n- 2 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n•\nTDA’s net interest revenue is generated primarily through margin lending, securities lending activity, as well as segregated and operating cash and investments. Interest-bearing liabilities primarily consist of interest-bearing payables to brokerage clients and long-term debt.\n•\nTDA’s asset management and administration fee revenue includes revenues earned on client assets invested in money market funds, other mutual funds, and certain investment programs. TDA’s asset management and administration fees also include referral and asset-based program fees on its client assets managed by independent RIAs utilizing TDA’s trading and investing platforms.\nConcurrently with the execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 24, 2019, as amended (the Merger Agreement), CSC entered into a stockholder agreement with TD Bank (the Stockholder Agreement), a registration rights agreement with TD Bank and Charles R. Schwab, and an amended and restated insured deposit account agreement with the TD Depository Institutions (the IDA agreement).\nEffective upon the merger, Todd M. Ricketts, Brian M. Levitt, and Bharat B. Masrani were elected to CSC’s Board of Directors. Mr. Ricketts was designated by TD Ameritrade pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and Messrs. Levitt and Masrani were designated by TD Bank pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement between Schwab and TD Bank.\nIntegration Overview\nWe anticipate the acquisition of TD Ameritrade will significantly increase our scale to help support the Company’s ongoing efforts to enhance the client experience, provide deeper resources for individual investors as well as RIAs, and continue to improve our operating efficiency. At the time of closing, TDA had approximately $1.6 trillion in client assets and approximately 14.5 million brokerage accounts. We anticipate combining the respective strengths of Schwab and TD Ameritrade will enable the Company to invest in enhanced client experience capabilities and further our financial success to the benefit of clients, employees, and stockholders.\nThroughout the integration, the Company plans to generally adopt Schwab platforms and systems, though we’re committed to leveraging material advantages in TD Ameritrade’s platforms when appropriate, as exemplified by our intention to retain TD Ameritrade’s thinkorswim\n®\nand thinkpipes\n®\ntrading platforms, education, and tools into our offerings for retail and RIA clients. We also plan to retain TD Ameritrade Institutional’s customizable portfolio rebalancing solution iRebal\n®\nas part of our offering for independent advisor clients. Additional technology solutions continue to be evaluated for consideration as part of the combined platform.\nOur integration of TD Ameritrade’s operations is expected to occur over 18 to 36 months from the date of acquisition, though planning for integration has been underway since the acquisition was announced on November 25, 2019. In October 2020, the Company began efforts to reduce overlapping or redundant roles across the two firms and to rationalize branch locations of CS&Co and TD Ameritrade, Inc. These and other integration activities are expected to continue throughout the integration process. CS&Co, as well as TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC, will continue to operate as separate broker-dealers to serve their respective clients while integration work continues.\nIDA Agreement\nIn accordance with the IDA agreement, which became effective October 6, 2020, cash held in eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to money market deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides marketing, recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the money market deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee, determined by reference to certain yields, less a service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions, FDIC deposit assessments, and interest on deposits paid to clients. Under the IDA agreement, the service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions was reduced, relative to TD Ameritrade’s agreement prior to acquisition, by 40%, from 25 basis points to 15 basis points for the life of the agreement. Under TDA’s prior insured deposit account agreement with the TD Depository Institutions, TDA had floors in place which enabled it to carve-out up to $20 billion of floating-rate investments from the applicable service fee during specified low-rate environments. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, the 15 basis point service fee now applies across all designated fixed and floating IDA balances.\nPursuant to the IDA agreement, Schwab will be required to move all uninsured IDA balances out of the IDA sweep program on June 30, 2021. The IDA agreement also provides that starting July 1, 2021, Schwab will have the option to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances every 12 months to Schwab’s balance sheet, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. The\n- 3 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nCompany’s ability to migrate these balances out of the IDA sweep program is dependent on certain binding limitations specified in the IDA agreement, including the requirement that Schwab can only move IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. The amount of Schwab’s initial potential transfer will also be affected by the net growth or decline in the IDA balance from immediately prior to the October 6, 2020 effective date of the IDA agreement through June 30, 2021. In addition, Schwab also must maintain a minimum $50 billion IDA balance through June 2031, and at least 80% of the IDA balances must be designated as fixed-rate obligations through June 2026.\nSee “Part II – Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” (Item 8) – Note 3 for more information on the TD Ameritrade acquisition. See also “Part II – Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) – Capital Management” and Item 8 – Note 15 for additional information on the IDA agreement.\nAcquisition of Assets of USAA’s Investment Management Company\nOn May 26, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the assets of USAA’s Investment Management Company (USAA-IMCO) for $1.6 billion in cash. Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition has added scale to the Company’s operations through the addition of 1.1 million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA’s members through the long-term referral agreement. See Item 8 – Note 3 for more information on the USAA-IMCO acquisition.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of technology and intellectual property of Motif, a financial technology company. The Motif assets help us build on our existing capabilities and help accelerate our development of thematic and direct index investing for Schwab’s retail investors and RIA clients. Also during 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Wasmer, Schroeder & Company, LLC (Wasmer Schroeder), which adds established strategies and new separately managed account offerings to our fixed income lineup.\nSources of Net Revenues\nOur largest sources of net revenues are net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, trading revenue, and bank deposit account fees. These revenue streams are supported by the combination of bank, broker-dealer, and asset management operating subsidiaries, including those of TD Ameritrade, each of which brings specific capabilities that enable us to provide clients with the products and services they are seeking.\nNet interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. The majority of net interest revenue is derived from a portion of client cash balances awaiting investment and held on Schwab’s balance sheet as part of clients’ overall relationship with the Company. Interest-earning assets are primarily comprised of high-quality fixed income securities, margin loans, and bank loans.\nThe majority of asset management and administration fees are earned from proprietary money market mutual funds, proprietary and third-party mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and fee-based advisory solutions.\nTrading revenue includes commissions earned for executing trades for clients in certain individual equities, options, futures, fixed income securities, and certain third-party mutual funds and ETFs; order flow revenue; and principal transaction revenue earned primarily from actions to support client trading in fixed income securities. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, Schwab eliminated online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options.\nBank deposit account fees are primarily recognized pursuant to the Company’s IDA agreement, as well as sweep agreements with other third-party depository institutions. Under the IDA agreement, eligible brokerage client accounts are swept off-balance sheet to money market deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides marketing, recordkeeping, and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the money market deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee, determined by reference to certain yields, less a service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions, FDIC deposit assessments, and interest on deposits paid to clients.\n- 4 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nProducts and Services\nWe offer a broad range of products through intuitive end-to-end solutions, including robust digital capabilities, to address our clients’ varying investment and financial needs. Examples of these product offerings include the following:\n•\nBrokerage – an array of full-feature brokerage accounts with equity and fixed income trading, margin lending, options trading, futures and forex trading, and cash management capabilities including third-party certificates of deposit;\n•\nMutual funds – third-party mutual funds through the Mutual Fund Marketplace\n®\n, including non-transaction fee mutual funds through the Mutual Fund OneSource\n®\nservice, which also includes proprietary mutual funds, plus mutual fund trading and clearing services to broker-dealers;\n•\nExchange-traded funds – an extensive offering of ETFs, including both proprietary and third-party ETFs;\n•\nAdvice solutions – managed portfolios of both proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs, separately managed accounts, customized personal advice for tailored portfolios, specialized planning, and full-time portfolio management;\n•\nBanking – checking and savings accounts, first lien residential real estate mortgage loans (First Mortgages), home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and pledged asset lines (PALs); and\n•\nTrust – trust custody services, personal trust reporting services, and administrative trustee services.\nThese investing services are made available through two business segments – Investor Services and Advisor Services. Schwab’s major sources of revenues are generated by both of the reportable segments, based on their respective levels of client assets and activity. Revenue is attributable to a reportable segment based on which segment has the primary responsibility for serving the client. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Item 8 – Note 2.\nInvestor Services\nCharles Schwab initially founded the Company over 40 years ago to provide individual investors with access to the financial markets at a reasonable cost. The Company has been expanding offerings over time in response to client needs, aiming to provide a compelling and often disruptive solution in the marketplace. As products and services have evolved over the years, the Investor Services segment has expanded and now includes the Retail Investor, Retirement Plan Services, Mutual Fund Clearing Services, and Off-Platform Sales business units.\nThrough the Retail Investor business unit, we offer individual investors a multi-channel service delivery model, which includes online, mobile, telephone, and branch capabilities. We provide personalized solutions at competitive prices while giving clients the choice of where, when, and how they do business with us. Financial Consultants (FCs) in Schwab’s branches and regional telephone service centers focus on building and sustaining client relationships. We have the ability to meet client investing needs through a single ongoing point of contact, even as those needs change over time. We believe that this ability to provide those clients seeking help, guidance, or advice with an individually tailored approach – ranging from occasional consultations, to an ongoing relationship with an FC or participation in one of our advisory solutions, which include referral to an independent RIA in the Schwab Advisor Network\n®\n, or for clients of TDA, an RIA in the AdvisorDirect\n®\nprogram – is a competitive strength compared to the more fragmented or limited offerings of other firms.\nOur service delivery model provides quick and efficient access to a broad lineup of information, research, tools, trade execution, and administrative services, which clients can access according to their needs. For example, clients that trade more actively can use these channels to access highly competitive pricing, expert tools, and extensive service capabilities – including experienced, knowledgeable teams of trading specialists, and integrated product offerings. Management also believes the Company is able to compete with the wide variety of financial services firms striving to attract individual client relationships by complementing these capabilities with a range of investment and banking products.\nSchwab seeks to educate and assist clients in reaching their financial goals. Educational tools include workshops, webcasts, podcasts, interactive courses, and online information about investing, from which Schwab does not earn revenue. We also introduced virtual events in 2020 to engage with retail and institutional clients amidst an unprecedented climate. Additionally, we provide various online research and analysis tools that are designed to help clients achieve better investment outcomes. As an example of such tools, Schwab Equity Ratings\n®\nis a quantitative model-based stock rating system that provides all clients with ratings on approximately 3,000 stocks, assigning each equity a single grade: A, B, C, D, or F. Schwab Equity Ratings International\n®\n, an international ranking methodology, covers stocks of approximately 4,000 foreign companies. In 2020, we launched Schwab Plan\n™\n, a free digital financial plan designed to help investors establish and stay on track toward their personalized retirement goals. Schwab Plan is available to all Schwab clients with no\n- 5 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nminimum asset requirement, expanding access to retirement planning to the millions of retail investors that Schwab serves\n.\nAlso in 2020, we launched Schwab Stock Slices\n™\n, a service which enables investors to own any of America’s leading companies from the S&P 500\n®\nfor as little as $5 each, even if their shares cost more. Clients can purchase a single stock slice or up to 10 different stock slices at once, commission-free through our online channels.\nClients may seek specific investment recommendations, either from time to time or on an ongoing basis. Schwab provides clients seeking advice with personalized solutions. Our approach to advice is based on long-term investment strategies and guidance on portfolio diversification and asset allocation. This approach is designed to be offered consistently across all of Schwab’s delivery channels.\nSchwab Private Client\n™\nfeatures a personal advice relationship with a designated Private Client Advisor, supported by a team of investment professionals who provide individualized service, a customized investment strategy developed in collaboration with the client, and ongoing guidance and execution.\nFor clients seeking a relationship in which investment decisions are fully delegated to a financial professional, Schwab offers several alternatives. We provide investors access to professional investment management in a diversified account that is invested exclusively in either mutual funds or ETFs through the Schwab Managed Portfolios\n™\nand the Windhaven Investment Management\n®\nStrategies, or equity securities and ETFs through the ThomasPartners Investment Management\n®\nStrategies. During 2020, we completed our acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder, which adds established strategies and new separately managed account offerings to our existing fixed income lineup. We also refer investors who want to utilize a specific third-party money manager to direct a portion of their investment assets to the Schwab Managed Account\n™\nprogram. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios\n®\n, available since 2015, are for clients who are looking to have their assets professionally managed via a fully automated online investment advisory service. In late 2016, we introduced a hybrid advisory service, now called Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium\n®\n, to offer our clients an advisory service which combines unlimited guidance provided by a C\nERTIFIED\nF\nINANCIAL\nP\nLANNER\n™\nand our robo-advice technology to make financial and investment planning more accessible to investors. In early 2020, we launched Schwab Intelligent Income\n®\n, a low-cost solution designed to offer a simple, modern way to generate income from existing investment portfolios. Finally, clients who want the assistance of an independent professional in managing their financial affairs may be referred to RIAs in the Schwab Advisor Network. These RIAs provide personalized portfolio management, financial planning, and wealth management solutions.\nClients of TD Ameritrade also have access to a suite of programs designed to meet their specific investment advisory needs. Through TDA’s Essential Portfolios, clients are offered a low-cost automated online investment advisory service with access to goal-oriented ETF portfolios. TDA’s Selective Portfolios offers a broader range of goal-oriented portfolios made up of mutual funds and ETFs, through a combination of automated technology and professional insights. TDA’s Personalized Portfolios offers clients tailored portfolios, supported by a team of investment professionals. Finally, TDA’s AdvisorDirect\n®\nreferral program provides clients with an introduction to an independent RIA that can assist in developing customized investment strategies around their unique goals.\nTo meet the specific needs of clients who actively trade, Schwab offers integrated web- and software-based trading platforms, real-time market data, options trading, premium stock and futures research, and multi-channel access, as well as sophisticated account and trade management features, risk management and decision support tools, and dedicated personal support. TD Ameritrade offers clients its award-winning thinkorswim\n®\ntrading platform, education, and tools, which the Company intends to integrate into the Company’s ongoing offerings.\nFor U.S. clients wishing to invest in foreign equities, we offer a suite of global investing capabilities, including online access to certain foreign equity markets with the ability to trade in their local currencies. In addition, Schwab serves both foreign investors and non-English-speaking U.S. clients who wish to trade or invest in U.S. dollar-based securities. Schwab provides multi-lingual services to non-English-speaking clients through a combination of its branch offices, web-based and telephonic services.\nWe also offer equity compensation plan sponsors full-service recordkeeping for stock plans, stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, and stock appreciation rights. Specialized services for executive transactions and reporting, grant acceptance tracking, and other services are offered to employers to meet the needs of administering the reporting and compliance aspects of an equity compensation plan.\nOur Retirement Plan Services business unit offers a bundled 401(k) retirement plan product that provides retirement plan sponsors with extensive investment options, trustee or custodial services, and participant-level recordkeeping. Retirement plan design features, which increase plan efficiency and achieve employer goals, are also offered, such as automatic\n- 6 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nenrollment, automatic fund mapping at conversion, and automatic contribution increases. In addition to an open architecture investment platform, we offer access to low cost index mutual funds and ETFs. Individuals investing for retirement through 401(k) plans can take advantage of bundled offerings of multiple investment choices, education, and third-party advice. This third-party advice service is delivered online, by phone, or in person, including recommendations based on the core investment fund choices in their retirement plan and specific recommended savings rates. Services also include support for Roth 401(k) accounts, profit sharing, and defined benefit plans.\nLastly, the Mutual Fund Clearing Services business unit provides open-end mutual fund trading, settlement, and related transactional services to banks, brokerage firms, and trust companies, and the Off-Platform Sales business unit offers proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, and collective trust funds (CTFs) outside the Company and not on the Schwab platform. They are included within the Investor Services segment given their leveraging of the products and services offered to individual investors.\nAdvisor Services\nMore than thirty years ago, Schwab supported a small group of entrepreneurial advisors who challenged the industry by creating independent firms. Through the Advisor Services segment, Schwab has become one of the largest providers of custodial, trading, banking, and support services to RIAs and their clients. We also provide retirement business services to independent retirement advisors and recordkeepers. Management believes that we can maintain our market position primarily through the efforts of our sales, support, technology, and business consulting service teams, which are dedicated to helping RIAs grow, compete, and succeed in serving their clients. In addition to focusing on superior service, we utilize technology to provide RIAs with a highly-developed, scalable platform for administering their clients’ assets easily and efficiently. Advisor Services sponsors and hosts a variety of national, regional, local, and virtual events designed to help RIAs of all sizes and complexities identify and implement better ways to expand and efficiently manage their practices.\nRIAs who custody client accounts at Schwab may use proprietary software that provides them with up-to-date client account information as well as trading capabilities. The Advisor Services website is the core platform for RIAs to conduct daily business activities online with Schwab, including viewing and managing client account information and accessing news and market information. The website provides account servicing capabilities for RIAs, including account opening, money movement, transfer of assets, trading, checking status, and communicating with our service team. The site provides multi-year archiving of statements, trade confirms, and tax reports, along with document search capabilities. We also provide access to integrations with third-party platforms, which support a variety of advisor needs including client relationship management, portfolio management systems, trade order management, and financial planning. In early 2019, we released Schwab Advisor Portfolio Connect\n®\n, a simplified portfolio management solution that is available free of charge to advisors to manage Schwab accounts. It delivers core capabilities and features through an intuitive modern experience, without the need to download and reconcile data.\nThe Advisor Services website also provides interactive tools, educational content, and thought leadership for advisors turning independent. We offer a variety of services to help RIAs grow and manage their practices, including business, technology, and operations consulting on a range of topics critical to an RIA’s success, as well as an annual RIA benchmarking study to help firms understand key business metrics relative to peers. We also offer an array of services to help advisors establish their own independent practices through a robust prospect consulting offer. To support them throughout their transition, we offer access to business start-up and transition consultants, technology engineers, and dedicated service teams.\nSchwab provides extensive educational materials, programs, and events to RIAs seeking to expand their knowledge of industry issues and trends, as well as sharpen their individual expertise and practice management skills. We conduct industry research on an ongoing basis, and hold a series of events and conferences every year to discuss topics of interest to RIAs, including business strategies and best practices. Schwab sponsors and hosts the annual IMPACT\n®\nconference, which provides a national forum for the Company, RIAs, and other industry participants to gather and share information and insights, as well as a multitude of smaller events across the country each year.\nRIAs and their clients have access to our broad range of products and services, including individual securities, mutual funds, ETFs, fixed income products, managed accounts, cash products, bank lending, and trust services. By functioning as the custodian, Schwab earns revenue associated with the underlying client assets, predominantly through net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees. In this capacity, we do not charge the RIA or end client a custody fee.\n- 7 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nFor RIAs on the TD Ameritrade Institutional platform, TD Ameritrade’s thinkpipes\n®\ntrading platform offers a multitude of features, including real-time charting and efficient trading and allocation. The Company intends to integrate thinkpipes into its ongoing offerings. The Company also plans to retain TD Ameritrade Institutional’s customizable portfolio rebalancing solution iRebal\n®\nas part of its offering for RIA clients.\nThe Advisor Services segment also includes the Retirement Business Services and Corporate Brokerage Retirement Services business units. Retirement Business Services provides trust, custody, and retirement business services to independent retirement plan advisors and independent recordkeepers. Retirement plan assets are held at Charles Schwab Trust Bank (Trust Bank). The Company and independent retirement plan providers work together to serve plan sponsors, combining the consulting and administrative expertise of the administrator with our investment, technology, trust, and custodial services. Retirement Business Services also offers the Schwab Personal Choice Retirement Account\n®\n, a self-directed brokerage offering for retirement plans.\nCorporate Brokerage Retirement Services serves plan sponsors, advisors, and independent recordkeepers seeking a brokerage-based account to hold retirement plan assets. Retirement plans held at Schwab are either self-trusteed or trusteed by a separate, independent trustee. Corporate Brokerage Retirement Services also offers the Schwab Personal Choice Retirement Account\n®\n, and the Company Retirement Account, both of which are self-directed brokerage-based solutions designed to hold the assets of company-sponsored retirement plans.\nRegulation\nAs a participant in the securities, banking and financial services industries, Schwab is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities, and self-regulatory organizations (SROs). We are also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which we operate. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements.\nHolding Company and Bank Regulation\nCSC is a savings and loan holding company and is regulated, supervised, and examined by the Federal Reserve. CSC’s three depository institution subsidiaries are CSB, CSC’s principal depository institution subsidiary, Charles Schwab Premier Bank, SSB (CSPB), and Trust Bank. On March 20, 2020, CSB and CSPB converted from federal savings associations headquartered in Henderson, Nevada to Texas-chartered savings banks headquartered in Westlake, Texas. Trust Bank is a Nevada-chartered savings bank headquartered in Henderson, Nevada. CSB and CSPB are currently regulated, supervised, and examined by the Federal Reserve, the Texas Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the FDIC. Trust Bank is currently regulated, supervised and examined by the Nevada Financial Institutions Division, CFPB, and the FDIC. CSC, CSB, CSPB, and Trust Bank are also subject to regulation and various requirements and restrictions under state and other federal laws.\nThis regulatory framework is designed to protect depositors and consumers, the safety and soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies, and the stability of the banking system as a whole. This framework affects the activities and investments of CSC and its subsidiaries and gives the regulatory authorities broad discretion in connection with their supervisory, examination and enforcement activities and policies. Below is a discussion of significant regulations.\nRegulatory Capital and Liquidity Framework\nBanking organizations are subject to the regulatory capital rules issued by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the FDIC. In addition to minimum risk-based capital requirements, banking organizations must hold additional capital, referred to as buffers, to avoid being subject to limits on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.\nIn October 2019, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC jointly adopted a final rule which became effective on December 31, 2019 (interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules) that revised the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements for large U.S. banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The rules established four risk-based categories for determining the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to these institutions based on their total assets, cross-jurisdictional activity, weighted short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. CSC is subject to the requirements under Category III based on its total consolidated assets of between $250 billion and less than $700 billion and having less than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity. As of December 31, 2020, CSC had total consolidated assets of $549 billion.\n- 8 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nCapital requirements for Category III banking organizations include the generally applicable risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratio requirements (the “standardized approach” framework), the minimum 3.0% supplementary leverage ratio, the countercyclical capital buffer, which is currently 0%, and for large bank holding companies, the stress capital buffer. As discussed below, starting in 2022, CSC, as a large savings and loan holding company will also become subject to the stress capital buffer requirement. Under the revised capital requirements, Category III organizations are not subject to the “advanced approaches” regulatory capital framework and are permitted to opt out of including accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in their regulatory capital calculations. CSC made this opt out election, and commencing with the first quarter of 2020, now excludes AOCI from its regulatory capital.\nAs revised by the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules, Category III banking organizations with less than $75 billion in average weighted short-term wholesale funding, which includes CSC, and their depository institution subsidiaries with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets are subject to a reduced liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) rule requiring them to hold high quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to at least 85% of their projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30-calendar-day period of acute liquidity stress, calculated on each business day. If an institution’s average weighted short-term wholesale funding over the four most recent quarters is $75 billion or more, it will be required to comply with the full LCR rule and hold HQLA in an amount equal to 100% of its projected 30-day net cash outflows and will also be subject to daily (instead of monthly) liquidity reporting. We anticipate that we will exceed the $75 billion threshold as of the quarter ended March 31, 2021, and will become subject to daily liquidity reporting on July 1, 2021, and the full LCR rule on October 1, 2021.\nIn October 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC jointly adopted a final net stable funding ratio (NSFR) rule to strengthen the resilience of large bank and savings and loan holding companies by requiring them to maintain a minimum level of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of the holding company’s assets, commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time horizon. The requirement is expressed as a ratio of a banking entity’s available stable funding (ASF) to its required stable funding (RSF). Category III banking organizations with less than $75 billion in average weighted short-term wholesale funding, which includes CSC, and their depository institution subsidiaries with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets will be required to maintain ASF in an amount at least equal to 85% of its RSF on an ongoing, daily basis. The final NSFR rule becomes effective on July 1, 2021, and banking entities subject to the rule will be required to publicly disclose their quarterly NSFRs on a semi-annual basis beginning with the first and second quarters of 2023. While we will be subject to the reduced NSFR when the rule goes into effect on July 1, 2021, we anticipate that we will become subject to the full NSFR requirement on October 1, 2021.\nCapital Stress Testing\nIn the final enhanced prudential standards rules adopted concurrently in October 2019 with the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules, the Federal Reserve revised the capital stress testing regime applicable to savings and loan holding companies and state-chartered member banks. Under the new Federal Reserve capital stress testing rules, savings and loan holding companies that are Category III banking organizations are required to conduct biennial company-run stress tests in even-numbered years beginning in 2020. In 2020, CSC conducted company-run stress tests, reported the results of its stress testing to the Federal Reserve, and voluntarily published a summary of its stress test results.\nIn its enhanced prudential standards rules, the Federal Reserve also made Category III savings and loan holding companies subject to an annual supervisory stress testing requirement in which the Federal Reserve conducts its own stress testing analysis to evaluate the ability of a holding company to absorb losses in specified economic and financial conditions over a nine-quarter planning horizon using such analytical techniques as the agency determines are appropriate. This supervisory stress testing requirement will go into effect for CSC beginning with the 2022 stress testing cycle. To implement this requirement, the Federal Reserve also expanded the reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies commencing in the second quarter of 2020.\nIn January 2021, the Federal Reserve adopted a new rule making savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, including CSC, subject to an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, which requires submission of an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve. The rule also imposes a stress capital buffer requirement, floored at 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, that will replace CSC’s current 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer. The capital plan requirement will become effective for CSC with the 2022 CCAR cycle, and CSC’s initial stress capital buffer requirement will be based on its 2022 CCAR stress testing results.\n- 9 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nAdditional Enhanced Prudential Standards\nIn addition to the revisions to the capital stress testing regime discussed above, the Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential standards rules will also extend the applicability of certain additional enhanced prudential standards to large savings and loan holding companies, with the specific requirements tailored based on the same four-category framework utilized in the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules. These additional enhanced prudential standards, which have been applicable to large U.S. bank holding companies under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), include: risk management and risk committee requirements; liquidity risk management, stress testing, and buffer requirements; and single counterparty credit limits. CSC will be required to comply with the new risk management and risk committee requirements, as well as the new liquidity risk-management, stress testing, and buffer requirements commencing on January 1, 2021. The new single counterparty credit limits will go into effect for CSC on January 1, 2022.\nInsured Depository Institution Resolution Plans\nThe FDIC requires insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit to the FDIC periodic plans providing for their resolution by the FDIC in the event of failure (resolution plans or so-called “living wills”) under the receivership and liquidation provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Under this requirement, CSB has been required to file with the FDIC a periodic resolution plan demonstrating how the bank could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership such that the FDIC would be able to: ensure that the bank’s depositors receive access to their deposits within one business day; maximize the net present value of the bank’s assets when disposed of; and minimize losses incurred by the bank’s creditors. In April 2019, the FDIC imposed a moratorium on resolution plan submissions. More recently, in January 2021, the FDIC announced that it will resume requiring resolution plan submissions for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more. The FDIC also indicated that it would provide at least 12 months’ notice before firms must submit new resolution plans.\nAs a savings and loan holding company, CSC is not subject to any separate holding company resolution plan requirement.\nConsumer Financial Protection\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority for a wide range of federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority over depository institutions with $10 billion or more in consolidated total assets.\nDeposit Insurance Assessments\nThe FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, generally up to $250,000 per depositor per account ownership type, and is funded by quarterly assessments on insured depository institutions. The FDIC uses a risk-based deposit premium assessment system that, for large insured depository institutions with at least $10 billion in total consolidated assets, uses a scorecard method based on a number of factors, including the institution’s regulatory ratings, asset quality and brokered deposits. The deposit insurance assessment base is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity.\nBrokered Deposits\nIn December 2020, the FDIC adopted amendments to its brokered deposits rule to establish a new framework for determining whether deposits made through arrangements between third parties and depository institutions constitute brokered deposits and more specifically to clarify the circumstances under which broker-dealers that place deposits with depository institutions through brokerage sweep arrangements such as CS&Co and TDAC will qualify for the “primary purpose exception” from the definition of a deposit broker. Under the new framework, the FDIC establishes a new “25 percent” business relationship designated exception where a broker-dealer or other third party may qualify for the primary purpose exception by filing a notice with the FDIC indicating that less than 25 percent of its customer assets under administration for a particular business line are placed at depository institutions. The FDIC’s brokered deposit rule amendments becomes effective on April 1, 2021. CSC anticipates that under the new framework funds swept by CS&Co to CSB and Schwab’s other depository institution subsidiaries will continue to qualify for the primary purpose exception, and that funds swept by TDAC under its bank sweep program will become eligible for the primary purpose exception.\n- 10 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) requires the primary federal bank regulatory agency for each of Schwab’s depository institution subsidiaries to assess the subsidiary’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings (“outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial noncompliance”). The failure of an institution to receive at least a “satisfactory” rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions or opening branch offices.\nSource of Strength\nThe Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve’s long-held position that a depository institution holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary depository institutions, the so-called “source of strength doctrine.” In effect, the holding company may be compelled to commit resources to support the subsidiary in the event the subsidiary is in financial distress.\nBroker-Dealer, FCM, FDM, and Investment Advisor Regulation\nOur principal broker-dealer subsidiaries, CS&Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TDAC, are each registered as a broker-dealer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the fifty states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. CS&Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., CSIM, and certain of our other subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the SEC. CS&Co is also registered as an FCM with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and TD Ameritrade Futures & Forex LLC (TDAFF) is registered as an FCM and FDM with the CFTC.\nMuch of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to SROs. Our principal broker-dealers are each a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). In addition, CS&Co is a member of Nasdaq Stock Market, Cboe EDGX and MEMX and TDAC is a member of NYSE Arca, Nasdaq Stock Market, Cboe EDGX and MEMX. In addition to the SEC, the primary regulators of our principal broker-dealers are FINRA and, for municipal securities, the MSRB. The National Futures Association (NFA) is the primary regulator for CS&Co’s and TDAFF’s futures and commodities trading activities and TDAFF’s forex trading activities.\nThe principal purpose of regulating these entities is the protection of clients and securities markets. The regulations cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, sales and trading practices, publication of research, margin lending, uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, fee arrangements, disclosure to clients, fiduciary duties, and the conduct of directors, officers, and employees.\nOur principal broker-dealer entities are subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule) and related SRO requirements. The CFTC and NFA also impose net capital requirements. The Uniform Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. CSC itself is not a registered broker-dealer and it is not subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule. If CS&Co fails to maintain specified levels of net capital, such failure could constitute a default by CSC of certain debt covenants under its credit agreement.\nThe Uniform Net Capital Rule prohibits broker-dealers from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances or loans or repaying subordinated loans if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement.\nIn addition to net capital requirements, as a self-clearing broker-dealer, CS&Co, and as a clearing broker-dealer, TDAC, are subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements with clearing houses, such as the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and Options Clearing Corporation, which may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients’ trading activity and market volatility.\nAs a result of our operations in countries outside the U.S., we are also subject to rules and regulations issued by certain foreign authorities, including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in Hong Kong, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in Singapore.\n- 11 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nFinancial Services Regulation\nBank Secrecy Act of 1970 and USA PATRIOT Act of 2001\nCSC and its subsidiaries that conduct financial services activities are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which requires financial institutions to develop and implement programs reasonably designed to achieve compliance with these regulations. The BSA and USA PATRIOT Act include a variety of monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as currency transaction reporting and suspicious activity reporting), as well as identity verification and client due diligence requirements which are intended to detect, report and/or prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In addition, CSC and various subsidiaries of the Company are subject to U.S. sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that hiring people who share our corporate purpose of helping clients achieve their financial goals is an essential element of executing our ‘Through Clients’ Eyes’ strategy, and we seek to attract, retain, and motivate the talent Schwab needs to successfully serve our clients and grow our business. As of December 31, 2020, Schwab had full-time, part-time, and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, that represented the equivalent of approximately 32,000 full-time employees.\nSchwab offers a compensation package that rewards both employee and company performance. The package encompasses an array of compensation components in addition to base pay including performance-based incentive pay, equity awards, recognition awards, and a range of health and wellness benefits. We also offer benefits and resources designed to help our employees achieve their financial goals, including a 401(k) plan, an employee stock purchase plan, financial planning consultations, and disability and life insurance options. In addition, Schwab offers programs to help with employee career growth including development and leadership programs as well as reimbursement for qualified business-related education and training. We also encourage and empower employees to volunteer in the communities where we live and work, offering paid time off for every employee to volunteer in his or her community.\nWe know that through workplace diversity, we gain a wider range of perspectives and experiences, which supports our strategy and helps us better serve our clients. We focus on attracting a diversity of talent by maintaining a strong employer brand and expanding where and how we meet prospective employees. We recruit from underrepresented communities through targeted campus recruiting, scholarship programs, and partnerships with professional organizations. We also offer coaching programs for college students from underrepresented communities to help develop career skills and learn about internship and career opportunities at Schwab. For Schwab employees, we support a number of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) which are employee-driven and provide support, leadership development opportunities, and connection to our diverse marketplace. Our ERGs are made up of employees who share characteristics or life experiences and are committed to enhancing diversity and inclusion at Schwab. Additionally, our leaders are explicitly responsible for creating an environment where all people can do their best work, and for fostering the development of high-performance teams that recognize the value of diverse perspectives, skills and backgrounds. We regularly request feedback from our employees through surveys.\nAvailable Information\nSchwab files annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. The SEC filings are available to the public over the internet on the SEC’s website at\nhttps://www.sec.gov\n.\nOn our website,\nhttps://www.aboutschwab.com\n, we post the following filings after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC: annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, the website also includes the Dodd-Frank Act stress test results, our regulatory capital disclosures based on Basel III, and our quarterly average LCR.\nAll such filings are available free of charge either on our website or by request via email (\ninvestor.relations@schwab.com\n), or mail (Charles Schwab Investor Relations at 211 Main Street, San Francisco, CA 94105).\n- 12 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION"

    "text": "We face a variety of risks that may affect our operations, financial results, or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant, although there may be other risks that could arise, or may prove to be more significant than expected, that may affect our operations or financial results.\nFor a discussion of our risk management governance and processes, including operational risk, compliance risk, credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, see Risk Management and Capital Management in Part II, Item 7.\nGeneral Economic and Market Risks\nThe challenging economic environment triggered by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted and will continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe COVID‑19 pandemic has adversely impacted the economic environment, leading to lower interest rates across the curve and heightened volatility in the financial markets. These developments have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our net interest revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue, and asset management and administration fees. Additionally, in March 2020, we experienced a significant increase in client cash balances held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries which caused our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio to decline into the buffer we maintain between our long-term operating objective and our regulatory requirement. This will limit our ability to return excess capital to stockholders, including through share repurchases, until the ratio returns to higher levels.\nCredit markets have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted due to both uncertainty regarding the pandemic’s economic impact and the anticipation that high levels of unemployment will have a significant impact on retail credit and commercial real estate forbearances and delinquencies. We have experienced and may continue to experience higher levels of delinquencies on our portfolios of first mortgages and home equity lines of credit. We also have experienced and may in the future experience material market-driven credit spread movements in certain sectors within our portfolio of investment securities, particularly within our investments in corporate credit securities, asset-backed securities, municipal securities, and commercial mortgage-backed securities.\nCertain of our client service response and processing times have increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients have experienced and continue to occasionally experience delays accessing and using our website and mobile applications. Many of our employees and those of our outsourced service providers are working remotely and this has at times contributed to the increase in response and processing times, particularly when we have experienced the temporary loss of services from some of our outsourced service providers. We consider service quality to be an important part of the client experience and our failure to meet client expectations could result in decreased client satisfaction. The COVID-19 pandemic could make the timely achievement of our TD Ameritrade integration milestones more challenging, particularly with regard to technology and systems.\nThese and other impacts of the COVID‑19 pandemic have had and will likely continue to have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section. The extent to which the COVID‑19 pandemic, or the emergence of another wide-spread health crisis, impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the outbreak, actions taken by governmental authorities to contain the financial and economic impact and the spread of the outbreak, the effect on our clients, employees, and outsourced service providers, further changes in credit quality and spreads, and reactions in the financial markets.\nDevelopments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business.\nOur business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates, and overall investor engagement, and are outside of our control. Deterioration in the housing and credit markets, reduction in interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources.\n- 13 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, have a significant effect on our operating results. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including changes in its target funds rate and balance sheet management, are difficu\nlt to predict and can affect our net interest revenue and bank deposit account fees. These policies could also have implications for clients’ allocation to cash; higher or lower client cash balances have an impact on our capital requirements as well as liquidity implications if such changes in allocation are sudden\n.\nA significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our income.\nWe rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue. Cash awaiting investment in a portion of our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries and those bank deposits are then used to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities. We also sweep a portion of such cash pursuant to the IDA agreement which requires us to maintain a minimum IDA sweep balance. A significant reduction in our clients’ allocation to cash, a change in the allocation of that cash, or a transfer of cash away from the Company, could reduce our income.\nSignificant interest rate changes could affect our profitability.\nThe direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue and our bank deposit account fee revenue. A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues when we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients. The significant reduction in interest rates related to the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a negative impact on our revenue related to interest rates and has caused us to waive management fees for certain funds.\nAlthough we believe we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment, a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits, or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets can reduce our net interest revenue.\nThe announced phase-out of LIBOR could negatively impact our net interest revenue and will continue to require significant operational work.\nCertain securities in our investment portfolio and the floating rate loans we offer reference LIBOR as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount. We also use LIBOR in many of our financial models, such as those used for capital stress testing, and to determine the dividend rates for certain of our series of preferred stock which begin to float in 2022 and later. If LIBOR is discontinued as announced, there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and there will continue to be significant work required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems and financial models. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions and may impact our existing transaction data, products, systems, operations, and pricing processes. The calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue. In addition, LIBOR may perform differently during the phase-out period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio.\nCompliance Risks\nExtensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties\nor limitations on business activities.\nAs a participant in the securities, banking, and financial services industries, we are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and SROs. The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client prote\nction, and market conduct requirements on us as well as restrictions on the activities that we are allowed to conduct. We become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as we grow.\nRegulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy. Regulators could also limit our ability to grow, including adding assets, launching new products, making acquisitions, and undertaking strategic investments. Our banking regulators could require CSC and/or our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital, increase liquidity, or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSC’s ability to repurchase or redeem shares.\n- 14 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension, disqualification or expulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on our business activities, any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.\nLegislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results.\nNew legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, standards of conduct with clients, conflicts of interest, and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts, may directly affect our operations and profitability or our specific business lines. Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions.\nFailure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition.\nCSC, together with its banking, broker-dealer, and FCM/FDM subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of our capital and our internal assessment of our capital needs. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits the ability of our broker-dealer entities to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, capital planning, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including paying dividends, stock repurchases, and redemptions, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on us. In addition, failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 Capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require us to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect our financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.\nIn January 2021, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule, effective with the 2022 CCAR cycle, making large savings and loan holding companies, including CSC, subject to the CCAR process, which requires submission of an annual capital plan. The plan must include a description of all planned capital actions, including dividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-quarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted. The rule also imposes a stress capital buffer requirement, floored at 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, that will replace CSC’s current 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer for our risk-based capital ratios. The stress capital buffer will equal, as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets, the sum of (i) the difference between a firm’s starting common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and the low point under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the firm’s projected four quarters of common stock dividends for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon to risk-weighted assets as projected under CCAR. The imposition of a stress capital buffer requirement could change the way in which our minimum risk-based capital ratios are calculated and make us subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions if we approach our minimum ratios. This could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to stockholders.\n- 15 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nIf CSC reaches $700 billion in total assets or $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity, CSC will become subject to more stringent Category II requirements, including annual stress testing, the advanced approaches framework, and the inability to opt out of including AOCI in regulatory capital calculations. When CSC’s weighted short-term wholesale funding is $75 billion or more over the four most recent quarters, CSC will become subject to the full LCR rule and daily liquidity reporting and the full NSFR rule (which goes into effect July 1, 2021). CSC anticipates exceeding the $75 billion threshold as of March 31, 2021.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings.\nThe financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks. We are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. We are also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.\nLitigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied with us. Claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct. Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g., patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources. If we were found to have infringed on a third-party patent, or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial damages, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services.\nActions brought against us may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, including reputational harm. Even if we are successful in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period, depending on our results for that period. In market downturns and periods of heightened volatility, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased.\nOperational Risk\nSecurity breaches of our systems, or those of our clients or third parties, may subject us to significant liability and damage our reputation.\nOur business involves the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, activists, hackers and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and will continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses, ransomware,\nand denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, employee misconduct.\nGiven the high volume of transactions that we process, the large number of clients, counterparties and third-party service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\nSecurity breaches, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or clients, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be\n- 16 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\ncovered by insurance, actions by our regulators, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.\nWe also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients’ user names, passwords or other personal information to gain access to our clients’ financial accounts. This could occur from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients’ personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters. Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses, litigation, regulatory actions, and reputational damage.\nWe must process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to our systems, linkages with third-party systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. Our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for asset management, capital planning and management, risk management, stress testing and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting key business partners and vendors, and similar events. For example, we and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have, in certain circumstances, made websites, mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time. It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions. Moreover, instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact our reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of our vendors or other third parties.\nWhile we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of our systems, extraordinary trading volumes, such as those that have recently occurred, could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate. For example, certain of our client service response and processing times have increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients have experienced, and continue to occasionally experience, delays accessing our systems during periods when there is an unusually high volume of client activity. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses, decreased client satisfaction, reputational damage, and regulatory inquiries. We are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses, market makers, dealers, and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement. System failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices and cancelled orders, cause substantial losses for us and for our clients, and subject us to claims from our clients for damages, and cause reputational harm.\nOur investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses.\nFund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, compliance with investment restrictions, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to fund shareholders. Failure to properly perform operational tasks, or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions, penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage, liability to clients, and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management.\nIn the management and administration of funds and client accounts, we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Errors in the design, function, or underlying assumptions used in these\n- 17 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nmodels and tools, particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period, could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments, litigation, and/or regulatory fines.\nWe rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions.\nWe rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. These service providers face technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause us to incur losses and could harm our reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties, natural disasters, public health crises, political developments or for any other reason, and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in financial losses to us. As a result of certain stay at home restrictions related to the COVID -19 pandemic, we temporarily lost the services from some of our outsourced service providers which contributed to increased client service response and processing times. Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations.\nWe rely on financial intermediaries to execute and settle client orders.\nWe rely on market makers, dealers, securities exchanges, clearing houses, and other financial intermediaries to execute and settle our clients’ orders. The unwillingness or inability of any of these parties to perform their usual functions coupled with the unavailability of alternative arrangements could result in our clients’ orders not getting executed or settled. This may be due to market volatility, uneconomic trading conditions, capacity constraints, financial constraints, system failures, unanticipated trading halts invoked by securities exchanges, market closures, or other reasons. Our inability to get client orders executed or settled because of the unwillingness or inability of these parties to perform their usual functions could result in client dissatisfaction and reputational harm and expose us to client claims for damages.\nLiquidity Risk\nA significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in us.\nMaintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations, including transaction settlement, custody requirements, and lending commitments, among other liquidity needs. We meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity as well as external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits, may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. A reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in us, which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts, or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including the LCR. In addition, if our broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC, which could reduce CSC’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt, pay dividends on CSC’s preferred stock, or return capital to common stockholders. In addition, CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries.\nFactors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include CS&Co and TDAC having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts, a dramatic increase in our lending activities (including margin, mortgage-related, and personal lending), increased capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes, or a loss of market or client confidence in us resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds. As a member firm of securities and derivatives clearing houses, we are required to deposit cash, stock and/or government securities for margin requirements and to clearing funds. The margin requirements may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients’ trading activity and market volatility. For example, as a result of recent market volatility the National Securities Clearing Corporation increased margin requirements for member firms and we were required to deposit additional funds. Clearing houses could also require additional funds from member firms if a clearing member defaults on its obligations to the clearing house in an amount larger than its own margin and clearing fund deposits.\nWhen available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs, we may seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC, CS&Co, and TDAC maintain committed and uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can\n- 18 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nbe used to sell securities, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.\nCredit Risk\nWe may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures.\nOur businesses are subject to the risk that a client, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our exposure mainly results from margin lending, clients’ options and futures trading, securities lending, mortgage lending, pledged asset lending, our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor.\nWhen clients purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses, especially if there is a lack of liquidity. As a result of our TD Ameritrade acquisition, our\nmargin, options and futures business has materially increased and market liquidity may represent an increased risk.\nWe have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss. The evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of multiple factors. If management determines that a security’s decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss, an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings. Even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss, if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time.\nOur bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and PALs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors, including from the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense, as well as write downs on such loans.\nHeightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss. Examples include:\n•\nLarge positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;\n•\nMortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and\n•\nClient margins, options or futures, pledged assets, and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer, index, or industry.\nWe sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although we have no obligation to do so, we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause us to take significant charges, could reduce our liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements. If we choose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, we could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition of TD Ameritrade\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the TD Ameritrade acquisition, which could adversely affect the value of our stock.\nThe success of our TD Ameritrade acquisition will depend, in significant part, on our ability to realize the anticipated cost\n- 19 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nsavings and other benefits from integrating the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade. Our ability to realize these anticipated cost savings and other benefits is subject to certain risks. If we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined business may not perform as expected and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIt is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Schwab or TD Ameritrade employees, the loss of clients, the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated.\nMost of the integration planning and execution work is currently being done remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The inability to work in-person and on-site with information technology and management oversight could make some of the integration work more challenging, particularly with regard to technology. We will need to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff and rely on a number of critical technology vendors in order to complete the integration work relating to technology platforms and systems within the target timeframe. In addition, we may experience delays in acquiring the technology and infrastructure components needed for the integration due to pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. We also have been experiencing high levels of trading volume which, if sustained, may require us to increase the capacity in our integration technology build-outs. In addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management and other resources may be diverted from integration work to critical day-to-day business operations. We may also encounter challenges integrating TD Ameritrade technologies into Schwab platforms. Any of these factors could make timely achievement of integration milestones more challenging, particularly with regard to technology and systems.\nWe will continue to incur significant integration costs in connection with the TD Ameritrade acquisition.\nWe will continue to incur significant non-recurring costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans with respect to combining the operations of Schwab and TD Ameritrade, including technology-related, workforce and facilities consolidation costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses.\nWe may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees following completion of the acquisition.\nUncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on Schwab and TD Ameritrade employees may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the integration process, as employees of Schwab and TD Ameritrade may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business. If employees of Schwab or TD Ameritrade depart, the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined business may be harmed. Furthermore, we may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of Schwab or TD Ameritrade, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may be adversely affected. In addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees into Schwab.\nThe TD Ameritrade acquisition may not be accretive to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nBased on the anticipated synergies between Schwab and TD Ameritrade, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share in the third year following completion of the merger. However, future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the acquisition being dilutive to our earnings per share, including adverse changes in market conditions, additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition. Any dilution of, reduction in, or delay of any accretion to, our earnings per share could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate.\nOther Business Risks\nPotential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position.\nWe evaluate potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions. Any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The process of\n- 20 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nevaluating, negotiating, effecting, and integrating any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, and might cause the loss of key clients, employees, and business partners. Moreover, integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate operational, financial, and management information systems and management controls, integrate relationships with clients and business partners, and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas. The integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or changes to inconsistent standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, employees, outsourced service providers and vendors. In addition, an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings or require the amortization of a large amount of acquired intangible assets. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition in a timely manner or at all (including without limitation the recent acquisition of TD Ameritrade), and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share (EPS).\nOur acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business, operations or financial condition of the entity or part of an entity being acquired or sold. To the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity or part of an entity, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, our stock price could decline.\nOur industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment with a broad array of competitors from large integrated banks to venture-capital backed private companies. We continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust interest rates on deposits and loans, fees for advisory services, expense ratios on mutual funds and ETFs, trade commission rates, and other pricing and incentives to sustain our competitive position. Increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients, such as reduced commissions, higher deposit rates, reduced mutual fund or ETF expense ratios, or the increased use of incentives, could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.\nThe market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive. At various times, different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market, compelling us to pay more to attract talent. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs.\nWe need to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff to complete the TD Ameritrade integration work within the target timeframe. Demand for skilled technology professionals is high and we may experience delays in hiring the appropriate skilled resources.\nOur stock price has fluctuated historically, and may continue to fluctuate.\nOur stock price can be volatile. Among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following:\n•\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates;\n•\nSpeculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, our competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, expense discipline, strategic transactions, or progress on achieving the expected benefits from our TD Ameritrade acquisition;\n•\nThe announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by us or our competitors;\n•\nIncreases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results; and\n•\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by large stockholders.\nChanges in the stock market generally, or as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, corporate, regulatory, business, and economic factors may also affect our stock price.\n- 21 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nFuture sales of CSC’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock and result in dilution.\nCSC’s certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC’s Board of Directors, among other things, to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval.\nCSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSC’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock.\nOur ongoing relationships with TD Bank and its affiliates could have a negative impact on us.\nAlthough our acquisition of TD Ameritrade was structured such that completion of the merger would not result in CSC either (i) being deemed to be “controlled” by TD Bank (as that term is interpreted by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act or HOLA) or (ii) being deemed to be in “control” of any of TD Bank’s depository institutions, changes in circumstances could trigger presumptions of control under the Federal Reserve’s regulations. This could occur if TD Bank and its affiliates own more than 9.9% of Schwab common stock, as interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the Federal Reserve. While the Stockholder Agreement between CSC and TD Bank prohibits TD Bank and its affiliates from exceeding the 9.9% threshold, it could happen unintentionally. This presumption of control could also be triggered if the revenue generated to either us or to any of the TD Bank depository institutions exceeds a certain percentage. The Stockholder Agreement contains provisions to address such situations.\nUnder the IDA agreement, we are not permitted to reduce the deposit balances swept to the TD Depository Institutions until June 30, 2021 and thereafter only by a set amount during each 12-month period, subject to certain limitations including only moving IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations and maintaining a minimum IDA sweep balance through 2031. The bank deposit account fee revenue that we earn related to the IDA agreement may be less than the net interest revenue that we could have earned if the deposit balances were swept to our banking subsidiaries rather than the TD Depository Institutions. When we are permitted to reduce the IDA balances, we can only move the balances to our banking subsidiaries if we have sufficient capital. In addition, in a low rate environment it is possible that the sweep arrangement fee computation could result in a negative amount that we would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions,\nresulting in us having an expense rather than revenue."

We believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets, as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services, offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement. Data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business. Total net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, EPS, return on average common stockholders’ equity, and the Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio provide broad indicators of Schwab’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Total expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets is a measure of operating efficiency.\nOur consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial condition of TD Ameritrade beginning on October 6, 2020, as discussed below. Results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 are as follows:\n(1)\n2020 includes inflows of $1.6 trillion related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, $79.9 billion related to the acquisition of the assets of USAA-IMCO, $8.5 billion related to the acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder, and an inflow of $10.9 billion from a mutual fund clearing services client. 2019 includes inflows of $11.1 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients. 2018 includes outflows of $93.9 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients.\n(2)\n2020 includes 14.5 million new brokerage accounts related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and 1.1 million new brokerage accounts related to the acquisition of assets from USAA-IMCO.\n(3)\nSee Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.\n(4)\nAdjusted total expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure adjusting total expenses excluding interest.

The impact of COVID-19, along with social and political turmoil, created an unprecedented combination of personal and macroeconomic challenges for our clients, employees, and stockholders. While working through these challenges, we progressed in advancing the Company’s strategic goals to drive scale, monetization, and segmentation in ways that benefit our clients. Among the Company’s key accomplishments in 2020 were the successful completion of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and three other strategic acquisitions, as discussed below.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic’s rapid escalation in early 2020 was accompanied by volatile equity markets and the Federal Reserve’s further easing of monetary policy. As the year progressed, government aid packages and vaccine developments helped settle the markets, with the S&P 500\n®\nerasing its pandemic-related losses to finish up 16% for the year. Throughout 2020, client engagement with the financial markets greatly increased over the prior year, as client trading activity reached record levels. Core net new assets totaled $281.9 billion in 2020, representing our third consecutive year of over $200 billion. Total client assets reached $6.69 trillion spread across 29.6 million brokerage accounts, up 66% and 140%, respectively, from year-end 2019.\nAgainst this backdrop, Schwab’s net income totaled $3.3 billion, down $405 million, or 11% from 2019, while the Company produced diluted EPS of $2.12, representing a decrease of 21% relative to 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS\n(1)\n, which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and related income tax effects, amounted to $2.45 in 2020, down 9% from $2.70 in 2019.\nTotal net revenues reached $11.7 billion for the year, increasing 9% from 2019. During March 2020, the Federal Reserve acted to support the economy by cutting the Fed Funds rate from 1.75% to near zero and announcing significant asset purchase programs. Mortgage refinancing activity subsequently accelerated, and our net interest margin was impacted by both significantly lower interest rates and increased prepayments of mortgage-backed securities held in our investment portfolio. Strong growth in interest-earning assets via client inflows and allocation decisions, as well as our acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO, helped limit the decrease in net interest revenue to 6%, resulting in a full-year 2020 total of $6.1 billion.\nGrowing balances in advisory solutions and a rebound in equity markets in 2020 helped drive an 8% increase in asset management and administration fees, which totaled $3.5 billion in 2020. Record client trading activity and the addition of TD Ameritrade in the fourth quarter contributed to an 88% increase in trading revenue, which reached $1.4 billion for the year, more than offsetting a full-year impact of the commission reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2019. With the TD Ameritrade acquisition, our fourth quarter 2020 results included bank deposit account fee revenue for the first time, which totaled $355 million for the period from October 6, through December 31, 2020.\nTotal expenses excluding interest increased 26% in 2020 to $7.4 billion, which included significant costs related to our acquisitions. With the completion of four acquisitions during the year, acquisition and integration-related costs totaled $442 million in 2020, representing a significant increase from the $26 million incurred in 2019. Amortization of acquired intangible assets also increased, totaling $190 million in 2020 compared with $27 million in 2019. Exclusive of these items\n(1)\n, adjusted total expenses increased 16% from 2019. Return on average common stockholders’ equity was 9% in 2020, down from 19% in 2019. Return on tangible common equity\n(1)\n(ROTCE) was 15% in 2020, down from 21% in 2019. The 2020 decreases in both return on average common stockholders’ equity and ROTCE are due to lower net income as well as significantly higher balances of common equity due to the TDA acquisition and higher AOCI in 2020, driven by unrealized gains in our AFS investment portfolio.\n(1)\nAdjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.\n- 33 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nThroughout 2020, the Company maintained its disciplined approach to capital management, helping sustain significant balance sheet growth. Schwab’s consolidated total assets ended 2020 at $549 billion, representing growth of $255 billion, or 87%, from year-end 2019, reflecting both our organic growth as well as the acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and the assets of USAA-IMCO. Through offerings in April and December, the Company issued preferred stock totaling approximately $5 billion in 2020, bringing total preferred stock to approximately $7.7 billion, or approximately 25% of Tier 1 Capital at December 31, 2020. The Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.3% at December 31, 2020.\nBusiness and Asset Acquisitions\nTD Ameritrade\nEffective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries; and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its FCM and FDM subsidiary. At the time of closing, TD Ameritrade had approximately $1.6 trillion in client assets and approximately 14.5 million brokerage accounts. In exchange for each share of TD Ameritrade common stock, TD Ameritrade stockholders received 1.0837 shares of CSC common stock, except for TD Bank and its affiliates which received a portion in nonvoting common stock. In connection with the transaction, Schwab issued approximately 586 million common shares to TD Ameritrade stockholders consisting of approximately 509 million shares of common stock and 77 million shares of nonvoting common stock. Upon completion of the acquisition, TDA Holding became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC. See Item 8 – Note 3 for more information.\nFor the period of October 6, through December 31, 2020, total net revenues and total expenses excluding interest attributable to TD Ameritrade were approximately $1.7 billion and $943 million, respectively. TD Ameritrade’s primary sources of revenues include trading revenue, bank deposit account fees, net interest revenue, and asset management and administration fees. Bank deposit account fee revenue is primarily earned through the Company’s IDA agreement. TD Ameritrade’s assets and liabilities have been revalued and recorded at their provisional estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition.\nThe integration of TD Ameritrade’s operations is expected to occur over 18 to 36 months from the date of acquisition, and the Company expects to continue to incur significant acquisition and integration-related costs and integration-related capital expenditures throughout the integration process. Such costs have included and are expected to continue to include professional fees, such as legal, advisory, and accounting fees, and compensation and benefits expenses for employees and contractors involved in the integration work, costs for technology enhancements, as well as exit and other related costs incurred to attain anticipated synergies. Such costs include employee compensation and benefits, including severance pay, other termination benefits and retention costs, as well as costs related to facility closures, including accelerated depreciation or impairments of assets in those locations.\nThe Company currently estimates that total acquisition and integration-related costs and capital expenditures related to the integration of TD Ameritrade will be approximately $1.6 billion. The Company is in the early stages of integration, and our estimates of the nature, amounts, and timing of recognition of acquisition and integration-related costs are subject to change based on a number of factors, including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the heightened uncertainty of the current economic environment. More specifically, factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integration-related costs include the level of employee attrition, workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles, changes in the levels of client activity, as well as increased real estate-related exit cost variability due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAcquisition and integration-related costs, which includes related exit costs, for all of our acquisitions completed in 2020 totaled $442 million, and the Company expects to incur a roughly consistent amount in 2021 related primarily to continued work on the integration of TD Ameritrade. While inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s operating costs and continued acquisition and integration-related costs will increase the Company’s total expenses excluding interest in 2021 and going forward, we expect to realize cost synergies through integration. Over the course of the integration, we expect to realize annualized cost synergies of between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, with one-quarter to one-third on an annualized run-rate basis expected by the end of the first year following acquisition. Estimated timing and amounts of synergy realization are subject to change as we progress in the integration.

Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition has added scale to the Company’s operations through the addition of 1.1 million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA’s members through the long-term referral agreement. See Item 8 – Note 3 for more information on the USAA-IMCO acquisition.\nOther\nDuring the second quarter of 2020 the Company completed its acquisition of technology and intellectual property of Motif, a financial technology company. The Motif assets help us build on our existing capabilities and help accelerate our development of thematic and direct index investing for Schwab’s retail investors and RIA clients. On July 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder, which adds established strategies and new separately managed account offerings to our existing fixed income lineup.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nSchwab delivered solid financial results in 2019 while taking significant steps to further enhance our offer to clients and help position the Company to build value for our stakeholders over the long-term. Throughout 2019, investor sentiment reflected a complex market environment that included global trade negotiations and an uncertain domestic economic outlook. The Federal Reserve ended up cutting the federal funds target interest rate three times in 2019, in a reversal of the increases seen in 2018. At the same time, stocks continued to rise, with the S&P 500\n®\nincreasing 29% during 2019. Core net new assets totaled $211.7 billion for 2019, representing an organic growth rate of 7% and our second consecutive year over $200 billion. Clients opened 1.6 million new brokerage accounts in 2019, while active brokerage accounts grew 6% to 12.3 million. Our success in asset gathering combined with strong market returns drove total client assets to reach $4.04 trillion at December 31, 2019, closing the year up 24%.\nCompany actions to benefit clients and build long-term value during 2019 included the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options, which became effective October 7, 2019. The Company also announced two significant acquisitions during 2019. In July 2019, the Company agreed to acquire assets of USAA-IMCO and agreed to enter into a long-term referral agreement. In late November 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TD Ameritrade.\nAgainst the backdrop of the more challenging than expected macroeconomic environment and our own pricing decisions, Schwab’s net income totaled $3.7 billion in 2019, an increase of $197 million, or 6%. Diluted EPS grew to $2.67, representing an increase of 9% from 2018.\nTotal net revenues reached $10.7 billion, up 6% in 2019. Net interest revenue increased 12% in 2019 to $6.5 billion, driven by higher average investment yields and also by an increase in client cash balances held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries. While trading revenue declined 17% to $752 million due to our pricing actions, asset management and administration fees remained essentially flat with 2018 at $3.2 billion, decreasing 1%. Growing enrollment in advice solutions, along with rising balances in other third-party mutual funds, helped to largely offset declines in Mutual Fund OneSource\n®\nand lower sweep money market fund revenue due to transfers of sweep money market funds to our balance sheet in 2018 and early 2019.\nTotal expenses excluding interest increased 5% in 2019 to $5.9 billion, which included $62 million in severance charges associated with a 3% reduction in our workforce and $25 million in costs relating to the announced acquisitions of assets of USAA-IMCO and TD Ameritrade. The Company’s focus on driving efficiency while managing spending in a disciplined manner helped us maintain a ratio of expenses to client assets of 16 bps for 2019. Balancing long-term profitability with reinvesting for growth, we achieved a 45.2% pre-tax profit margin and a 19% return on equity in 2019, representing our second consecutive year of at least 45% and 19%, respectively.\n- 35 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nDisciplined balance sheet management remained core to our strategy as we continued to support business growth and meaningful capital returns across a range of conditions. In early 2019, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 31% to $0.17 per share and authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock; during 2019 we repurchased 55 million shares for $2.2 billion under this authorization. As of December 31, 2019, our balance sheet assets were $294 billion, down 1% from December 31, 2018; our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 7.3% at year-end 2019.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTotal Net Revenues\nTotal net revenues of $11.7 billion and $10.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, represented growth of 9% and 6% from the prior periods. The 2020 increase was due to our acquisition of TD Ameritrade, which contributed approximately $1.7 billion of total net revenues from October 6, through December 31, 2020. Total net revenues increased in 2019 primarily due to growth in net interest revenue.\n(1)\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2019, a change was made to move CTFs from other asset management and administration fees. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change.\n(2)\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.\nN/M Not meaningful. Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.\nNet Interest Revenue\nSchwab’s primary interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; cash and investments segregated; margin loans, which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients; investment securities; and bank loans. Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. Fees earned and expenses incurred on securities lending and borrowing activities are conducted by our broker-dealer subsidiaries using assets held in client brokerage accounts.\nSchwab’s interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, short-term borrowings (e.g., Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, commercial paper), and long-term debt. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include stockholders’ equity, certain client cash balances, and other miscellaneous liabilities.\n- 36 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nSchwab establishes the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. Schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the assets outlined above. We do not use short-term, wholesale borrowings to support our long-term investment activity, but may use such funding, including FHLB advances or commercial paper, for short-term liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding (e.g., for investment purchases) ahead of anticipated balance sheet deposit growth.\nIn order to keep interest-rate sensitivity within established limits, management actively monitors and adjusts interest-rate sensitivity through changes in the balance sheet, primarily by adjusting the composition of our banking subsidiaries’ investment portfolios. As Schwab builds its client base, we attract new client sweep cash, which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth.\nLate in the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds target overnight rate from 1.75% to near zero; on the longer-end of the curve, the 10-year Treasury rate declined by over 120 basis points. Lower interest rates across maturities persisted from the end of the first quarter through the end of 2020, while credit spreads also compressed. Moreover, changes in the economic environment throughout 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic drove significantly higher levels of client cash sweep balances. As these balances rapidly accumulated in the first quarter of 2020, the Company initially placed a substantial amount in excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve, and subsequently deployed a significant amount of this cash build-up throughout 2020. AFS securities purchases in 2020 totaled $202.2 billion. These purchases were made at rates below the average yield on the existing AFS portfolio due to the current low interest rate environment.\nSchwab’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade, effective October 6, 2020, provides additional interest-earning assets and liabilities. For Schwab’s 2020 full-year averages, TD Ameritrade contributed approximately $12.0 billion of average interest-earning assets and $9.6 billion of average interest-bearing liabilities. TD Ameritrade’s interest-earning assets consist primarily of receivables from brokerage clients, cash and investments segregated, cash and cash equivalents, and AFS securities. TD Ameritrade’s interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of payables to brokerage clients and long-term debt. See Item 8 – Note 3 for additional information on the TD Ameritrade acquisition including the provisional fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n- 37 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheets:\n(1)\nAmounts have been calculated based on amortized cost.\n(2)\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company transferred all of its investment securities designated as held to maturity (HTM) to the AFS category, as described in Item 8 – Note 6.\n(3)\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, securities lending revenue has been reclassified from broker-related receivables and other revenue. Securities lending expense has been reclassified from other expense. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.\n(4)\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, broker-related receivables were removed from total interest earning assets and netted against non-interest-bearing funding sources, resulting in an immaterial reduction to total interest-earning assets and total funding sources. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.\n(5)\nInterest revenue or expense was less than $500 thousand in the period or periods presented.\nNet interest revenue decreased $403 million or 6%, in 2020 from 2019, due primarily to lower average investment yields partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Accelerated premium amortization on debt securities in 2020 also contributed to the reduction in net interest revenue, as the decline in long-term interest rates in 2020 resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage-related debt securities. TD Ameritrade contributed approximately $443 million of net interest revenue from October 6, through December 31, 2020.\nAverage interest-earning assets for 2020 were higher by 40%, compared to 2019. This increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily driven by higher client cash balances in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, due to higher client cash allocations and our acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO.\nOur net interest margin decreased to 1.62% in 2020, from 2.41% in 2019. This decrease was driven primarily by lower yields received on interest-earning assets due largely to the Federal Reserve’s 2019 and 2020 interest rate reductions as well as higher premium amortization on mortgage-related debt securities. Due to the low interest rate environment, purchases of investment securities in 2020 were made at rates below the average yield on the existing AFS portfolio, which negatively impacted our net interest margin. The amount of any further net interest margin compression and resulting net interest\n- 38 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nrevenue is dependent on a number of factors, including changes to LIBOR, premium amortization, reinvestment rates, and growth in client cash balances.\nNet interest revenue increased $693 million, or 12%, in 2019 from 2018, due to higher average investment yields and growth in interest earning assets. Our net interest margin improved 12 basis points to 2.41% in 2019 from 2018, driven primarily by higher average yields received on interest-earning assets in 2019 due largely to the net impact of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases in 2018 and decreases in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. The increase in average yields on interest-earning assets was partially offset by higher average interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Portfolio adjustments made in 2019 to hold a higher percentage of fixed-rate, longer duration investments helped to moderate the impact of the declining rate environment on our net interest margin.\nAverage interest-earning assets grew 6% from 2018 to 2019, primarily driven by higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep, as well as higher client cash balances.\nAsset Management and Administration Fees\nAsset management and administration fees include mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. Schwab earns mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. Asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. Proprietary CTFs may, but generally do not, directly participate in securities lending. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data.\nWe also earn asset management fees for advice solutions, which include managed portfolios, specialized strategies, and customized investment advice. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees.\nAsset management and administration fees attributable to TD Ameritrade are primarily earned on client assets invested in money market mutual funds and other mutual funds, as well as advice solutions.\nAsset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity.\n- 39 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe following table presents asset management and administration fees, average client assets, and average fee yields:\n(1)\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2019, a change was made to move CTFs from other balance-based fees. Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change.\n(2)\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, Schwab ETF OneSource\nTM\nwas discontinued as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed ETFs.\n(3)\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, includes third-party money funds related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade.\n(4)\nAverage client assets for advice solutions may also include the asset balances contained in the mutual fund and/or ETF categories listed above.\n(5)\nIncludes various asset-related fees, such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, and mutual fund clearing fees and other service fees.\n(6)\nIncludes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based.\nAsset management and administration fees increased by $264 million, or 8%, in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, overall gains in equity markets, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, in 2020 relative to 2019. These increases were partially offset by the effect of money market fund fee waivers due to declining portfolio yields. Asset management and administration fees attributable to TD Ameritrade were approximately $131 million from October 6, through December 31, 2020. The amount of fee waivers in coming quarters is dependent on a variety of factors, including the level of short-term interest rates and client preferences across our money market fund line-up.\nAsset management and administration fees decreased by $18 million, or 1%, in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to lower sweep money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank and broker-dealer sweep in 2018 and early 2019, as well as client asset allocation choices including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource\n®\n. Part of the decline was offset by revenue from growing asset balances in purchased money market funds, other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, and in advice solutions.\n- 40 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe following table presents a roll forward of client assets for the Schwab money market funds, Schwab equity and bond funds, ETFs, and CTFs, and Mutual Fund OneSource\n®\nand other non-transaction fee (NTF) funds. The following funds generated 40%, 45%, and 48% of the asset management and administration fees earned during 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively:\n(1)\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2019, CTFs are included in these balances. Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change.\nTrading Revenue\nTrading revenue includes commissions, order flow revenue, and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by volume and mix of trades executed. Order flow revenue is comprised of rebate payments received from trade execution venues to which our broker-dealer subsidiaries send equity and option orders. Order flow revenue is affected by volume and mix of client trades, as well as pricing received from trade execution venues. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from our clients and other broker-dealers to accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions.\nThe following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers:\nNote:     Effective October 7, 2019, CS&Co eliminated online trade commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options. TD Ameritrade, Inc. also does not charge for these types of trades and does not have a base charge on options.\n(1)\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.\n(2)\nRevenue per trade is calculated as trading revenue divided by DATs multiplied by the number of trading days.\nN/M   Not meaningful. Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.\nTrading revenue increased $664 million, or 88% in 2020 compared to 2019, due primarily to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, which contributed approximately $667 million of trading revenue from October 6, 2020 forward. In addition, the Company saw a significant increase in clients’ daily average trades and higher order flow revenue in 2020, which were partially offset by the Company’s October 2019 pricing actions. Order flow revenue was $621 million, $135 million, and $139 million during 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The increase in order flow revenue in 2020 was due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and a higher volume of trades throughout 2020 relative to 2019.\nTrading revenue decreased by $150 million, or 17%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options effective October 7, 2019.\nBank Deposit Account Fees\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company began earning bank deposit account fee revenue pursuant to the IDA agreement and arrangements with other third-party banks. Bank deposit account fees are primarily affected by average BDA balances and the floating- and fixed-rate reference yields that are a key component to derive fees pursuant to the IDA\n- 41 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nagreement. Fees earned under the IDA agreement are affected by changes in interest rates and the composition of balances designated as fixed- and floating-rate.\nBank deposit account fees totaled $355 million for the period of October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020. During this period, the total average BDA balance was approximately $161 billion, of which approximately 80% was designated as fixed-rate obligation amounts and approximately 20% as floating-rate obligation amounts.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue includes exchange processing fees, certain service fees, software fees, and non-recurring gains. Other revenue increased $90 million, or 37%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher exchange processing fees resulting from higher trade volumes and the acquisition of TD Ameritrade. Other revenue increased $64 million, or 36%, in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a gain from the sale of a portfolio management and reporting software solution for advisors to Tamarac Inc. in the second quarter of 2019 and a gain from the assignment of leased office space in the first quarter of 2019.\nTotal Expenses Excluding Interest\nThe following table shows a comparison of total expenses excluding interest:\n(1)\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2020, amortization of acquired intangible assets was reclassified from depreciation and amortization. Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change.\nN/M Not meaningful. Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.\nTotal expenses excluding interest increased $1,518 million, or 26%, in 2020 from 2019, and $303 million, or 5%, in 2019 from 2018. In 2020, total expenses excluding interest included approximately $943 million from TD Ameritrade’s results of operations from October 6, through December 31, 2020. Adjusted total expenses, which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased $939 million, or 16%, in 2020 from 2019, and $279 million, or 5%, in 2019 from 2018. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.\n- 42 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nTotal compensation and benefits increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to an overall increase in employee headcount due primarily to the addition of approximately 10,000 TD Ameritrade employees and the hiring of 400 former USAA employees in connection with our 2020 acquisitions. The increase in 2020 also reflected the Company’s payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compensation and benefits in 2020 included $235 million of acquisition and integration-related costs. The increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to both an overall increase in employee headcount to support our expanding client base and higher severance costs, which included $62 million associated with a 3% reduction in our workforce in the third quarter of 2019.\nProfessional services expense increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to acquisition and integration-related costs in 2020 of $158 million. The increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to overall growth in the business, investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale, and certain costs relating to the pending acquisitions completed in 2020.\nOccupancy and equipment expense increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, as well as an increase in technology equipment costs associated with higher client trade volumes and overall growth in the business. The increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to increases in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business.\nCommunications expense increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward and higher news and quotation services expenses due to higher trade volumes.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses grew in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software, higher depreciation and amortization of equipment, office facilities, and property recognized in the TDA acquisition, as well as higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to the expansion of our U.S. campuses in 2019 and 2020. The increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with investments in software and technology enhancements.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets increased in 2020 as a result of the acquisitions completed during the year.\nRegulatory fees and assessments increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, and higher FDIC insurance assessments and other regulatory assessments due to growth in assets and overall growth of the business in 2020. Regulatory fees and assessments decreased in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments resulting from the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nOther expenses increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily resulting from the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, and increases in processing fees and related expenses due to higher client trade volumes and market volatility. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expense in 2020. Other expenses in 2020 included acquisition and integration-related costs of $30 million. Other expenses decreased in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to lower travel and entertainment expense and bad debt expense.\nCapital expenditures were $741 million, $753 million, and $576 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Capital expenditures decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower building expansion in 2020, largely offset by higher capitalized software costs. Capital expenditures increased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to the expansion of our campuses in the U.S. Investments in buildings were $173 million, $397 million, and $253 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capitalized software costs totaled $453 million, $188 million, and $194 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nOur capital expenditures for 2020 equaled 6% of total net revenues, within our estimated range for the year. We will continue to invest in integration-related and other technology projects in 2021, and we anticipate capital expenditures in 2021 to be approximately 6-7% of total net revenues. Our longer term expectation for capital expenditures remains in the range of 3-5% of total net revenues.\nDuring 2020, the Company experienced high levels of client engagement and record trading volumes while nearly all employees were in a remote work environment. Client activity rose sharply in the fourth quarter, and the client service and operational challenges created by this environment became more pronounced. Clients experienced longer call wait times\n- 43 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nalong with a limited number of issues in utilizing our website and mobile applications. In 2021, the Company anticipates increased spending to improve service levels and support our expanding client base, including additional technology spending as well as hiring more client service professionals.\nOverall in 2021, we expect total expenses excluding interest to reflect the impacts of: continued acquisition and integration-related costs primarily related to our integration of TD Ameritrade; increased spending to improve service levels and support growth; and our progress in achieving incremental cost synergies. The magnitude and timing of these impacts are inherently uncertain and depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of client engagement and trading volumes, the pace and levels of employee hiring, onboarding, and attrition, and changes in our needs to exit or maintain office and branch locations.\nTaxes on Income\nSchwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 23.3% in 2020, 23.6% in 2019, and 23.1% in 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to federal and state tax benefits recognized during 2020, including settlement of the IRS examination of tax years 2011-2014, the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain federal and state uncertain tax positions, and tax benefits realized from the filing of state tax returns, as well as an increase in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) benefits. Offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate from these items was an increase in nondeductible acquisition costs and FDIC insurance premium disallowance, as well as a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits. The change in rates in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits which reduced our tax expense by approximately $23 million and $46 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSegment Information\nSchwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. Management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity; differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets, client trading frequency, and pricing unique to each. While both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms, segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in Investor Services versus the thousands of RIAs on the Advisor Services platform.\nThe Company integrated its business and asset acquisitions during 2020 into its two existing reportable segments. Revenues and expenses from our acquisition of USAA-IMCO are allocated to Investor Services only; revenues and expenses from TD Ameritrade and our other 2020 acquisitions are attributed to both Investor Services and Advisor Services based on which segment services the client. See Item 8 – Note 3 for more information regarding acquisitions.\n- 44 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nFinancial information for our segments is presented in the following table:\n(1)\nBeginning in 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.\n(2)\nIn 2020, Investor Services includes inflows of $890.7 billion related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and $79.9 billion related to the acquisition of assets of USAA-IMCO. Additionally, 2020 and 2019 includes inflows of $10.9 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively, and outflows of $93.9 billion in 2018 from certain mutual fund clearing services clients.\n(3)\nIn 2020, Advisor Services includes inflows of $680.6 billion related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and $8.5 billion related to the acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder.\nN/M Not meaningful. Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.\nSegment Net Revenues\nInvestor Services total net revenues increased by 13% in 2020 from 2019, while Advisor Services total net revenues remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Investor Services’ growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, higher asset management and administration fees, and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. For Advisor Services, bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue, while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019. Trading revenue increased significantly in the Investor Services segment primarily due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for Investor Services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets.\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total net revenues increased by 4% and 10%, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, which increased as a result of higher average investment yields and higher interest earning assets. For Investor Services, asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to growing asset balances in advice solutions, partially offset by lower mutual fund and ETF service fee revenue as a result of client cash allocation choices, including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource\n®\n. For Advisor Services, asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower sweep money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank and broker-dealer sweep, as well as client asset allocation choices, including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource\n®\n, partially offset by increased revenue from growing asset balances in purchased money market funds and in other third-party mutual funds and ETFs. Trading revenue decreased for both segments as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nSegment Expenses Excluding Interest\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29% and 17%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s expenses from October 6, 2020 forward and\n- 45 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nacquisition and integration-related costs. Compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of TDA and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base, with Investor Services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the TDA acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition. Both segments also saw increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s expenses from October 6, 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, with Investor Services’ expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment’s client base and greater client base growth from TDA.\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services expenses excluding interest increased 3% and 12%, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and occupancy and equipment expense. Additionally, Advisor Services had higher professional services expense due to overall growth in the business and investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale, and Investor Services had higher amortization of internally developed software due to technology enhancements. For both segments these increases were partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments due to the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower travel and entertainment expenses.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nSchwab’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.\nOur risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.\nAs part of our integration of TD Ameritrade, the Company is aligning TD Ameritrade’s historical risk exposures with Schwab’s risk appetite. Our integration work includes evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company, and may involve modifications to our existing risk management processes. Though integration work continues, the Company’s operations, inclusive of TD Ameritrade, remain consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.\nCulture\nThe Board of Directors has approved an ERM framework that incorporates our purpose, vision, and values, which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization.\nWe designed the ERM Framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by Schwab in its business activities. The framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors.\nRisk Governance\nSenior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks.\nThe Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors.\n- 46 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nWe have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees.\nThe Chief Risk Officer regularly reports activities of the Global Risk Committee to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Board Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of corporate risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit.\nFunctional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:\n•\nOperational Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Information Security, Fraud, Third-Party Risk, Data, and Model Governance;\n•\nCompliance Risk Committee – provides oversight of compliance risk management programs and policies providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure and employee conduct, including subcommittees covering Fiduciary and Conflicts of Interest Risk and International Compliance Risk;\n•\nFinancial Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves credit, market, liquidity, and capital risk policies, limits, and exposures; and\n•\nNew Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to, the risk governance of new products and services.\nSenior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring risk management.\nIn addition, the Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk arises due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people, internal processes, and systems, or from external events or relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and third parties. While operational risk is inherent in all business activities, we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the Company’s risk appetite. We have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and use control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Where appropriate, we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation.\nSchwab’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent Schwab experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), our business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program.\n- 47 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nInformation Security risk is the risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, recording or destruction of the firm’s information or systems. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. We continuously monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We use advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. We limit the number of employees who have access to clients’ personal information and internal authentication measures are enforced to protect against the potential for social engineering. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab’s conduct and cybersecurity teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow us to identify and quickly act on any attempted intrusions.\nFraud risk arises from attempted or actual theft of financial assets or other property of any client or the Company. Schwab is committed to protecting the Company’s and its clients’ assets from fraud, and complying with all applicable laws and regulations to prevent, detect and report fraudulent activity. Schwab manages fraud risk through policies, procedures and controls. We also take affirmative steps to prevent and detect fraud and report, to appropriate authorities, any known or suspected acts of fraud in accordance with existing laws and requirements.\nSchwab also faces operational risk when we employ the services of various third parties, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. We manage the exposure to third party risk and promote a culture of resiliency through contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing monitoring of third party performance, and appropriate testing. We also maintain policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with all data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. We clearly define for employees, contractors, and third parties the expected standards of care for critical and confidential data. We also provide regular training on data security.\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the organization, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. We have established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities.\nIncentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to expose the Company to material amounts of risk.\nCompliance Risk\nSchwab faces compliance risk which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of our controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs.\nWe manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies.\nConduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company’s behalf that may result in detriment to the Company’s clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company’s employees. We manage this risk through a policy, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel\n- 48 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nmonitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Corporate Responsibility Officer.\nFiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments.\nLiquidity and Investment Portfolios\nSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.\nAt December 31, 2020, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.\nMortgage Lending Portfolio\nThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.\nOur residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo).\nSchwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab’s bank loans, see Item 8 – Note 7.\nSecurities and Instrument-Based Lending Portfolios\nCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.\n- 49 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nOther Counterparty Exposures\nSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the Company.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets.\nTo manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company’s risk appetite.\nOur measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue, bank deposit account fees, or economic value of equity (EVE). Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. Financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument.\nWe are indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with Schwab. Additionally, we earn mutual fund and ETF service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn.\nOur market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material.\nInterest Rate Risk Simulations\nNet Interest Revenue Simulation\nFor our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulations include all balance sheet interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans.\nNet interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include investment securities, margin loans, and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.\nNet interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment.\n- 50 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2020 and 2019 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period:\nThe change in sensitivities of net interest revenue as of December 31, 2020 reflects a significantly lower interest rate curve relative to December 31, 2019 due to the global economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher short-term interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources, compressing net interest margin.\nIn addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue.\nEconomic Value of Equity Simulation\nManagement also uses EVE simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions. Our net interest revenue and EVE simulations reflect the assumption of non-negative investment yields.\nBank Deposit Account Fees Simulations\nConsistent with the presentation on our statement of income, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the interest rate sensitivity analysis described above. As of December 31, 2020, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to changes in interest rates is limited, as a significant portion of BDA deposit balances are allocated to fixed-rate obligation amounts.\nExpected Phase-out of LIBOR\nThe Company has established a firm-wide team to address the phasing-out of LIBOR by June 30, 2023. As part of our efforts, we have assessed our LIBOR exposures, the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans. In purchasing new investment securities, we ensure that appropriate fall-back language is in the security’s prospectus in the event that LIBOR is unavailable or deemed unreliable, and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fall-back language. We are updating loan agreements to ensure new LIBOR-based loans adequately provide for an alternative to LIBOR. Furthermore, we plan to phase-out the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in our new lending products before the end of December 2021, per guidance from the Federal Reserve Board. Consistent with our “Through Clients’ Eyes” strategy, our focus throughout the LIBOR transition process is to ensure clients are treated fairly and consistently as this major change is occurring in the financial markets.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.\nDue to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of: CS&Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TDAC, our principal broker-dealer subsidiaries; the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries; principal and interest due on corporate debt; dividend payments on CSC’s preferred stock; and returns of\n- 51 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\ncapital to common stockholders. The liquidity needs of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by the amount of client deposits. In addition, the liquidity needs of our banking subsidiaries can also be met by excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve, sales of investment securities, or FHLB borrowings. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.\nWe employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at certain subsidiaries and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate.\nPrimary Funding Sources\nSchwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients.\nOther sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, bank deposit account fees earned on client deposits placed in third-party depository programs, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing.\nTo meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.\nAdditional Funding Sources\nIn addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The need for short-term borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis.\n- 52 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe following table describes external debt facilities available at December 31, 2020:\n(1)\nAmounts available are dependent on the amount of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral.\n(2)\nAmounts available are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral.\n(3)\nCSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue Commercial Paper Notes not to exceed $1.5 billion. In February 2021, the Company increased the amount available to $1.5 billion.\n(4)\nOther than an overnight borrowing to test availability, this facility was unused during 2020.\n(5)\nEffective October 6, 2020, Schwab entered into a guaranty supplement to guarantee the obligations of TD Ameritrade under this credit agreement. The provision of the guaranty supplement was a condition for certain financial covenant and reporting obligations being modified in the credit agreement. The Company terminated this revolving credit facility effective January 28, 2021.\n(6)\nSecured borrowing is made available based on TDAC’s ability to provide acceptable collateral to the lender as determined by the credit agreement.\nOur banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the FHLB. Amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral. These credit facilities are also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries’ respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans.\nOur banking subsidiaries also have access to short-term secured funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral.\nCSC has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings were P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and CSC had no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nThe financial covenants for the $700 million committed credit facility require CS&Co to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, all bank subsidiaries to be well capitalized, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2020, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $16.5 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, at December 31, 2020 was $50.7 billion). Management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements.\nThe financial covenants for the $300 million TDA Holding revolving credit facility requires CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2020, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $30.9 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, at December 31, 2020 was $50.7 billion). Effective January 28, 2021, the Company terminated the TDA Holding revolving credit facility.\nTo partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, CS&Co has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with several banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation, which totaled $15 million at December 31, 2020. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2020 or 2019. In connection with its securities lending activities, the Company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. These collateral requirements are satisfied by providing cash as collateral.\nCSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities.\n- 53 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio\nPursuant to the 2019 interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, Schwab became subject to a reduced LCR rule requiring the Company to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 85% of the Company’s projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30-calendar-day period of acute liquidity stress, calculated on each business day. See Item 1 – Regulation for additional information. The Company was in compliance with the reduced LCR rule at December 31, 2020. The table below presents information about our average daily LCR:\nBorrowings\nThe Company had no short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. Long-term debt outstanding was $13.6 billion and $7.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Effective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. TDA Holding has $3.6 billion of par value unsecured Senior Notes (TDA Senior Notes) outstanding, which were recognized at the date of acquisition at provisional fair value with no change in existing terms.\nThe following are details of the Senior Notes:\nNew Debt Issuances\nAll debt issuances in 2020, 2019, and 2018 were senior unsecured obligations. Additional details are as follows:\n- 54 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nEquity Issuances and Redemptions\nCSC did not issue any equity through external offerings during 2019 or 2018. CSC’s preferred stock issued and net proceeds for 2020 are as follows:\nFor further discussion of CSC’s long-term debt and information on the equity offerings, see Item 8 – Notes 13 and 19.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSchwab enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, Schwab enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8 – Notes 7, 11, 13, 15, and 17. Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade effective October 6, 2020, the IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions became effective. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, certain brokerage client deposits are required to be swept off-balance sheet to the TD Depository Institutions. TD Ameritrade also maintains agreements pursuant to which client brokerage cash deposits are swept to other third-party depository institutions. See Item 8 – Notes 3 and 15 for additional information on the IDA agreement.\nContractual Obligations\nSchwab’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are shown in the following table. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets that are generally short-term in nature or without contractual payment terms (e.g., bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation). The below table excludes exit and other related liabilities from the integration of TD Ameritrade (see Item 8 – Note 16), as well as obligations related to the IDA agreement (see Item 8 – Note 15).\n(1)\nRepresents CSB’s commitments to extend credit to banking clients, purchase mortgage loans, and fund CRA investments.\n(2)\nIncludes estimated future interest payments through 2031 for Senior Notes. Amounts exclude unamortized discounts and premiums.\n(3)\nConsists of purchase obligations for services such as advertising and marketing, telecommunications, professional services, and hardware- and software-related agreements.\n(4)\nRepresents operating lease payments including legally-binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced.\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nSchwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth inclusive of migration of IDA balances (see further discussion below), providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios.\n- 55 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nInternal guidelines are set, for both CSC and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and Financial Risk Oversight Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. In addition, we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for CS&Co. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.\nSchwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, we have a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company’s capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.\nFor additional information, see Business – Regulation in Part I, Item 1.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nCSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress. Schwab is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%, and we have a long-term operating objective of 6.75%-7.00%. Due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and CSB that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC’s asset growth.\nOur banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Our banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks. Schwab’s principal banking subsidiary, CSB, is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2020, CSB is considered well capitalized.\nAs a result of the significant inflow of client cash in 2020, our Tier 1 Leverage Ratios for CSC and CSB declined from 7.3% and 7.1%, respectively, at year-end 2019 to 6.3% and 5.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Though below our long-term operating objectives, these ratios are well above the regulatory minimum for both CSC and CSB. The pace of our return to the long-term operating objectives over time depends on a number of factors including the overall size of the Company’s balance sheet, earnings, and capital issuances and deployment.\n- 56 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe following table details the capital ratios for CSC consolidated and CSB:\n(1)\nIn the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules adopted in October 2019, Category III banking organizations such as CSC were given the ability to opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and CSC made this opt-out election as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, AOCI is excluded from the amounts and ratios presented as of December 31, 2020. In 2019, CSC and CSB were required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital; the amounts and ratios for December 31, 2019 are presented on this basis. See Business – Regulation in Part I, Item 1 for additional information.\nCSB is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the Federal Reserve and the Texas Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending (TDSML) to declare dividends to CSC. As broker-dealers, CS&Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc., are subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit the broker-dealer subsidiaries from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to CSC and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC if such payment would result in a net capital amount below prescribed thresholds. At December 31, 2020, CS&Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc. were in compliance with their respective net capital requirements.\nIn addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab’s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 8 – Note 23 for additional information on the components of stockholders’ equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries.\nIDA Agreement\nPursuant to the IDA agreement, Schwab will be required to move all uninsured IDA balances out of the IDA sweep program on June 30, 2021. The IDA agreement also provides that, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab will have the option to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances every 12 months to Schwab’s balance sheet, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. The Company’s overall capital management strategy includes supporting migration of the uninsured IDA balances on June 30, 2021 as well as optional IDA balances in future periods as available pursuant to the terms of the IDA agreement. The Company’s ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and the availability of IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. See Item 8 – Note 15 for further information on the IDA agreement.\n- 57 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nDividends\nSince the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 127 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 25 times, resulting in a 21% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, CSC currently targets its common and nonvoting common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.\nThe Board of Directors of the Company declared quarterly cash dividend increases per common share during 2019 and 2020 as shown below:\nThe following table details the CSC cash dividends paid and per share amounts:\n(1)\nDividends paid semi-annually until February 1, 2022 and quarterly thereafter.\n(2)\nDividends paid quarterly.\n(3)\nDividends paid semi-annually until March 1, 2022 and quarterly thereafter.\n(4)\nDividends paid semi-annually beginning on June 1, 2018 until December 1, 2027, and quarterly thereafter.\n(5)\nSeries G Preferred Stock was issued on April 30, 2020. Dividends are paid quarterly, and the first dividend was paid on September 1, 2020.\n(6)\nSeries H Preferred Stock was issued on December 11, 2020. Dividends are paid quarterly beginning on March 1, 2021.\nN/A Not applicable.\nShare Repurchases\nOn January 30, 2019, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock. The authorization does not have an expiration date. There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock under this authorization during the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2019, CSC repurchased 55 million shares of its common stock for $2.2 billion. As of December 31, 2020, $1.8 billion remained on our existing authorization.\nFOREIGN EXPOSURE\nAt December 31, 2020, Schwab had exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries, as well as agencies of foreign governments. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of these holdings totaled $10.1 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $6.7 billion, Germany at $1.2 billion, and Canada at $880 million. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of these holdings totaled $6.4 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $3.1 billion, the Netherlands at $845 million, and Sweden at $684 million. In addition, Schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $2.2 billion and $437 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Outstanding margin loans to foreign residents at December 31, 2020 includes $1.2 billion attributable to the inclusion of TDA balances beginning on October 6, 2020.\n- 58 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nSchwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See Item 8 – Notes 2 and 18 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.\nWhen available, Schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, we use the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, prices are obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. We generally obtain prices from three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. Our primary third-party pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposits; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe consolidated financial statements of Schwab have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Item 8 – Note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in applying these accounting principles.\nWhile the majority of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on Schwab’s financial position and financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIncome Taxes\nSchwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, including federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income. Accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances.\n- 59 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nChanges in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the Company. See Item 8 – Note 22 for more information on the Company’s income taxes.\nLegal and Regulatory Reserves\nReserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. See Item 8 – Note 15 for more information on the Company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe have accounted for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date as we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed. We also use our best estimates to determine the useful lives of the tangible and definite-lived intangible assets, which impact the periods over which depreciation and amortization of those assets are recognized. These best estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward looking views of our businesses, client behavior, and market conditions. In our acquisitions, we have also recognized goodwill at the amount by which the purchase price paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. See Item 8 – Note 3 for more information on our valuation methods and the results of applying the acquisition method of accounting, including the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and, where relevant, the estimated remaining useful lives.\nOur ongoing accounting for goodwill and the tangible and intangible assets acquired requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions as we exercise judgement to evaluate these assets for impairment. Our processes and accounting policies for evaluating impairments are further described in Item 8 – Note 2. One of our reporting units has an immaterial amount of goodwill. The results of the 2020 annual goodwill impairment testing for our other two reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying amounts.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with GAAP, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the Company, and facilitate meaningful comparison of Schwab’s results in the current period to both historic and future results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies.\n- 60 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\nSchwab’s use of non-GAAP measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to GAAP financial measures as described below.\nBeginning in 2021, the Company also uses adjusted diluted EPS and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements. The Compensation Committee of CSC’s Board of Directors maintains discretion in evaluating performance against these criteria.\nThe following tables present reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures:\n(1)\nAcquisition and integration-related costs for 2020 primarily consist of $235 million of compensation and benefits, $158 million of professional services, and $30 million of other expense.

Incorporated in 1986, CSC engages, through its subsidiaries, in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services.\nPrincipal business subsidiaries of CSC include the following:\n•\nCharles Schwab & Co., Inc. (CS&Co), incorporated in 1971, a securities broker-dealer;\n•\nTD Ameritrade, Inc., an introducing securities broker-dealer;\n•\nTD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc. (TDAC), a securities broker-dealer that provides trade execution and clearing services to TD Ameritrade, Inc.;\n•\nCharles Schwab Bank, SSB (CSB), our principal banking entity; and\n•\nCharles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM), the investment advisor for Schwab’s proprietary mutual funds (Schwab Funds\n®\n) and for Schwab’s exchange-traded funds (Schwab ETFs\n™\n).\nSchwab’s securities broker-dealers have over\n400\ndomestic branch offices in\n48\nstates and the District of Columbia, as well as locations in Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Singapore.\nUnless otherwise indicated, the terms “Schwab,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean CSC together with its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include CSC and its subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the accompanying financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates. Certain estimates relate to taxes on income, legal and regulatory reserves, and fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as goodwill recognized, in business combinations.\nEffective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “TD Ameritrade” or “TDA”). TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries; and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its futures commission merchant (FCM) and forex dealer member (FDM) subsidiary. Our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial condition of TD Ameritrade beginning on October 6, 2020. See Note 3 for additional information on our acquisition of TD Ameritrade.\nReclassifications:\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Beginning in 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Beginning in 2020, amortization of acquired intangible assets was reclassified from depreciation and amortization and presented separately in the consolidated statements of income. Beginning in 2020, acquired intangible assets – net was reclassified from other assets and presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect these changes. Corresponding presentation changes have been made to the consolidated statements of cash flows and related notes.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nSchwab evaluates all entities in which it has financial interests for consolidation, except for money market funds, which are specifically excluded from consolidation guidance. When an entity is evaluated for consolidation, Schwab determines whether its interest in the entity constitutes a controlling financial interest under either the variable interest entity (VIE) model or the voting interest entity (VOE) model. In evaluating whether Schwab’s interest in a VIE is a controlling financial interest, we consider whether our involvement in the context of the design, purpose, and risks of the VIE, as well as any involvement of related parties, provides us with (i) the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that are significant to the VIE. If both of these conditions exist, then Schwab would be the primary beneficiary of that VIE and consolidate it. Based upon the assessments for all of our interests in VIEs, there are no\n- 71 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\ncases where the Company is the primary beneficiary; therefore, we are not required to consolidate any VIEs. See Note 11 for further information about VIEs. Schwab consolidates all VOEs in which it has majority-voting interests.\nInvestments in entities in which Schwab does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting when we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions of the entity. Investments in entities for which Schwab does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at cost and adjusted for impairment and observable price changes of the identical or similar investments of the same issuer (adjusted cost method), except for certain investments in qualified affordable housing projects which are accounted for under the proportional amortization method. All equity method, adjusted cost method, and proportional amortization method investments are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue recognition\nNet interest revenue\nNet interest revenue is not within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606,\nRevenue From Contracts With Customers\n(ASC 606), because it is generated from financial instruments covered by various other areas of GAAP. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Our primary interest earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; segregated cash and investments; margin loans; investment securities; and bank loans. Fees earned and incurred on securities borrowing and lending activities, which are conducted by the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries on assets held in client brokerage accounts, are also included in interest revenue and expense.\nAsset management and administration fees\nThe majority of asset management and administration fees are generated through our proprietary and third-party mutual fund and ETF offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. Mutual fund and ETF service fees are charged for investment management, shareholder, and administration services provided to Schwab Funds\n®\nand Schwab ETFs\n™\n, as well as recordkeeping, shareholder, and administration services provided to third-party funds. Advice solutions fees are charged for brokerage and asset management services provided to advice solutions clients. Both mutual fund and ETF service fees and advice solutions fees are earned and recognized over time. Fees are generally based on a percentage of the daily value of assets under management and are collected on a monthly or quarterly basis.\nTrading revenue\nTrading revenue is primarily generated through commissions earned for executing trades for clients in individual equities, options, fixed income securities, and certain third-party mutual funds and ETFs, as well as order flow revenue. In late 2019, Schwab eliminated online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options. Commissions revenue is earned when the trades are executed and collected when the trades are settled. Order flow revenue is comprised of rebate payments received from execution venues to which our broker-dealer subsidiaries send equity and option orders. Order flow revenue is recognized when the trades are executed and is collected on a monthly or quarterly basis.\nBank deposit account fees\nBank deposit account fees consist of revenues resulting from sweep programs offered to certain clients whereby uninvested client cash is swept off-balance sheet to FDIC-insured (up to specified limits) accounts at the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party depository institutions. The Company provides marketing, recordkeeping, and support services related to these sweep programs to the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party depository institutions in exchange for bank deposit account fees. These revenues are based on floating and fixed yields as elected by the Company subject to certain requirements, less interest paid to clients and other applicable fees. Bank deposit account fees are earned and recognized over time and collected on a monthly basis.\n- 72 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nOther revenue\nOther revenue includes exchange processing fees, certain service fees, software fees, and non-recurring gains. Generally, the most significant portion of other revenue is exchange processing fees, which are comprised of fees the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries charge clients to offset the exchange processing fees imposed on us by third-parties. Exchange processing fees are earned and collected when the trade is executed and are recognized gross of amounts remitted to the third-parties, which are included in other expenses.\nUnsatisfied performance obligations\nWe do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations other than those that are subject to an elective practical expedient under ASC 606. The practical expedient applies to and is elected for contracts where we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.\nCash and cash equivalents\nSchwab considers all highly liquid investments that mature in three months or less from the time of acquisition and that are not segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds, deposits with banks, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury securities. Cash and cash equivalents also include balances that our banking subsidiaries maintain at the Federal Reserve.\nCash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes\nPursuant to Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable regulations, Schwab maintains cash or qualified securities in segregated reserve accounts for the exclusive benefit of clients. Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes include resale agreements, which are collateralized by U.S. Government and agency securities. Resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions that are recorded at their contractual amounts plus accrued interest. Under these resale agreements, the Company obtains collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount\nloaned and the interest accrued. Collateral is valued daily by the Company, with additional collateral obtained to ensure full collateralization. Cash and investments segregated also include certificates of deposit and U.S. Government securities. Certificates of deposit and U.S. Government securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings.\nSchwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions under ASC 326,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\n, in estimating an allowance for credit losses for resale agreements. This practical expedient can be applied for financial assets with collateral maintenance provisions requiring the borrower to continually adjust the amount of the collateral securing the financial assets as a result of fair value changes in the collateral. In accordance with the practical expedient, when the Company reasonably expects that borrowers (or counterparties, as applicable) will replenish the collateral as required, there is no expectation of credit losses when the collateral’s fair value is greater than the amortized cost of the financial asset. If the amortized cost exceeds the fair value of collateral, then credit losses are estimated only on the unsecured portion.\nReceivables from brokerage clients\nReceivables from brokerage clients include margin loans to securities brokerage clients and other trading receivables from clients. Margin loans are collateralized by client securities and are carried at the amount receivable, net of an allowance for credit losses. Collateral is required to be maintained at specified minimum levels at all times. The Company monitors margin levels and requires clients to provide additional collateral, or reduce margin positions, to meet minimum collateral requirements if the fair value of the collateral changes. Schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for margin loans. An allowance for credit losses on unsecured or partially secured receivables from brokerage clients is estimated based on the aging of those receivables. Unsecured balances due to confirmed fraud are reserved immediately. The Company’s policy is to charge off any delinquent margin loans, including the accrued interest on such loans, no later than at 90 days past due. Accrued interest charged off is recognized as credit loss expense and is included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Clients with margin loans have agreed to allow Schwab to pledge collateralized securities in accordance with federal regulations. The collateral is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for credit losses for receivables from brokerage clients and related activity were immaterial for all periods presented.\n- 73 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nOther securities owned at fair value\nOther securities owned are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. Unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings.\nAFS investment securities\nAFS investment securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses, other than losses related to credit factors, are reported, net of taxes, in AOCI included in stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses from sales of AFS investment securities are determined using the specific-identification method and are included in other revenue. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method based on the contractual terms of the security. Where applicable, prepayments are accounted for as they occur (i.e., prepayments are not estimated).\nAn AFS investment security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Management evaluates AFS investment securities with unrealized losses to determine whether the security impairment has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. This evaluation is performed quarterly on an individual security basis.\nThe evaluation of whether credit loss exists is inherently judgmental. This evaluation considers multiple factors including: the financial condition of the issuer; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; our internal credit ratings; the security’s market implied credit spread; for asset-backed securities, the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit losses on the underlying collateral; recent events specific to the issuer and the issuer’s industry; and whether all scheduled principal and interest payments have been received.\nIf management determines that the impairment of an AFS investment security (or a portion of the impairment) is related to credit losses, an allowance for credit losses is recorded for that security through a charge to earnings. The allowance for credit losses is measured as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of expected cash flows and is limited to the difference between amortized cost and the fair value of the security. The Company estimates credit losses on a discounted cash flow basis using the security’s effective interest rate. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded through earnings in the period of the change.\nIf it is determined that the Company intends to sell the impaired security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before any anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis, any allowance for credit losses of that security will be written off and the amortized cost basis of the security will be written down to fair value with any incremental impairment recorded through earnings.\nThe Company excludes accrued interest from the fair value and the amortized cost basis of the AFS investment securities for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment of the securities. AFS investment securities are placed on nonaccrual status on a timely basis and any accrued interest receivable is reversed through interest income.\nSecurities borrowed and securities loaned\nSecurities borrowed transactions require Schwab to deliver cash to the lender in exchange for securities; the receivables from these transactions are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. For securities loaned, Schwab receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount equal to or greater than the market value of securities loaned; the payables from these transactions are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The market value of securities borrowed and loaned is monitored and collateral is adjusted to ensure full collateralization. Fees received or paid are recorded in interest revenue or interest expense. Schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for securities borrowed receivables.\nBank loans and related allowance for loan losses\nBank loans held for investments are recorded at amortized cost, which is comprised of the contractual principal amounts adjusted for unamortized direct origination costs or net purchase discounts or premiums. Direct origination costs and premiums and discounts are recognized in interest revenue using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan and are adjusted for actual prepayments. Additionally, management estimates an allowance for credit losses, which is\n- 74 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\ndeducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to arrive at the amount expected to be collected. The bank loan portfolio includes\nthree\nportfolio segments: residential real estate, PALs, and other loans. We use these segments when developing and documenting our methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses. The residential real estate portfolio segment is divided into\ntwo\nclasses of financing receivables for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit risk: First Mortgages and HELOCs.\nSchwab records an allowance for credit losses through a charge to earnings based on our estimate of current expected credit losses for the existing portfolio. We review the allowance for credit losses quarterly, taking into consideration current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, the composition of the existing loan portfolio, past loss experience, and any other risks inherent in the portfolio to ensure that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at an appropriate level.\nPALs are collateralized by marketable securities with liquid markets. Credit lines are over-collateralized and borrowers are required to maintain collateral at specified levels at all times. The required collateral levels are determined based on the type of security pledged. Additionally, collateral market value is monitored on a daily basis and a borrower’s credit line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels. As such, the credit loss inherent within this portfolio is limited. Schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for PALs.\nThe methodology to establish an allowance for credit losses for the residential real estate portfolio segment utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and expected losses for this portfolio segment based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segment. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the classes of financing receivables, including loan products within those classes, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral.\nExpected credit losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio (Estimated Current LTV) of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury and LIBOR rates, and borrower FICO scores. The more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, interest rates, and the unemployment rate. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from our historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information, which includes current and forecasted conditions. Loss severity (i.e., loss given default) estimates are based on our historical loss experience and market trends, both current and forecasted. The loss severity estimate used in the allowance for credit loss methodology for HELOCs is higher than that used in the methodology for First Mortgages. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. The unemployment rate forecast is typically based on the recent consensus of regularly published economic surveys. Linear interpolation is applied to revert to long-term trends after the reasonable and supportable forecast period.\nThe methodology described above results in loss factors that are applied to the amortized cost basis of loans, exclusive of accrued interest receivable, to determine the allowance for credit losses for First Mortgages and HELOCs.\nManagement also estimates a liability for expected credit losses on the Company’s commitments to extend credit related to unused HELOCs and commitments to purchase first mortgages. See Note 15 for additional information on these commitments. The liability is calculated by applying the loss factors described above to the commitments expected to be funded and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The liability for expected credit losses on these commitments and related activity were immaterial for all periods presented.\nSchwab considers loan modifications in which it makes an economic concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to be troubled debt restructurings (TDRs).\nNonaccrual, nonperforming and impaired loans\nFirst Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs, and other loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming 90 days past due as to interest or principal (unless the loans are well-secured and in the process of collection), or when the full timely collection of\n- 75 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\ninterest or principal becomes uncertain, including loans to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy. HELOC loans secured by a second lien are placed on non-accrual status if the associated first lien is 90 days or more delinquent, regardless of the payment status of the HELOC. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual status. Generally, a nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal is repaid and the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful. Loans on nonaccrual status and other real estate owned are considered nonperforming assets.\nLoan charge-offs\nThe Company charges off a loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the allowance for credit losses and the loan balance. Our charge-off policy for First Mortgage and HELOC loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or has been discharged in bankruptcy proceedings, regardless of whether the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated costs to sell. The Company’s policy for PALs is to charge off any delinquent loans no later than at 90 days past due.\nEquipment, office facilities, and property\nEquipment, office facilities, and property are recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, except for land, which is recorded at cost. Equipment, office facilities, and property include certain capitalized costs of acquired or internally developed software. Costs for internally developed software are capitalized when the costs relate to development of approved projects for our internal needs that result in additional functionality. Costs related to preliminary project and post-project activities are expensed as incurred. Equipment, office facilities, and property (other than land) are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nEstimated useful lives are as follows:\n(1)\nAmortized over contractual term if less than\nthree years\n.\nEquipment, office facilities, and property are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or whenever indications of impairment exist. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess, with the maximum charge limited to the carrying value of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Our annual impairment testing date is April 1\nst\n. Schwab can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. A qualitative assessment considers macroeconomic and other industry-specific factors, such as trends in short-term and long-term interest rates and the ability to access capital, and Company specific factors such as market capitalization in excess of net assets, trends in revenue generating activities, and merger or acquisition activity.\nIf the Company elects to bypass qualitatively assessing goodwill, or it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, management estimates the fair values of each of the Company’s reporting units (defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compares it to their carrying values. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are established using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit, a market approach which compares each reporting unit to comparable companies in their respective industries, as well as a market capitalization analysis.\n- 76 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nIntangible assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives in a manner that best reflects their economic benefit. All intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.\nLow-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments\nWe account for investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if the applicable requirements are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of taxes on income. The carrying value of LIHTC investments is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Unfunded commitments related to LIHTC investments are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLeases\nThe Company has operating leases for corporate offices, branch locations, and server equipment and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has also elected to not record leases acquired in a business combination on the balance sheet if the remaining term as of the acquisition date is 12 months or less. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease liability may include payments that depend on a rate or index (such as the Consumer Price Index), measured using the rate or index at the commencement date. Payments that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date are considered variable. These payments are not recognized as part of the lease liability and are expensed in the period incurred. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. For the majority of our leases (real estate leases), the Company has elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We have not elected the practical expedient for equipment leases and account for lease and non-lease components separately for those classes of leases.\nAs the rates implicit in our leases are not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include periods covered by options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. The lease terms may also include periods covered by options to terminate when it is reasonably certain that we will not exercise that option.\nLease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nAdvertising and market development\nAdvertising and market development activities include the cost to produce and distribute marketing campaigns as well as client incentives and discounts. Such costs are generally expensed when incurred.\nIncome taxes\nSchwab provides for income taxes on all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are adjusted to reflect the tax rates at which future taxable amounts will likely be settled or realized. The effects of tax rate changes on future deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as well as other changes in income tax laws, are recorded in earnings in the period such changes are enacted. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated to determine whether they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. When tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination the difference between positions taken on tax return filings and estimated potential tax settlement outcomes are recognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. If a position is not more likely than not to be\n- 77 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nsustained, then none of the tax benefit is recognized in Schwab’s financial statements. Accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in taxes on income. Schwab records amounts within AOCI net of taxes. Income tax effects are released from AOCI using the specific-identification method.\nShare-based compensation\nShare-based compensation includes employee and board of director stock options and restricted stock units. Schwab measures compensation expense for these share-based payment arrangements based on their estimated fair values as of the grant date. The fair value of the share-based award is recognized over the service period as share-based compensation. Share-based compensation expense is based on options or units expected to vest and therefore is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Per the Company’s accounting policy election, forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and reviewed annually based on the Company’s historical forfeiture experience. Share-based compensation expense is adjusted in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures. The excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units are recorded in taxes on income.\nFair values of assets and liabilities\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement accounting guidance describes the fair value hierarchy for disclosing assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on the inputs used to value them. The fair value hierarchy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are based on market pricing data obtained from third-party sources independent of the Company. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is generally used to measure fair value whenever available.\nUnobservable inputs reflect management’s judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Where inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or liability are from different levels of the hierarchy, the asset or liability is categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment. The fair value hierarchy includes three levels based on the objectivity of the inputs as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets as of the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.\n•\nLevel 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, new issue data, and collateral performance.\n•\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nSchwab’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include: certain cash equivalents, certain investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, AFS securities, and certain other assets. The Company uses the market approach to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities. When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. We generally obtain prices from three independent third-party pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value.\nOur primary independent pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposits; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices\n- 78 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nare based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded.\nNew Accounting Standards\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\n- 79 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nThere are no new accounting standards not yet adopted that are material to the Company as of December 31, 2020.\n3.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nTD Ameritrade\nOn October 6, 2020 Schwab completed its previously announced acquisition of TD Ameritrade. As a result of the acquisition, TDA Holding became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC. TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries, and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its FCM and FDM subsidiary. TD Ameritrade also provides cash sweep and deposit account products through the IDA agreement, as well as bank deposit account sweep agreements with other third-party depository institutions. The Company anticipates this transaction will add scale to help support the Company’s ongoing efforts to enhance the client experience, provide deeper resources for individual investors as well as RIAs, and continue to improve its operating\n- 80 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nefficiency.\nIn exchange for each share of TD Ameritrade common stock, TD Ameritrade stockholders received\n1.0837\nshares of CSC common stock, except for TD Bank and its affiliates which received a portion in nonvoting common stock. In connection with the transaction, Schwab issued approximately\n586\nmillion common shares to TD Ameritrade stockholders consisting of approximately\n509\nmillion shares of common stock and approximately\n77\nmillion shares of nonvoting common stock, as described below. For further details on the new class of nonvoting common stock, see Note 19.\nInformation regarding the acquisition is provisional and based on information that was available in the limited time since October 6, 2020. Due to the timing of the close of the acquisition, the information described below will be finalized in subsequent periods as prescribed in ASC 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n.\nThe fair value of the purchase price transferred upon completion of the acquisition included the fair value of CSC common stock and nonvoting common stock that was issued to TD Ameritrade stockholders, as well as the fair value of assumed TD Ameritrade equity awards attributable to pre-combination services.\nThe provisional purchase price was calculated as follows:\n(1)\nShare-based awards held by TD Ameritrade employees prior to the acquisition date were assumed by Schwab and converted into share-based awards with respect to CSC common stock, after giving effect to the exchange ratio of\n1.0837\n. Such share-based awards are otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately before the merger, except for performance-based restricted stock units which were converted into time-based restricted stock units. The portion of the fair value of the share-based awards that relates to services performed by the employees prior to the acquisition date is included in the purchase price.\nThe Company accounted for the TD Ameritrade acquisition as a business combination under GAAP and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for certain exceptions to the recognition principle of acquisition accounting, such as leases, share-based payments, and income taxes, as of the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are considered provisional and are based on currently available information. The Company believes that the information available provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; however, these provisional estimates may be adjusted upon the availability of new information regarding facts and circumstances which existed at the acquisition date. The Company expects to finalize the valuation of assets and liabilities as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Any adjustments to the initial estimates of the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed will be recorded as adjustments to the respective assets and liabilities, with the residual amounts allocated to goodwill.\n- 81 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe following table summarizes provisional information including the purchase price, fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and resulting goodwill as of the October 6, 2020 acquisition date.\nThe provisional identifiable tangible and intangible assets of $\n470\nmillion and $\n8.9\nbillion, respectively, are subject to depreciation and amortization.\nThe following table summarizes the major classes of tangible and intangible assets and their respective estimated fair values and weighted-average useful lives:\n(1)\nConsists primarily of buildings.\n(2)\nConsists primarily of equipment and leasehold improvements.\nN/A Not applicable.\nThe estimated fair values of real property, personal property, construction in progress, and land were determined using a sales comparison and cost approach, including consideration of functional and economic obsolescence. The Company estimated the weighted-average useful lives of the assets based on the current condition and expected future use of the assets. The estimated fair values of client relationships, existing technology, and trade names were estimated using a multi-period excess earnings approach, cost approach, and relief from royalty approach, respectively. The multi-period excess earnings method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the asset, and the relief from royalty method starts with a forecast of the royalties saved by the Company because it owns the asset. The forecasts are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the cash flow streams. The cost approach uses replacement cost as an indicator of fair value.\n- 82 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nGoodwill of $\n10.2\nbillion is primarily attributable to the scale, skill sets, operations, and synergies that can be leveraged to enable the combined company to build a stronger enterprise and will not be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill assigned to the Investor Services and Advisor Services segments were $\n6.4\nbillion and $\n3.8\nbillion, respectively.\nThe Company’s consolidated statements of income include total net revenues and net income attributable to the TD Ameritrade acquisition of $\n1.7\nbillion and $\n583\nmillion, respectively, for the period October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020.\nIn connection with the TD Ameritrade acquisition, the Company incurred various professional fees and other costs such as advisory, legal, and accounting fees. In total, the Company incurred acquisition costs of $\n56\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are primarily included in professional services on the consolidated statements of income.\nPro Forma Financial Information (Unaudited)\nThe following table presents unaudited pro forma financial information as if the TD Ameritrade acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma results reflect after-tax adjustments for acquisition costs, amortization and depreciation of acquired intangible and tangible assets, the impact of the amended IDA agreement which reduced the service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions to\n15\nbasis points from the\n25\nbasis points paid by TD Ameritrade under its previous IDA agreement, and other immaterial adjustments for the effects of purchase accounting, and do not reflect potential revenue growth or cost savings that may be realized as a result of the acquisition. Pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 excludes after-tax acquisition costs for both Schwab and TD Ameritrade of $\n115\nmillion. These costs and after-tax acquisition costs of $\n30\nmillion incurred in 2019 by Schwab and TD Ameritrade are included in pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only, and is not necessarily indicative of future operations or results had the TD Ameritrade acquisition been completed as of January 1, 2019.\nUSAA-IMCO\nOn May 26, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the assets of USAA-IMCO for $\n1.6\nbillion in cash. Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition has added scale to the Company’s operations through the addition of over\none\nmillion brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $\n80\nbillion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA’s members through the long-term referral agreement.\nThe Company accounted for the USAA-IMCO acquisition as a business combination under GAAP and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we made a $\n43\nmillion post-closing adjustment to the purchase price resulting in reductions of $\n9\nmillion and $\n34\nmillion to our initial estimates of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired and goodwill, respectively. The Company finalized the valuation of assets and liabilities during the three months ended December 31, 2020, resulting in no additional adjustments to the estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition.\n- 83 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe following table summarizes the purchase price, fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and resulting goodwill as of the May 26, 2020 acquisition date, adjusted for the post-closing adjustments described above.\nThe identifiable intangible assets of $\n1.1\nbillion are subject to amortization.\nThe following table summarizes the major classes of intangible assets acquired and their respective estimated fair values and weighted-average useful lives.\n(1)\nThe brokerage referral agreement has an initial term of\n5\nyears and is automatically renewable for\none\n-year increments thereafter.\nThe estimated fair values of client relationships, the brokerage referral agreement, and the royalty-free license were estimated using the multi-period excess earnings, with-and-without, and relief from royalty methods, respectively. The multi-period excess earnings method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the asset, and the relief from royalty method starts with a forecast of the royalties saved by the Company because it owns the asset. The with-and-without method quantifies the difference between forecasted cash flows with the asset and without the asset. The forecasts are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the cash flow streams.\nGoodwill recorded of $\n472\nmillion, primarily attributable to the additional scale and anticipated synergies from the USAA-IMCO acquisition, was assigned to the Investor Services segment and is deductible for tax purposes.\nThe Company’s consolidated statements of income include total net revenues and net loss attributable to the USAA-IMCO acquisition of $\n235\nmillion and $\n51\nmillion, respectively, for the period May 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020.\nIn connection with the acquisition, the Company agreed to reimburse USAA for certain contract termination and other fees and severance costs incurred by USAA. These costs totaled $\n21\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and are included in other expense on the consolidated statements of income. Additionally, the Company incurred various professional fees and other costs related to the USAA-IMCO acquisition, such as advisory, legal, and accounting fees. In total, the Company incurred acquisition costs of $\n54\nmillion and $\n14\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are primarily included in professional services, other expense, and compensation and benefits on the consolidated statements of income.\nPro Forma Financial Information (Unaudited)\nThe following table presents unaudited pro forma financial information as if the USAA-IMCO acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma results reflect after-tax adjustments for acquisition costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, and do not reflect potential revenue growth or cost savings that may be realized as a result of the acquisition. Pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 excludes after-tax acquisition costs of $\n41\nmillion. These costs, and after-tax acquisition costs of $\n10\nmillion incurred in 2019, are included in pro forma net income for the year\n- 84 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nended December 31, 2019.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only, and is not necessarily indicative of future operations or results had the USAA-IMCO acquisition been completed as of January 1, 2019.\n- 85 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n4.\nRevenue Recognition\nDisaggregated Revenue\nDisaggregation of Schwab’s revenue by major source is as follows:\n(1)\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2019, a change was made to move CTFs from other asset management and administration fees. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change.\n(2)\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change.\nFor a summary of revenue provided by our reportable segments, see Note 24. The recognition of revenue is not impacted by the operating segment in which revenue is generated.\nContract balances\nReceivables from contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606 were $\n579\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and $\n356\nmillion at December 31, 2019 and were recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Schwab does not have any other significant contract assets or contract liability balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n- 86 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n5.\nReceivables from and Payables to Brokerage Clients\nReceivables from and payables to brokerage clients are detailed below:\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately\n17\n% of total CS&Co and TD Ameritrade, Inc. client accounts were located in California. At December 31, 2019, approximately\n22\n% of CS&Co’s total client accounts were located in California.\n- 87 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n6.\nInvestment Securities\nThe amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of the Company’s investment securities are as follows:\n(1)\nApproximately\n51\n% and\n43\n% of asset-backed securities held as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were Federal Family Education Loan Program Asset-Backed Securities. Asset-backed securities collateralized by credit card receivables represented approximately\n36\n% and\n42\n% of the asset-backed securities held as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2)\nAs of December 31, 2020 approximately\n46\n% of the total AFS, and as of December 31, 2019, approximately\n32\n%, of the total AFS and HTM investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper were issued by institutions in the financial services industry.\n(3)\nIncluded in cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets, but excluded from this table is $\n2.5\nbillion of AFS commercial paper as of December 31, 2019 (\nno\nne as of December 31, 2020). These holdings have maturities of three months or less and an aggregate market value equal to amortized cost.\nOn January 1, 2019 the Company transferred certain U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $\n8.8\nbillion from the HTM category to the AFS category as permitted by ASU 2017-12, “\nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities”\n(ASU 2017-12). This transfer resulted in a net of tax increase to AOCI of $\n19\nmillion.\nIn October 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a final enhanced prudential standards rule, and the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC jointly issued a final regulatory capital and liquidity rule. With total consolidated assets of $\n294.0\nbillion at December 31, 2019, CSC is designated as a Category III firm pursuant to the framework established by the final rules. Accordingly, the Company opted to exclude AOCI from its regulatory capital as\n- 88 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\npermitted by the regulatory capital and liquidity rule beginning January 1, 2020. In accordance with ASC 320,\nInvestment\n–\nDebt Securities\nand as of January 1, 2020, the Company transferred all of its investment securities designated as HTM to the AFS category without tainting our intent to hold other debt securities to maturity. At the date of transfer, these securities had a total amortized cost of $\n134.7\nbillion and a total net unrealized gain of $\n1.4\nbillion.\nAt December 31, 2020, our banking subsidiaries had pledged securities with a fair value of $\n44.7\nbillion as collateral to secure borrowing capacity on secured credit facilities with the FHLB (see Note 13). Our banking subsidiaries also pledge investment securities as collateral to secure borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window, and had pledged securities with a fair value of $\n7.9\nbillion as collateral for this facility at December 31, 2020. The Company also pledges securities issued by federal agencies to secure certain trust deposits. The fair value of these pledged securities was $\n1.2\nbillion at December 31, 2020.\nSecurities with unrealized losses, aggregated by category and period of continuous unrealized loss, are as follows:\nAt December 31, 2020, substantially all rated securities in the investment portfolios were investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.\nFor a description of management’s quarterly evaluation of AFS securities in unrealized loss positions see Note 2.\nNo\namounts were recognized as credit loss expense and\nno\nsecurities were written down to fair value through earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNone\nof the Company’s AFS securities held as of December 31, 2020 had an allowance for credit losses.\nNo\namounts were recognized as OTTI in earnings or other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, Schwab did not hold any securities on which OTTI was previously recognized.\nThe Company had $\n634\nmillion of accrued interest receivable as of December 31, 2020 for AFS securities, and $\n471\nmillion of accrued interest receivable for AFS and HTM securities as of December 31, 2019. These amounts are excluded from the amortized cost basis of AFS and HTM securities and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. There were\nno\nwrite-offs of accrued interest receivable on AFS securities during the year ended December 31, 2020, and\nno\nwrite-offs of accrued interest receivable on AFS securities or HTM securities during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n- 89 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nIn the table below, mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities have been allocated to maturity groupings based on final contractual maturities. As borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations underlying our investment securities, actual maturities may differ from the scheduled contractual maturities presented below.\nThe maturities of AFS securities are as follows:\n(1)\nThe weighted-average yield is computed using the amortized cost at December 31, 2020.\nProceeds and gross realized gains and losses from sales of AFS securities are as follows:\n- 90 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n7.\nBank Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe composition of bank loans and delinquency analysis by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable is as follows:\n(1)\nFirst Mortgages and HELOCs include unamortized premiums and discounts and direct origination costs of $\n72\nmillion and $\n74\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2)\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019,\n45\n% of the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios were concentrated in California. These loans have performed in a manner consistent with the portfolio as a whole.\n(3)\nThere were\nno\nloans accruing interest that were contractually 90 days or more past due at December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nAt December 31, 2020, CSB had pledged the full balance of First Mortgages and HELOCs pursuant to a blanket lien status collateral arrangement to secure borrowing capacity on a secured credit facility with the FHLB (see Note 13).\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses on bank loans were as follows:\nNote: Substantially all of the bank loans were collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n(1)\nAll PALs were fully collateralized by securities with fair values in excess of borrowings as of each period presented.\nDespite the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and the continued uncertainty of the economic outlook, credit quality metrics and overall performance of the bank loan portfolios remained strong in 2020. The ACL increased from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, primarily due to growth in mortgage loan origination during the year, driven by the continued low interest rate environment, and also reflects management’s consideration of qualitative factors associated with the potential persistence and effects of COVID-19 on the economic recovery. At December 31, 2020, management’s reasonable and supportable forecast period extends through 2024, with limited growth in home prices anticipated over the near term and unemployment expected to remain above 5% through the end of 2022.\n- 91 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nA summary of bank loan-related nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings is as follows:\n(1)\nNonaccrual loans include nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings.\n(2)\nIncluded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCredit Quality\nIn addition to monitoring delinquency, Schwab monitors the credit quality of First Mortgages and HELOCs by stratifying the portfolios by the following:\n•\nYear of origination;\n•\nBorrower FICO scores at origination (Origination FICO);\n•\nUpdated borrower FICO scores (Updated FICO);\n•\nLoan-to-value (LTV) ratios at origination (Origination LTV); and\n•\nEstimated Current LTV ratios.\nBorrowers’ FICO scores are provided by an independent third-party credit reporting service and updated quarterly. The Origination LTV and Estimated Current LTV for a HELOC include any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the HELOC’s origination. The Estimated Current LTV for each loan is updated on a monthly basis by reference to a home price appreciation index.\n- 92 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe credit quality indicators of the Company’s bank loan portfolio are detailed below:\n(1)\nRepresents the LTV for the full line of credit (drawn and undrawn) for revolving HELOCs.\n(1)\nRepresents the LTV for the full line of credit (drawn and undrawn).\n- 93 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n(1)\nRepresents the LTV for the full line of credit (drawn and undrawn) for revolving HELOCs.\n(1)\nRepresents the LTV for the full line of credit (drawn and undrawn).\nAt December 31, 2020, First Mortgage loans of $\n12.9\nbillion had adjustable interest rates. Substantially all of these mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for\nthree\nto\nten years\nand interest rates that adjust annually thereafter. Approximately\n26\n% of the balance of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately\n77\n% of the balance of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for\nthree\nor more years. Schwab’s mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, Schwab had $\n43\nmillion and $\n46\nmillion, respectively, of accrued interest on bank loans, which is excluded from the amortized cost basis of bank loans and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n- 94 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe HELOC product has a\n30\n-year loan term with an initial draw period of\nten years\nfrom the date of origination. After the initial draw period, the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a\n20\n-year amortizing loan. The interest rate during the initial draw period and the\n20\n-year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin.\nThe following table presents HELOCs converted to amortizing loans during each period presented:\nThe following table presents when current outstanding HELOCs will convert to amortizing loans:\nAt December 31, 2020, $\n664\nmillion of the HELOC portfolio was secured by second liens on the associated properties. Second lien mortgage loans typically possess a higher degree of credit risk given the subordination to the first lien holder in the event of default. In addition to the credit monitoring activities described previously, Schwab also monitors credit risk by reviewing the delinquency status of the first lien loan on the associated property. At December 31, 2020, the borrowers on approximately\n52\n% of HELOC loan balances outstanding only paid the minimum amount due.\n8.\nEquipment, Office Facilities, and Property\nEquipment, office facilities, and property are detailed below:\n(1)\nThe Company assumed the estimated fair value of TD Ameritrade’s equipment, office facilities and property as of the date acquisition on October 6, 2020. See Note 3.\n- 95 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n9.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets and goodwill are detailed below:\nEstimated future annual amortization expense for acquired intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nNote: The above schedule excludes indefinite-lived intangible assets of $\n77\nmillion.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, as allocated to our reportable segments, are presented in the following table:\nSee Note 3 for additional information on the Company’s acquisitions.\nAs of our annual testing date, we performed an assessment of each of the Company’s reporting units. Based on this analysis we concluded that goodwill was not impaired. There were no indicators that goodwill was impaired after our annual testing date. Schwab did\nno\nt recognize any goodwill impairment in any of the years presented.\n- 96 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n10.\nOther Assets\nThe components of other assets are as follows:\n(1)\nPrimarily CRA-related, including LIHTC investments; also includes investments in FHLB stock of $\n29\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which can only be sold to the issuer at its par value. Any cash dividends received from investments in FHLB stock are recognized as interest revenue in the consolidated statements of income. During 2020, CSB and CSPB became members of the Federal Reserve and as a condition of membership, are required to hold Federal Reserve Stock. As such, other investments also includes investments in FRB stock of $\n191\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\nCapitalized contract costs\nCapitalized contract costs relate to incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, including sales commissions paid to employees for obtaining contracts with clients. These costs are amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over a period that is consistent with how the related revenue is recognized. Capitalized contract costs were $\n303\nmillion and $\n281\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense related to capitalized contract costs was $\n63\nmillion and $\n55\nmillion in 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was recorded in compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income.\n11.\nVariable Interest Entities\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of Schwab’s involvement with VIEs is through CSB’s CRA-related investments and most of those are related to LIHTC investments. As part of CSB’s community reinvestment initiatives, CSB invests in funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties and receives tax credits and other tax benefits for these investments. During 2020 and 2019, CSB recorded amortization of $\n56\nmillion and $\n39\nmillion, respectively, and recognized tax credits and other tax benefits of $\n69\nmillion and $\n47\nmillion, respectively, associated with these investments. The amortization, as well as the tax credits and other tax benefits, are included in taxes on income.\n- 97 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nAggregate assets, liabilities, and maximum exposure to loss\nThe aggregate assets, liabilities, and maximum exposure to loss from those VIEs in which Schwab holds a variable interest, but is not the primary beneficiary, are summarized in the table below:\n(1)\nAggregate assets and aggregate liabilities are included in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)\nOther CRA investments are accounted for as loans at amortized cost, equity method investments, AFS securities, or using the adjusted cost method. Aggregate assets are included in AFS securities, bank loans – net, or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nSchwab’s maximum exposure to loss would result from the loss of the investments, including any committed amounts. CSB’s funding of these remaining commitments is dependent upon the occurrence of certain conditions, and CSB expects to pay substantially all of these commitments between 2021 and 2024. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Schwab did not provide or intend to provide financial or other support to the VIEs that it was not contractually required to provide.\n12.\nBank Deposits\nBank deposits consist of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits as follows:\n13.\nBorrowings\nCSC Senior Notes\nCSC’s Senior Notes are unsecured obligations. CSC may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances. Interest is payable semi-annually for the fixed-rate Senior Notes and quarterly for the floating-rate Senior Notes.\nTDA Senior Notes\nOn October 6, 2020, the effective date of our acquisition of TD Ameritrade, TD Ameritrade’s debt outstanding was recognized at provisional fair value and with no change in existing terms. See Note 3 The TD Ameritrade debt outstanding on the acquisition date included $\n3.6\nbillion par value of TDA Senior Notes. These notes are unsecured obligations. TDA Holding may redeem some or all of the TDA Senior Notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances. Interest is payable semi-annually for the fixed-rate TDA Senior Notes and quarterly for the floating-rate TDA Senior Notes.\n- 98 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe following table lists long-term debt by instrument outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(1)\nMatured on July 22, 2020.\nN/A Not applicable.\n- 99 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nAnnual maturities on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2020, are as follows:\nShort-term borrowings:\nOur banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the FHLB. Amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the amount of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of their investment securities that are pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the collateral pledged provided a total borrowing capacity of $\n55.1\nbillion and $\n34.2\nbillion, respectively, of which\nno\namounts were outstanding at the end of either year.\nAs a condition of the FHLB borrowings, we are required to hold FHLB stock, which was recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The investment in FHLB stock was $\n29\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAdditionally, our banking subsidiaries have access to funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. Amounts available are dependent upon the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the collateral pledged provided total borrowing capacity of $\n7.9\nbillion and $\n8.5\nbillion, respectively, of which\nno\namounts were outstanding at the end of either year.\nDuring 2020, CSB and CSPB became members of the Federal Reserve. As a condition of our Federal Reserve membership, we are required to hold Federal Reserve stock, which totaled $\n191\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\nTD Ameritrade Lines of Credit and Revolving Credit Facilities\nTDAC maintains secured uncommitted lines of credit, under which TDAC borrows on either a demand or short-term basis and pledges client margin securities as collateral. There were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the secured uncommitted lines of credit as of December 31, 2020.\nTDAC has access to\ntwo\nsenior unsecured committed revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $\n1.5\nbillion, consisting of an $\n850\nmillion senior revolving credit facility and a $\n600\nmillion senior revolving credit facility, maturing in April 2021 and April 2022, respectively. There were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the TDAC senior revolving facilities as of December 31, 2020.\nTDA Holding had access to a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $\n300\nmillion. On October 6, 2020, Schwab entered into a guaranty supplement to guarantee the obligations of TD Ameritrade under this credit agreement. The provision of the guaranty supplement by Schwab was a condition for certain financial covenant and reporting obligations being modified in the credit agreement. There were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the TDA Holding revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2020, and effective January 28, 2021, the Company terminated the TDA Holding revolving credit facility.\n- 100 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n14.\nLeases\nThe following table details the amounts and locations of lease assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet:\nLease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company had an immaterial finance lease in 2020 and immaterial sublease income for all periods presented.\nThe components of lease expense are as follows:\n(1)\nRent expense related to operating\nleases was $\n146\nmillion in 2018.\n(2)\nIncludes short-term leases, which are immaterial.\n(3)\nIncludes payments that are entirely variable and amounts that represent the difference between payments based on an index or rate that would be reflected in the lease liability and what is actually incurred.\nThe following tables present supplemental lease information:\n(1)\nOperating lease payments exclude $\n24\nmillion of legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2021 and 2022 with lease terms of\nthree years\nto\n15\nyears.\n15.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLoan Portfolio:\nCSB provides a co-branded loan origination program for CSB clients (the Program) with Quicken Loans, Inc. (Quicken Loans\n®\n). Pursuant to the Program, Quicken Loans originates and services First Mortgages and HELOCs for CSB clients. Under the Program, CSB purchases certain First Mortgages and HELOCs that are originated by Quicken Loans. CSB purchased First Mortgages of $\n8.7\nbillion and $\n4.4\nbillion during 2020 and 2019, respectively. CSB purchased HELOCs with commitments of $\n458\nmillion and $\n242\nmillion during 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n- 101 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe Company’s commitments to extend credit on bank lines of credit and to purchase First Mortgages are as follows:\nGuarantees and indemnifications:\nSchwab has clients that sell (i.e., write) listed option contracts that are cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation – a clearing house that establishes margin requirements on these transactions. We partially satisfy the margin requirements by arranging unsecured standby LOCs, in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation, which are issued by several banks. At December 31, 2020, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $\n15\nmillion. There were\nno\nfunds drawn under any of these LOCs at December 31, 2020. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company’s liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly,\nno\nliability has been recognized for these guarantees.\nEffective October 6, 2020, the Company acquired TD Ameritrade. The TD Ameritrade broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries’ operations include the execution, settlement, and financing of various client securities, options, futures and foreign exchange transactions. These activities may expose the Company to credit risk and losses in the event the clients are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations. TD Ameritrade is a member of and provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements. TD Ameritrade also engages third-party firms to clear clients’ futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients’ foreign exchange trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for any loss that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by TD Ameritrade. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly,\nno\nliability has been recognized for these guarantees.\nIDA agreement:\nThe Company’s IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions became effective on October 6, 2020. The IDA agreement creates responsibilities of the Company and certain contingent obligations. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, cash held in eligible brokerage client accounts must be swept off-balance sheet to money market deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides marketing, recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the money market deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee, determined by reference to certain yields, less a service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions, FDIC deposit assessments, and interest on deposits paid to clients. Though unlikely, in the event the sweep arrangement fee computation were to result in a negative amount in any given month, Schwab would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions.\nPursuant to the IDA agreement, Schwab will be required to move all uninsured IDA balances out of the IDA sweep program on June 30, 2021. The IDA agreement also provides that, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab will have the option to migrate up to $\n10\nbillion of IDA balances every 12 months to Schwab’s balance sheet, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. The Company’s ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the IDA agreement, including the requirement that Schwab can only move IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. The amount of Schwab’s initial potential transfer will also be affected by the net growth or decline in the IDA balance from immediately prior to the October 6, 2020 effective date of the IDA agreement through June 30, 2021. In addition, Schwab also must maintain a minimum $\n50\nbillion IDA balance through June 2031, and at least\n80\n% of the IDA balances must be designated as fixed-rate obligations through June 2026.\n- 102 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe total ending IDA balance was $\n144.6\nbillion as of October 5, 2020, and $\n154.1\nbillion as of December 31, 2020. Were IDA balances to decline below the required IDA balance minimum, Schwab could be required to direct additional sweep cash from its balance sheet to the IDA program.\nLegal contingencies:\nSchwab is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. The Company is also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.\nPredicting the outcome of a litigation or regulatory matter is inherently difficult, requiring significant judgment and evaluation of various factors, including the procedural status of the matter and any recent developments; prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases; available defenses, including potential opportunities to dispose of a case on the merits or procedural grounds before trial (e.g., motions to dismiss or for summary judgment); the progress of fact discovery; the opinions of counsel and experts regarding potential damages; and potential opportunities for settlement and the status of any settlement discussions. It may not be reasonably possible to estimate a range of potential liability until the matter is closer to resolution – pending, for example, further proceedings, the outcome of key motions or appeals, or discussions among the parties. Numerous issues may have to be developed, such as discovery of important factual matters and determination of threshold legal issues, which may include novel or unsettled questions of law. Reserves are established or adjusted or further disclosure and estimates of potential loss are provided as the matter progresses and more information becomes available.\nSchwab believes it has strong defenses in all significant matters currently pending and is contesting liability and any damages claimed. Nevertheless, some of these matters may result in adverse judgments or awards, including penalties, injunctions or other relief, and the Company may also determine to settle a matter because of the uncertainty and risks of litigation. Described below are matters in which there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss could be incurred or where the matter may otherwise be of significant interest to stockholders. Unless otherwise noted, the Company is unable to provide a reasonable estimate of any potential liability given the stage of proceedings in the matter. With respect to all other pending matters, based on current information and consultation with counsel, it does not appear reasonably possible that the outcome of any such matter would be material to the financial condition, operating results, or cash flows of the Company.\nCrago Order Routing Litigation\n: On July 13, 2016, a securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a putative class of customers executing equity orders through CS&Co. The lawsuit names CS&Co and CSC as defendants and alleges that an agreement under which CS&Co routed orders to UBS Securities LLC between July 13, 2011 and December 31, 2014 violated CS&Co’s duty to seek best execution. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, interest, injunctive and equitable relief, and attorneys’ fees and costs. After a first amended complaint was dismissed with leave to amend, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 14, 2017. Defendants again moved to dismiss, and in a decision issued December 5, 2017, the court denied the motion. Defendants have answered the complaint to deny all allegations, and are vigorously contesting the lawsuit.\nFord Order Routing Litigation\n: On September 15, 2014, TDA Holding, TD Ameritrade, Inc. and its former CEO, Frederick J. Tomczyk, were sued on behalf of a putative class of TD Ameritrade, Inc. clients alleging that defendants failed to seek best execution and made misrepresentations and omissions regarding its order routing practices. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and injunctive and other relief. On September 14, 2018, the District Court granted plaintiff’s motion for class certification, and defendants petitioned for an immediate appeal of the District Court’s class certification decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, granted defendants’ petition on December 18, 2018, and a decision on defendants’ appeal is pending. Defendants are vigorously contesting the lawsuit, and the Company is unable to predict the outcome or the potential loss, if any, that may result.\nTD Ameritrade Acquisition Litigation\n: As disclosed previously, Schwab and TD Ameritrade have been responding to a lawsuit challenging the acquisition which was filed on May 12, 2020 in the Delaware Court of Chancery (Hawkes v. Bettino et al.) on behalf of a proposed class of TD Ameritrade’s stockholders, excluding, among others, TD Bank. The initial complaint named as defendants each member of the TD Ameritrade board of directors at the time the acquisition was approved, as well as TD Bank and Schwab. On June 11, 2020, plaintiff dismissed a claim that had sought to enjoin voting on or consummation of the acquisition. On February 5, 2021, plaintiff filed an amended complaint naming an officer and certain directors of TD Ameritrade at the time the acquisition was approved, as well as TD Bank, certain TD Bank related entities, and Schwab. The amended complaint asserts separate claims for breach of fiduciary duty by the TD Ameritrade officer, certain members of the TD Ameritrade board and TD Bank, and against Schwab for aiding and abetting such\n- 103 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nbreaches, the allegation being that the amendment of the Insured Deposit Account Agreement TD Bank negotiated directly with Schwab allowed TD Bank to divert merger consideration from TD Ameritrade’s minority public stockholders. Plaintiff seeks to recover monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees. Schwab and the other defendants consider the allegations to be entirely without merit and are contesting the remaining claims in the lawsuit.\n16.\nExit and Other Related Liabilities\nThe integration of TD Ameritrade’s operations is expected to occur over 18 to 36 months from the October 6, 2020 acquisition date. To achieve our integration objectives, the Company expects to recognize significant additional acquisition and integration-related costs and capital expenditures throughout the integration process. Such acquisition and integration-related costs have included and are expected to continue to include professional fees, such as legal, advisory, and accounting fees, costs for technology enhancements, and compensation and benefits expenses for employees and contractors involved in the integration work.\nThe Company’s acquisition and integration-related spending also includes exit and other related costs, such as severance and other employee termination benefits, retention costs, as well as costs related to facility closures, including accelerated depreciation or impairments of assets in those locations. Exit and other related costs are a component of the Company’s overall acquisition and integration-related spending, and support the Company’s ability to achieve integration objectives including expected synergies.\nThe Company is in the early stages of integration, and our estimates of the nature, amounts, and timing of recognition of acquisition and integration-related costs are subject to change based on a number of factors, including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the heightened uncertainty of the current economic environment. More specifically, factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integration-related costs include the level of employee attrition, workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles, changes in the levels of client activity, and increased real estate-related exit cost variability due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInclusive of costs recognized in 2020, Schwab currently expects to incur total exit and other related costs for the integration of TD Ameritrade ranging from $\n650\nmillion to $\n1\nbillion, consisting of employee compensation and benefits, facility exit costs, and certain other costs. During 2020, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $\n186\nmillion for acquisition-related exit costs. The Company expects the remaining exit and other related costs be incurred and charged to expense over the next\n15\nto\n33\nmonths. In addition to ASC 420\nExit or Disposal Cost Obligations\n, certain of the costs associated with these activities are accounted for in accordance with ASC 360\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n, ASC 712\nCompensation\n–\nNonretirement Post Employment Benefits\n, ASC 718\nCompensation\n–\nStock Compensation\n, and ASC 842\nLeases\n.\nThe following is a summary of the activity in the Company’s exit and other related liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n(1)\nCosts incurred for severance pay and other termination benefits, as well as retention costs, are included in employee compensation and benefits on the consolidated statements of income.\n(2)\nIncluded in accrued and expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n- 104 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe following table summarizes the exit and other related costs incurred by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2020, which represents cumulative costs incurred to date:\n(1)\nCosts related to facility closures. These costs, which are comprised of accelerated amortization of ROU assets and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, relate to the impact of abandoning leased and other properties.\n17.\nFinancial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk\nResale agreements:\nSchwab enters into collateralized resale agreements principally with other broker-dealers, which could result in losses in the event the counterparty fails to purchase the securities held as collateral for the cash advanced and the fair value of the securities declines. To mitigate this risk, Schwab requires that the counterparty deliver securities to a custodian, to be held as collateral, with a fair value at or in excess of the resale price. Schwab also sets standards for the credit quality of the counterparty, monitors the fair value of the underlying securities as compared to the related receivable, including accrued interest, and requires additional collateral where deemed appropriate. The collateral provided under these resale agreements is utilized to meet obligations under broker-dealer client protection rules, which place limitations on our ability to access such segregated securities. For Schwab to repledge or sell this collateral, we would be required to deposit cash and/or securities of an equal amount into our segregated reserve bank accounts in order to meet our segregated cash and investment requirement. Schwab’s resale agreements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not subject to master netting arrangements.\nSecurities lending:\nSchwab loans brokerage client securities temporarily to other brokers and clearing houses in connection with its securities lending activities and receives cash as collateral for the securities loaned. Increases in security prices may cause the fair value of the securities loaned to exceed the amount of cash received as collateral. In the event the counterparty to these transactions does not return the loaned securities or provide additional cash collateral, we may be exposed to the risk of acquiring the securities at prevailing market prices in order to satisfy our client obligations. Schwab mitigates this risk by requiring credit approvals for counterparties, monitoring the fair value of securities loaned, and requiring additional cash as collateral when necessary. In addition, most of our securities lending transactions are through a program with a clearing organization, which guarantees the return of cash to us. We also borrow securities from other broker-dealers to fulfill short sales by brokerage clients and deliver cash to the lender in exchange for the securities. The fair value of these borrowed securities was $\n852\nmillion and $\n719\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our securities lending transactions are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements with other broker-dealers; however, we do not net securities lending transactions. Therefore, the securities loaned and securities borrowed are presented gross in the consolidated balance sheets.\n- 105 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe following table presents information about our resale agreements and securities lending activity depicting the potential effect of rights of setoff between these recognized assets and recognized liabilities.\n(1)\nIncluded in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)\nActual collateral was greater than or equal to the value of the related assets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of collateral received in connection with resale agreements that are available to be repledged or sold was $\n15.2\nbillion and $\n9.2\nbillion, respectively.\n(3)\nIncluded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n(4)\nIncluded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The cash collateral received from counterparties under securities lending transactions was equal to or greater than the market value of the securities loaned at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(5)\nSecurities loaned are predominantly comprised of equity securities held in client brokerage accounts with overnight and continuous remaining contractual maturities.\nClient trade settlement:\nSchwab is obligated to settle transactions with brokers and other financial institutions even if our clients fail to meet their obligations to us. Clients are required to complete their transactions on settlement date, generally two business days after the trade date. If clients do not fulfill their contractual obligations, we may incur losses. We have established procedures to reduce this risk by requiring deposits from clients in excess of amounts prescribed by regulatory requirements for certain types of trades, and therefore the potential to make payments under these client transactions is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these transactions.\n- 106 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nMargin lending:\nClients with margin loans have agreed to allow Schwab to pledge collateralized securities in their brokerage accounts in accordance with federal regulations. The following table summarizes the fair value of client securities that were available, under such regulations, that could have been used as collateral, as well as the fair value of securities that we had pledged under such regulations and from securities borrowed transactions:\nNote:  Excludes amounts available and pledged for securities lending from fully-paid client securities. The fair value of fully-paid client securities available and pledged was $\n183\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and $\n142\nmillion as of December 31, 2019.\n(1)\nSecurities pledged to fulfill client margin requirements for open option contracts established with the Options Clearing Corporation.\n- 107 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n18.\nFair Values of Assets and Liabilities\nFor a description of the fair value hierarchy and Schwab’s fair value methodologies, including the use of independent third-party pricing services, see Note 2.

In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company issued shares of CSC common stock and a new, nonvoting class of CSC common stock. Immediately prior to the acquisition, on October 6, 2020, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to create the nonvoting class of common stock with\n300\nmillion shares authorized for issuance and to increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock by the same amount. Each share of nonvoting common stock has identical rights, including liquidation and dividend rights, except that holders of nonvoting common stock have no voting rights other than over matters that significantly and adversely affect the rights or preferences of the nonvoting common stock, or as required by applicable law. Holders of nonvoting common stock are restricted from transferring shares except for permitted inside or outside transfers, as defined in the certificate of incorporation. Shares of nonvoting stock transferred in a permitted outside transfer are automatically converted to shares of common stock.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, CSC issued approximately\n177\nmillion shares of common stock and approximately\n77\nmillion shares of nonvoting common stock to TD Bank and its affiliates on October 6, 2020. Those shares of common stock and nonvoting common stock were issued in reliance upon an exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Following this issuance, TD Bank exchanged an aggregate of approximately\n2\nmillion shares of CSC common stock for an equal number of shares of CSC nonvoting common stock and held approximately\n79\nmillion shares of nonvoting common stock as of December 31, 2020. TD Bank and its affiliates are not permitted to own more than\n9.9\n% of CSC common stock. This limit is interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the Federal Reserve and includes shares of CSC common stock deemed to be beneficially owned directly or indirectly by TD Bank and its affiliates.\nCSC did\nno\nt issue any shares of common stock through external offerings during 2019 or 2018.\nOn December 11, 2020, the Company issued and sold\n2,500,000\ndepositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of\n4.000\n% fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series H, $\n.01\npar value per share, with a liquidation preference of $\n100,000\nper share (equivalent of $\n1,000\nper Depositary Share). The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $\n2.47\nbillion, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses.\nOn April 30, 2020, the Company issued and sold\n2,500,000\ndepositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of\n5.375\n% fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series G, $\n.01\npar value per share, with a liquidation preference of $\n100,000\nper share (equivalent of $\n1,000\nper Depositary Share). The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $\n2.47\nbillion, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses.\nOn January 30, 2019, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new Share Repurchase Program to repurchase up to $\n4.0\nbillion of common stock. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date. There were\nno\nrepurchases of CSC’s common stock under this authorization during the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2019, CSC repurchased\n55\nmillion shares of its common stock under this authorization for $\n2.2\nbillion.\nOn October 25, 2018, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors terminated the previous two share repurchase authorizations and replaced them with an authorization to repurchase up to $\n1.0\nbillion of common stock. CSC repurchased\n22\nmillion shares for $\n1.0\nbillion in 2018, completing all repurchases under this authorization.\n- 112 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nCSC was authorized to issue\n9,940,000\nshares of preferred stock, $\n.01\npar value, at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe following is a summary of CSC’s non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding as of such dates:\n(1)\nRepresented by depositary shares, except for Series A.\n(2)\nThe Series G dividend rate resets on each\nfive\n-year anniversary beginning on June 1, 2025 based on a\nfive\n-year treasury rate, representing the average of the yields on actively traded U.S. treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity for\nfive\n-year maturities. Series G is only redeemable on reset dates. The dividend rates for all other series of preferred stock, except for Series H, will float based on LIBOR.\n(3)\nThe Series H dividend rate resets on each\nten\n-year anniversary beginning on December 1, 2030 based on a\nten\n-year treasury rate, representing the average of the yields on actively traded U.S. treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity for\nten\n-year maturities. Series H is only redeemable on dividend payment dates on or after the first reset date. The dividend rates for all other series of preferred stock, except for Series G, will float based on LIBOR.\nN/A Not applicable.\nDividends declared on the Company’s preferred stock are as follows:\n(1)\nSeries G Preferred Stock was issued on April 30, 2020. Dividends are paid quarterly, and the first dividend was paid on September 1, 2020.\n(2)\nSeries H Preferred Stock was issued on December 11, 2020. Dividends are paid quarterly beginning on March 1, 2021.\nN/A Not applicable.\nDividends on CSC’s preferred stock are not cumulative and will only be paid on a series of preferred stock for a dividend period if declared by CSC’s Board of Directors. Under the terms of each series of preferred stock, CSC’s ability to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on parity with or junior to the series of preferred stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that CSC does not declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the series of preferred stock for the immediately preceding dividend period.\n- 113 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nDividends on fixed-rate preferred stock, as well as Series G and H, are payable quarterly. Dividends on fixed-to-floating-rate preferred stock are payable semi-annually while at a fixed rate and will become payable quarterly after converting to a floating rate.\nRedemption Rights\nEach series of CSC’s preferred stock, except for Series G, may be redeemed at CSC’s option on any dividend payment date on or after the earliest redemption date for that series. Series G preferred stock may be redeemed at CSC’s option on any reset date on or after the earliest redemption date for the series. All outstanding preferred stock series may also be redeemed following a “capital treatment event,” as described in the terms of each series set forth in the relevant certificate of designations. Any redemption of CSC’s preferred stock is subject to approval from the Federal Reserve.\n20.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nAOCI represents cumulative gains and losses that are not reflected in earnings. The components of other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows:\n- 114 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nAOCI balances are as follows:\n(1)\nAs part of the adoption of ASU 2018-02, “\nIncome Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\n”, we elected to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from items in AOCI into retained earnings as of January 1, 2018.\n(2)\nIn the first quarter of 2019, the Company made an election to transfer a portion of its HTM securities to AFS as part of the adoption of ASU 2017-12. The transfer resulted in a net of tax increase to AOCI of $\n19\nmillion. See Note 6 for additional discussion on the 2019 transfer of HTM securities to AFS.\n(3)\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company transferred all of its investment securities designated as HTM to the AFS category. The transfer resulted in a net of tax increase to AOCI of $\n1.1\nbillion. See Note 6 for additional discussion on the 2020 transfer of HTM securities to AFS.\n21.\nEmployee Incentive, Retirement, Deferred Compensation, and Career Achievement Plans\nSchwab’s share-based incentive plans provide for granting options and restricted stock units to employees and directors. In addition, we offer retirement and employee stock purchase plans to eligible employees and sponsor deferred compensation plans for eligible officers and non-employee directors.\nAcquisition of TD Ameritrade\nUpon the completion of the TD Ameritrade acquisition on October 6, 2020, TD Ameritrade’s equity awards, whether vested or unvested, were assumed by the Company and converted into equity awards based on CSC common stock taking into account the defined exchange ratio of\n1.0837\n. Otherwise, these share-based awards are subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable immediately before the merger, except for performance-based restricted stock units which were converted into time-based restricted stock units. The fair value of the stock options assumed by the Company was determined using an option pricing model. The portion of the fair value of the replacement awards related to services provided prior to the acquisition was $\n94\nmillion and was accounted for as consideration transferred. The remaining portion of the fair value of $\n73\nmillion is associated with future services and  had a remaining weighted-average service period of\n1.9\nyears on the acquisition date. A change in the actual or estimated forfeiture rate from the amount originally or subsequently estimated will result in an adjustment to compensation expense based on the full acquisition-date fair value of\n- 115 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nawards not expected to vest, regardless of whether those awards were treated as consideration transferred or stock-based compensation for future services.\nA summary of share-based compensation expense and related income tax benefit is as follows:\n(1)\nRestricted stock unit expense in 2018 includes $\n36\nmillion related to special stock awards issued to non-officer employees.\n(2)\nExcludes income tax benefits from stock options exercised and restricted stock units vested of $\n14\nmillion, $\n23\nmillion, and $\n46\nmillion in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company issues shares for stock options and restricted stock units from treasury stock. At December 31, 2020, the Company was authorized to grant up to\n62\nmillion common shares under its existing stock incentive plans. Additionally, at December 31, 2020, the Company had\n32\nmillion shares reserved for future issuance under its employee stock purchase plan.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $\n289\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized through 2024 with a remaining weighted-average service period of\n0.9\nyears for stock options,\n2.2\nyears for restricted stock units, and\n0.4\nyears for performance-based stock units.\nStock Option Plan\nOptions are granted for the purchase of shares of common stock at an exercise price not less than market value on the date of grant, and expire\nten years\nfrom the date of grant. Options generally vest annually over a\none\n- to\nfour\n-year period from the date of grant.\nStock option activity is summarized below:\n(1)\nNumber of options was less than\n500\nthousand.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between CSC’s closing stock price and the exercise price of each in-the-money option on the last trading day of the period presented.\n- 116 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nInformation on stock options granted and exercised is presented below:\nWe use an option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The model takes into account the contractual term of the stock option, expected volatility, dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate. Expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of publicly-traded options on CSC’s stock. Dividend yield is based on the average historical CSC dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term similar to the contractual term of the option. We use historical option exercise data, which includes employee termination data, to estimate the probability of future option exercises.\nThe assumptions used to value the options granted during the years presented and their expected lives were as follows:\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units are awards that entitle the holder to receive shares of CSC’s common stock following a vesting period. Restricted stock units are restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest annually over a\none\n- to\nfour\n-year period, while performance-based restricted stock units also require the Company achieve certain financial or other measures prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value is amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of the restricted stock units that vested during each of the years 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $\n175\nmillion, $\n123\nmillion, and $\n166\nmillion, respectively.\nThe Company’s restricted stock units activity is summarized below:\n(1)\nNumber of units was less than\n500\nthousand.\nRetirement and Deferred Compensation Plans\nEmployees can participate in Schwab’s qualified retirement plan, the SchwabPlan Retirement Savings and Investment Plan. The Company may match certain employee contributions or make additional contributions to this plan at its discretion. The Company’s total expense was $\n136\nmillion, $\n118\nmillion, and $\n105\nmillion in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n- 117 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nSchwab’s deferred compensation plan for officers permits participants to defer the receipt of certain cash compensation. The deferred compensation plan for non-employee directors permits participants to defer receipt of all or a portion of their director fees and to receive either a grant of stock options, or upon ceasing service as a director, the number of shares of CSC’s common stock that would have resulted from investing the deferred fee amount into CSC’s common stock. The deferred compensation liability was $\n176\nmillion and $\n164\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nEffective upon the completion of the TD Ameritrade acquisition on October 6, 2020, TD Ameritrade’s 401(k) and deferred profit-sharing plans were terminated and TD Ameritrade employees were eligible to participate in the SchwabPlan Retirement Savings and Investment Plan. As of December 31, 2020, there were no TD Ameritrade participants in Schwab’s deferred compensation plan.\nFC Career Achievement Plan\nThe FC career achievement plan is a noncontributory, unfunded, nonqualified plan for eligible FCs. An FC is eligible for earned cash payments after retirement contingent upon meeting certain performance levels, tenure, age, and client transitioning requirements. Allocations to the plan are calculated annually based on performance levels achieved and eligible compensation and are subject to general creditors of the Company. Full vesting occurs when an FC reaches 60 years of age and has at least ten years of service with the Company.\nThe following table presents the changes in projected benefit obligation:\n(1)\nIncludes service cost and interest cost, which are recognized in compensation and benefits expense and other expense, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income.\n(2)\nActuarial (gain)/loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and is included in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(3)\nThis amount is recognized as a liability in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n22.\nTaxes on Income\nThe components of taxes on income are as follows:\n- 118 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe temporary differences that created deferred tax assets and liabilities are detailed below:\n(1)\nAmounts are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows:\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nUnrecognized tax benefits totaled $\n248\nmillion and $\n101\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, $\n202\nmillion and $\n97\nmillion of which if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate.\n- 119 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nInterest and penalties were accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had accrued approximately $\n58\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to routine examinations by the respective federal, state, and applicable local jurisdictions’ taxing authorities. Federal returns for 2017 through 2019 remain subject to examination. The years open to examination by state and local governments vary by jurisdiction.\n23.\nRegulatory Requirements\nCSC is a savings and loan holding company and is subject to examination, supervision, and regulation by the Federal Reserve. During 2020, CSB, CSC’s primary depository institution subsidiary, converted to a Texas-chartered state savings bank and became a member of the Federal Reserve system. CSB is subject to examination, supervision, and regulation by the Federal Reserve, the TDSML, the FDIC as its deposit insurer, and the CFPB. CSC is required to serve as a source of strength for CSB.\nCSB is subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws, including regulatory capital requirements and requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions, such as extensions of credit to, or asset purchases from CSC or its other subsidiaries by CSB. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval of the Federal Reserve and the TDSML to declare dividends to CSC. The federal banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, CSB could be subject to restrictive actions if it were to fall within one of the lowest three of five capital categories. CSC and CSB are required to maintain minimum capital levels as specified in federal banking regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on CSC and CSB. At December 31, 2020, both CSC and CSB met all of their respective capital requirements.\n- 120 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nThe regulatory capital and ratios for CSC (consolidated) and CSB are as follows:\n(1)\nIn the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules adopted in October 2019, Category III banking organizations such as CSC were given the ability to opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and CSC made this opt-out election as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, AOCI is excluded from the amounts and ratios presented as of December 31, 2020. In 2019, CSC and CSB were required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital; the amounts and ratios for December 31, 2019 are presented on this basis.\n(2)\nUnder the Basel III capital rule, CSC and CSB are also required to maintain a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer and countercyclical buffer were 2.5% and zero percent, respectively, for both periods presented. If either buffer falls below the minimum requirement, the Company would be subject to limits on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. At December 31, 2020, the minimum capital requirement plus capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer for Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios were 7.0%, 8.5%, and 10.5%, respectively.\nN/A Not applicable.\nBased on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2020, CSB is considered well capitalized (the highest category) under its respective regulatory capital rules. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2020 that management believes have changed CSB’s capital category.\nEffective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve eliminated a requirement that depository institutions maintain reserve balances at the Federal Reserve based on deposits considered to be transaction accounts. CSB’s average required reserve pursuant to this regulation was $\n1.5\nbillion in 2019. In 2018, the Company established Charles Schwab Trust Bank (Trust Bank) as a Nevada state-chartered savings bank to provide certain trust and custody services. At December 31, 2020, the balance sheets of CSPB and Trust Bank consisted primarily of investment securities, and the entities held total assets of $\n31.6\nbillion and $\n12.5\nbillion, respectively. Based on their regulatory capital ratios, at December 31, 2020, CSPB and Trust Bank are considered well capitalized under their respective regulatory capital rules.\n- 121 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nDuring 2020, CS&Co registered as an FCM with the CFTC, and subsequently, Charles Schwab Futures, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC, transferred its futures business and all of its assets and liabilities to CS&Co. This transfer was accounted for as a common control transaction and did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nAs a securities broker-dealer, CS&Co is subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule, and as an FCM, CS&Co is also subject to net capital requirements under CFTC Regulation 1.17 under the Commodity Exchange Act. CS&Co computes net capital under the alternative method permitted by the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, of the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions or a minimum dollar requirement, which is based on the type of business conducted by CS&Co. CFTC Regulation 1.17 requires maintenance of adjusted net capital equal to or in excess of the greater of (1) $1.0 million; (2) its futures risk-based capital requirement, equal to 8% of the total risk margin requirement for all futures positions carried by the FCM in client and nonclient accounts; (3) the amount of adjusted net capital required by a registered futures association of which it is a member; or (4) for securities brokers and dealers, the amount of net capital required by the Uniform Net Capital Rule.\nCertain subsidiaries of TDA Holding are subject to regulatory capital requirements, including TDAC and TD Ameritrade, Inc. TDAC and TD Ameritrade, Inc. are subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule and compute net capital under the alternative method. TDAC is required to maintain net capital of the greater of $1.5 million, which is based on the type of business conducted by the broker-dealer, or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions. TD Ameritrade, Inc. is required to maintain minimum net capital, as defined, as the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions or a minimum dollar requirement of $250,000, which is based on the type of business conducted by the broker-dealer.\nUnder the alternative method, a broker-dealer may not repay subordinated borrowings, pay cash dividends, or make any unsecured advances or loans if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement.\nNet capital and net capital requirements for CS&Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc., are as follows:\nN/A Not applicable. Net capital amounts and requirements are not presented for TDAC and TD Ameritrade, Inc. prior to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade.\nPursuant to the SEC’s Customer Protection Rule and other applicable regulations, Schwab had cash and investments segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients at December 31, 2020. The SEC’s Customer Protection Rule requires broker-dealers to segregate client fully-paid securities and cash balances not collateralizing margin positions and not swept to money market funds or bank deposit accounts. Amounts included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes represent actual balances on deposit, whereas cash and investments required to be segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2020 for CS&Co totaled $\n39.2\nbillion and for TDAC totaled $\n14.5\nbillion. As of January 5, 2021, CS&Co had deposited $\n4.8\nbillion of cash and qualified securities into its segregated reserve\n- 122 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\naccounts. As of January 4, 2021, TDAC had withdrawn $\n164\nmillion of cash and qualified securities from its segregated reserve accounts. Cash and investments required to be segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2019 for CS&Co totaled $\n23.0\nbillion. Cash and cash equivalents included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes are presented as part of Schwab’s cash balances in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n24.\nSegment Information\nSchwab’s\ntwo\nreportable segments are Investor Services and Advisor Services. Schwab structures the operating segments according to its clients and the services provided to those clients. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the\ntwo\nsegments based on which segment services the client.\nThe Company integrated its business and asset acquisitions during 2020 into its two existing reportable segments. Revenues and expenses from our acquisition of USAA-IMCO are allocated to Investor Services only; revenues and expenses from TD Ameritrade and our other 2020 acquisitions are attributed to Investor Services and Advisor Services based on which segment services the client. See Note 3 for more information regarding business acquisitions.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2. For the computation of its segment information, Schwab utilizes an activity-based costing model to allocate traditional income statement line item expenses (e.g., compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, and professional services) to the business activities driving segment expenses (e.g., client service, opening new accounts, or business development) and a funds transfer pricing methodology to allocate certain revenues.\nManagement evaluates the performance of the segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. There are no revenues from transactions between the segments.\nFinancial information for the segments is presented in the following table:\n(1)\nBeginning in 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.\n(2)\nBeginning in 2020, amortization of acquired intangible assets was reclassified from depreciation and amortization. Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change.\n- 123 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n25.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nEPS is computed using the two-class method. Preferred stock dividends, and undistributed earnings and dividends allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income available to common stockholders. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated similar to basic EPS except that the numerator and denominator are adjusted as necessary for any effects of dilutive potential common shares, which include, if dilutive, outstanding stock options and non-vested restricted stock units.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had voting and nonvoting common stock outstanding. Since the rights of the voting and nonvoting common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, the net income of the Company has been allocated on a proportionate basis to the two classes. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method for outstanding stock options and non-vested restricted stock units and the if-converted method for nonvoting common stock. The if-converted method assumes conversion of all nonvoting common stock to common stock.\nEPS under the basic and diluted computations for both common stock and nonvoting common stock are as follows:\n(1)\nNonvoting common stock was issued on October 6, 2020 in conjunction with the acquisition of TD Ameritrade. As such, nonvoting common stock is not applicable for the basic and diluted EPS computations in 2019 and 2018.\n(2)\nIncludes preferred stock dividends and undistributed earnings and dividends allocated to non-vested restricted stock units.\n(3)\nAntidilutive stock options and restricted stock units excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS totaled\n22\nmillion,\n21\nmillion, and\n18\nmillion in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nN/A Not applicable.\n- 124 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n26.\nThe Charles Schwab Corporation – Parent Company Only Financial Statements\nCondensed Statements of Income\n(1)\nIncludes preferred stock dividends and undistributed earnings and dividends allocated to non-vested restricted stock units.\nCondensed Balance Sheets\n- 125 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\nCondensed Statements of Cash Flows\n- 126 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n27.\nQuarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\n(1)\nThe fourth quarter of 2020 includes TD Ameritrade in our consolidated results of operations and financial condition starting on the acquisition date, October 6, 2020. Refer to Item 8 – Note 3 for further information regarding the acquisition of TD Ameritrade.\n(2)\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company had voting and nonvoting common stock outstanding. As the participation rights, including dividend and liquidation rights, are identical between the voting and nonvoting stock classes, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same for each class.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nAs described in\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (TD Ameritrade), which was acquired on October 6, 2020, and whose financial information constitute 14% of the Company’s total assets, 15% of revenues, and 18% of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at TD Ameritrade.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\n- 128 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAsset Management and Administration Fees (AMAF) – Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nCertain revenues included in asset management and administrative fees are generated through third-party mutual fund and exchange-traded funds (ETF) offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. These AMAF revenues are made up of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions, and use automated systems to process and record these transactions based on underlying information sourced from multiple systems and contractual terms with individual investors and third-party mutual funds.\nGiven that the Company’s process to record revenue is highly automated and involves multiple systems and databases, auditing these revenue streams was complex and challenging due to the extent of audit effort required and involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology (IT) necessary for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company’s systems, software applications, and automated controls.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s systems to process the AMAF revenue transactions included the following, among others:\n•\nWith the assistance of our IT specialists, we:\n◦\nIdentified the significant systems used to process revenue transactions and, using a risk-based approach, tested the relevant general IT controls over each of these systems.\n◦\nPerformed testing of automated business controls and system interface controls (including batch processing) within the relevant revenue streams.\n•\nWe tested internal controls within the relevant revenue business processes, including those in place to reconcile the various systems to the Company’s general ledger.\n•\nWe created data visualizations to evaluate recorded revenue and evaluate trends in the revenue data.\n•\nFor a sample of revenue transactions, we performed detail transaction testing by agreeing the amounts recognized to contractual agreements and testing the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue.\n•\nFor a sample of accounts, we tested the accuracy and completeness of assets under management by obtaining independent pricing support and reconciling total positions to third-party statements.\nPurchase Price Accounting for the TD Ameritrade Acquisition – Client Relationship Intangible Asset – Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nOn October 6, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of TD Ameritrade for approximately $22 billion in common stock. The Company accounted for the TD Ameritrade acquisition as a business combination under GAAP and, accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, including client relationship intangible assets of $8.7 billion. The estimated fair value of client relationships were estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method. The multi-period excess earnings method starts\n- 129 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nwith a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the asset. The forecast is then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the cash flow stream.\nGiven the fair value determination of client relationship intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the determination of net future cash flows, and the selection of the respective discount rates, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the determination of net future cash flows and the selection of the discount rate relating to the client relationship intangible assets included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the determination of forecasted net future cash flows, selection of the discount rate and the valuation methodology used.\n•\nWe assessed the knowledge, skill, ability and objectivity of management’s valuation specialist and evaluated the work performed.\n•\nWith the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of (1) the valuation methodologies used and (2) discount rate by:\n◦\nTesting the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\n◦\nDeveloping a range of independent estimates of the discount rate and comparing to the discount rate utilized by management.\n•\nWhen assessing the reasonableness of assumptions related to net future cash flows for client relationship intangible assets, we evaluated whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the past performance of the acquired company and the Company’s strategic plan going forward.\n•\nWe evaluated whether the assumptions used to estimate net future cash flows were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 24, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1976.\n- 130 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\nManagement’s\nReport on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of The Charles Schwab Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (the Company), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of and effected by the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nAs of December 31, 2020, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff guidance, this assessment has excluded TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (TD Ameritrade), as described below. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nEffective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. Due to the significance of the acquisition and the complexity of TD Ameritrade’s systems and business processes, management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 excludes TD Ameritrade from that assessment. TD Ameritrade’s assets represented approximately 14% of the Company’s consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2020, and its revenues and net income for the period from the acquisition through December 31, 2020 represented approximately 15% and 18%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated total net revenues and net income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on the previous pages.\n- 131 -\nTHE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION"

Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\n: Effective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. In conducting its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, as permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff guidance, management has elected to exclude TD Ameritrade from that assessment. TD Ameritrade’s assets represented approximately 14% of the Company’s consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2020, and its revenues and net income for the period from the acquisition through December 31, 2020 represented approximately 15% and 18%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated total net revenues and net income for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, management is in the process of integrating TD Ameritrade into the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nOther than as discussed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm are included in Item 8."
